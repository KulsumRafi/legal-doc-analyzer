                                         CONVERTIBLE NOTE

                  FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED,  PATH 1  NETWORK  TECHNOLOGIES  INC.,  a
Delaware  corporation (the "BORROWER"),  hereby promises to pay to LAURUS MASTER
FUND,  LTD.,  c/o  Ironshore  Corporate  Services  Ltd.,  P.O.  Box  1234  G.T.,
Queensgate  House,  South Church  Street,  Grand Cayman,  Cayman  Islands,  Fax:
345-949-9877 (the "HOLDER") or its registered assigns or successors in interest,
on order, without demand, the outstanding  principal amount of all loans made by
the Holder to the Borrower  under the terms of this Note (each an "Advance"  and
collectively  the  "Advances").  The aggregate  principal amount of all Advances
outstanding hereunder shall not exceed ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000),  and no
Advance shall be made after February 18, 2006 (the "Maturity Date").  The amount
and date of each Advance shall be entered by the Holder into  Holder's  records,
which records shall be conclusive  evidence of the subject matter thereof absent
manifest error.

                  Capitalized  terms used herein without  definition  shall have
the  meanings  ascribed to such terms in the  Purchase  and  Security  Agreement
between  the  Borrower  and the  Holder  dated the date  hereof  (the  "PURCHASE
AGREEMENT").

                  The following terms shall apply to this Note:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    INTEREST

                  1.1  Interest  Rate.  Except as modified by Section 1.2 below,
the Borrower  shall pay interest at the  Contract  Rate on the unpaid  principal
balance  of the Note  until  such time as such  balance  or  portion  thereof is
collected  in full in good funds in dollars  of the  United  States of  America.
Interest  shall be payable in arrears  commencing one month from the date hereof
and on the first business day of each consecutive calendar month thereafter, and
on the Maturity  Date,  accelerated  or otherwise,  due and payable as described
below.

                  1.2 Default Rate. After the Default Notice Period, the Default
Rate,  as defined in the  Purchase  Agreement,  shall apply to the amounts  owed
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE II

                               ADVANCES UNDER NOTE

         2.1      Authorized Person.

                  (a) Any officer of the Borrower who has been  disclosed to the
Holder in writing as an  authorized  officer for such  purposes (an  "AUTHORIZED
PERSON")  may  request an Advance  on any day other than a  Saturday,  Sunday or
other day when  commercial  banks located in New York, New York are not open for
commercial banking business.  Such request shall be made in writing delivered to
the Holder by not later than 12:00 p.m. on the day of the requested Advance.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes the Holder to rely upon the
written  instructions  of  any  person  identifying  himself  or  herself  as an
Authorized  Person  and upon any  signature  which  the  Holder  believes  to be
genuine,  and the Borrower  shall be bound thereby in the same manner as if such
person were authorized or such signature were genuine.

         2.2 Limitation on Advances.  It is expressly understood that the Holder
is under no  obligation  to make any  Advance  to the  Borrower  under this Note
(whether  by reason of any  provision  hereof or  otherwise)  (i) if an Event of
Default, as hereinafter defined, has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) if such
Advance or any part  thereof  would cause the  aggregate  amount of all Advances
made hereunder to exceed the Accounts Availability.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                CONVERSION RIGHTS


<PAGE>


                  3.1. Conversion into the Borrower's Common Stock.

                  (a) To the extent that Advances have been made hereunder,  the
Holder  shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  from and after the date
hereof,  and then at any time until the Maturity  Date, to convert the principal
portion of the Advances made hereunder  and/or interest and fees due and payable
into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Borrower as such
stock  exists on the date of  issuance  of this  Note,  or any shares of capital
stock of the  Borrower  into  which  such stock  shall  hereafter  be changed or
reclassified  (the  "COMMON  STOCK")  at the Fixed  Conversion  Price as defined
below.  In the event that the Holder  elects to  convert  this Note into  Common
Stock (to the extent  permitted  herein),  the Holder  shall give notice of such
election by delivering an executed and completed  notice of conversion  ("NOTICE
OF  CONVERSION")  to the Borrower and such Notice of Conversion  shall provide a
breakdown in  reasonable  detail of the amount of Note  principal,  interest and
fees that are being converted.  On each Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined)
and in  accordance  with its Notice of  Conversion,  the  Holder  shall make the
appropriate  reduction  to the  Advances,  interest  and fees as  entered in its
records  and shall  provide  written  notice  thereof to the  Borrower  within 2
business  days  after  the  Conversion  Date.  Each  date on which a  Notice  of
Conversion is delivered or  telecopied  to the Borrower in  accordance  with the
provisions  hereof shall be deemed a Conversion Date (the "CONVERSION  DATE"). A
form of Notice of  Conversion  that may be  employed  by the  Holder is  annexed
hereto as Exhibit A. The Borrower will cause the transfer  agent to transmit the
certificates   representing  the  shares  of  the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon
conversion  of the Note to the Holder by  crediting  the account of the Holder's
designated  broker with the Depository  Trust  Corporation  ("DTC")  through its
Deposit  Withdrawal Agent  Commission  ("DWAC") system within three (3) business
days after  receipt by the Borrower of the Notice of Conversion  (the  "DELIVERY
DATE").

                  In the case of the exercise of the conversion rights set forth
herein the conversion  privilege  shall be deemed to have been exercised and the
shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon such  conversion  shall be deemed to have
been  issued  upon  the  date  of  receipt  by the  Borrower  of the  Notice  of
Conversion. The Holder shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of
such Common Stock, unless the Holder provides the Borrower written  instructions
to the contrary.

                  (b)  Subject to  adjustment  as  provided  in  Section  3.1(e)
hereof,  the  Conversion  Price per share shall be $1.13 (the "FIXED  CONVERSION
PRICE.") If after the Default  Notice Period (as defined below) the Borrower has
not repaid in full the amounts then due hereunder or cured the Event of Default,
then the  Conversion  Price  shall be reduced and shall be equal to the lower of
(i) the Fixed  Conversion  Price; or (ii) eighty percent (80%) of the average of
the three lowest closing prices for the Common Stock on NASD OTC Bulletin Board,
NASDAQ SmallCap Market, NASDAQ National Market System,  American Stock Exchange,
or New  York  Stock  Exchange  (whichever  of the  foregoing  is at the time the
principal  trading  exchange  or market for the  Common  Stock,  the  "PRINCIPAL
Market"),  or on any securities exchange or other securities market on which the
Common  Stock is then being  listed or traded,  for the thirty (30) trading days
prior to but not including the Conversion Date.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Holder  shall not be entitled to convert  pursuant to the terms of this Note
an amount that would be  convertible  into that number of shares of Common Stock
which would exceed the  difference  between the number of shares of Common Stock
beneficially  owned by such holder or issuable upon exercise of warrants held by
such holder and 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Borrower.
For the purposes of the immediately  preceding  sentence,  beneficial  ownership
shall be  determined  in  accordance  with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
Regulation  13d-3  thereunder.  The  Holder may void the  conversion  limitation
described  in this  section upon 75 days prior notice to the Borrower or upon an
Event of Default hereunder.

                  (d) The Borrower  understands  that a delay in the delivery of
the shares of Common Stock in the form required  pursuant to this Article beyond
the Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder.  As  compensation
to the Holder for such loss,  the  Borrower  agrees to pay late  payments to the
Holder for late  issuance  of the such shares in the form  required  pursuant to
this Article III upon conversion of the Note, in the amount equal to the greater
of (i) $500 per  business day after the  Delivery  Date and (ii) the  Borrower's
actual damages from such delayed  delivery.  The Borrower shall pay any payments
incurred under this Section in immediately  available  funds upon demand and, in
the case of actual  damages,  accompanied  by  reasonable  documentation  of the
amount of such damages.

                  (e) The  Conversion  Price  and  number  and kind of shares or
other  securities  to be issued upon  conversion  shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time upon the  happening of certain  events  while this  conversion
right remains outstanding, as follows):


<PAGE>


                           A. Merger,  Sale of Assets,  etc. The Borrower at any
time shall consolidate with

or merge into or sell or convey all or substantially all its assets to any other
corporation,  this Note, as to the unpaid principal  portion thereof and accrued
interest  thereon  shall  thereafter be deemed to evidence the right to purchase
such number and kind of shares or other  securities  and  property as would have
been issuable or distributable on account of such consolidation, merger, sale or
conveyance,  upon or with  respect to the  number of shares of Common  Stock the
Holder could have acquired immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale
or  conveyance  based on the Fixed  Conversion  Price Cap as of the closing date
thereof.   The  foregoing   provision   shall   similarly  apply  to  successive
transactions  of a similar  nature by any such  successor or purchaser.  Without
limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  the provisions of this Section shall
apply  to  such  securities  of such  successor  or  purchaser  after  any  such
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance.

                           B. Reclassification, etc. If the Borrower at any time
shall, by reclassification

or  otherwise,  change the Common  Stock into the same or a different  number of
securities  of any class or  classes,  this  Note,  as to the  unpaid  principal
portion  thereof and accrued  interest  thereon,  shall  thereafter be deemed to
evidence the right to purchase an adjusted number of such securities and kind of
securities as would have been issuable as the result of such change with respect
to the  number of shares of Common  Stock  into  which the Note  would have been
convertible  immediately prior to such  reclassification  or other change at the
Fixed  Conversion  Price as of the effective date for such  reclassification  or
change.

                           C. Stock Splits,  Combinations and Dividends.  If the
shares of Common Stock are

subdivided  or  combined  into a greater or  smaller  number of shares of Common
Stock,  or if a dividend is paid on the Common Stock in shares of Common  Stock,
the  Fixed  Conversion  Price  shall  be  proportionately  reduced  in  case  of
subdivision of shares or stock dividend or proportionately increased in the case
of combination of shares,  in each such case by the ratio which the total number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding  immediately after such event bears to the
total number of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior to such
event.

                           D. Share Issuance.  Subject to the provisions of this
Section, if the Borrower at

any time shall issue any shares of Common Stock prior to the  conversion  of the
portion  of the  principal  amount  of the  Note  permitted  by  Section  3.1(a)
(otherwise than as: (i) provided in Sections 3.1(e)A, 3.1(e)B or 3.1(e)C or this
subparagraph  D; or (ii)  pursuant to warrants or options that may be granted in
the future under any option plan of the Borrower,  or any employment  agreement,
joint venture, credit, leasing or other financing agreement or any joint venture
or other strategic arrangement,  in each case now or hereinafter entered into by
the Borrower, (iii) pursuant to any agreement entered into by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries  for the acquisition of another  business  (whether by stock
purchase or asset purchase, merger or otherwise; ((i), (ii) and (iii) above, are
hereinafter  referred to as the "EXCLUDED  ISSUANCES")) for a consideration less
than the  Fixed  Conversion  Price  that  would be in effect at the time of such
issue,  then,  and  thereafter  successively  upon  each such  issue,  the Fixed
Conversion Price shall be reduced as follows: (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior to such issue shall be  multiplied by the
Fixed Conversion Price in effect at the time of such issue and the product shall
be added to the aggregate  consideration,  if any, received by the Borrower upon
such issue of additional  shares of Common  Stock;  and (ii) the sum so obtained
shall be divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such issue. The resulting  quotient shall be the adjusted Fixed Conversion
Price.  Except for the Excluded  Issuances for purposes of this adjustment,  the
issuance of any  security of the  Borrower  carrying  the right to convert  such
security  into  shares of  Common  Stock or of any  warrant,  right or option to
purchase Common Stock shall result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price upon
the  issuance  of shares of Common  Stock upon  exercise of such  conversion  or
purchase rights.


<PAGE>


                  (f)  During  the  period  the  conversion  right  exists,  the
Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion
of this Note to the extent permitted by Section 3.1(a). The Borrower  represents
that upon issuance,  such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.  The Borrower  agrees that the Borrower's  issuance of this Note
shall constitute full authority to the Borrower's officers, agents, and transfer
agents who are charged with the duty of executing and issuing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary  certificates for shares of Common Stock upon
the conversion of this Note.

                  3.2   Registration   Rights.   The  Holder  has  been  granted
registration  rights with  respect to the shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon
conversion  of this  Note as more  fully  set  forth  in a  Registration  Rights
Agreement dated the date hereof (the "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.")

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                EVENT OF DEFAULT

                  If an Event of Default  occurs and is  continuing,  the Holder
may make all sums of principal, accrued but unpaid interests and other fees then
remaining unpaid hereon and all other amounts payable  hereunder due and payable
within 5 days of written notice from the Holder to the Borrower (each occurrence
being a "DEFAULT NOTICE  PERIOD") of an Event of Default (as defined below).  If
during the Default Notice Period,  the Borrower cures the Event of Default,  the
Event of Default will no longer  exist and any rights the Holder had  pertaining
to the Event of Default will no longer exist.

                  The  occurrence of any of the following  events is an Event of
Default ("EVENT OF DEFAULT"):

                  4.1 Failure to Pay  Principal,  Interest  or other  Fees.  The
Borrower  fails to pay any  installment  of  principal,  interest  or other fees
hereon or on any other  promissory  note issued  pursuant to the Loan Agreement,
Registration Rights Agreement and this Note when due.

                  4.2 Failure to Deliver Common Stock or  Replacement  Note. The
Borrower's  failure to timely deliver Common Stock to the Holder pursuant to and
in the form required by this Note.

                  4.3 Breach of  Covenant.  The  Borrower  breaches any material
covenant or other term or  condition  of this Note,  the Loan  Agreement  or the
Registration Rights Agreement in any material respect.

                  4.4 Breach of  Representations  and  Warranties.  Any material
representation  or warranty of the Borrower made herein,  in the Loan Agreement,
or in any agreement,  statement or certificate  given in writing pursuant hereto
or in connection therewith shall be false or misleading.

                  4.5 Stop Trade.  An SEC stop trade order or  Principal  Market
trading suspension of the Common Stock for 5 consecutive days or 5 days during a
period  of 10  consecutive  days,  excluding  in all cases a  suspension  of all
trading on a Principal Market.


<PAGE>



                  4.6  Default  Under  Related  Agreement.  An Event of  Default
occurs  under and as defined in the Loan  Agreement  dated as of the date hereof
between  Borrower and Holder,  as such  agreement  may be amended,  modified and
supplemented from time to time.

                  If an Event of Default  occurs and is  continuing,  the Holder
may make all sums of principal,  interest and other fees then  remaining  unpaid
hereon and all other amounts payable hereunder  immediately due and payable, all
without demand,  presentment or notice, or grace period, all of which hereby are
expressly waived.  In the event of an acceleration,  the amount due and owing to
the Holder shall be 130% of the outstanding  principal  amount of the Note (plus
accrued and unpaid  interest and fees,  if any).  The  remedies  under this Note
shall be cumulative.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  5.1 Failure or Indulgence  Not Waiver.  No failure or delay on
the part of the Holder  hereof in the exercise of any power,  right or privilege
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise  of any  such  power,  right or  privilege  preclude  other or  further
exercise  thereof  or of any other  right,  power or  privilege.  All rights and
remedies existing  hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights
or remedies otherwise available.

                  5.2  Notices.  Any notice  herein  required or permitted to be
given  shall be in  writing  and shall be  deemed  effectively  given:  (a) upon
personal  delivery to the party  notified,  (b) when sent by confirmed  telex or
facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on
the next  business  day, (c) five days after having been sent by  registered  or
certified mail, return receipt requested,  postage prepaid, or (d) one day after
deposit with a nationally  recognized  overnight  courier,  specifying  next day
delivery, with written verification of receipt. All communications shall be sent
to (i) the  Borrower  at the address as set forth on the  signature  page to the
Loan Agreement  executed in connection  herewith and, as the case may be, to the
Borrower at the address as set forth in Section 6(g) of the Registration  Rights
Agreement,  in each case,  and (ii) the Holder at the  address  set forth on the
signature page to the Loan  Agreement for such Holder,  with a copy to Daniel M.
Laifer,  Esq.,  152 West 57th  Street,  4th  Floor,  New York,  New York  10019,
facsimile number (212) 541-4434,  or at such other address as the Borrower,  the
Borrower or the Holder may designate by ten days advance  written  notice to the
other parties hereto made and delivered in accordance with this Section 5.2.

                  5.3  Amendment  Provision.  The term "Note" and all  reference
thereto,  as used  throughout  this  instrument,  shall mean this  instrument as
originally executed, or if later amended or supplemented,  then as so amended or
supplemented.

                  5.4 Assignability. This Note (except for Article III) shall be
binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the
benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns, and may be assigned by the
Holder.  Article III and Article V of this Note (excluding  Section 5.6 and 5.7)
shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns.

                  5.5  Governing  Law.  This  Note  shall  be  governed  by  and
construed in accordance  with the laws of the State of New York,  without regard
to principles of conflicts of laws.  Any action  brought by either party against
the other  concerning the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be
brought only in the state courts of New York or in the federal courts located in
the state of New York; provided,  however that the Purchaser may choose to waive
this provision and bring an action  outside the state of New York.  Both parties
and the individual signing this Note on behalf of the Borrower, the Borrower and
the Holder agree to submit to the  jurisdiction  of such courts.  The prevailing
party  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from the  other  party  its  reasonable
attorney's  fees and  costs.  In the event  that any  provision  of this Note is
invalid or unenforceable  under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such
provision  shall  be  deemed  inoperative  to the  extent  that it may  conflict
therewith  and shall be deemed  modified to conform with such statute or rule of
law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or  unenforceable  under any law
shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision of this
Note.

5.6 Maximum  Payments.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to establish or
require  the  payment of a rate of  interest  or other  charges in excess of the
maximum  permitted  by  applicable  law.  In the event that the rate of interest
required to be paid or other charges  hereunder exceed the maximum  permitted by
such law,  any  payments in excess of such  maximum  shall be  credited  against
amounts owed by the Borrower to the Holder and thus refunded to the Borrower.

5.7  Security  Interest.  The  holder of this Note has been  granted a  security
interest in certain  assets of the  Borrower  more fully  described  in the Loan
Agreement.

                  5.8  Construction.  Each  party  acknowledges  that its  legal
counsel participated in the preparation of this Note and, therefore,  stipulates
that the rule of construction  that  ambiguities are to be resolved  against the
drafting party shall not be applied in the  interpretation of this Note to favor
any party against the other.

its name effective as of this 18th day of February, 2003.
