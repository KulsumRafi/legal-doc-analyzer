SECTION 2. HOLDERS

     A Person is deemed to be a holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (each,
a "Holder") whenever such Person owns Transfer Restricted Securities.

SECTION 3. REGISTERED EXCHANGE OFFER

     (a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted by applicable federal
law or Commission policy (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i)
hereof have been complied with), the Company and the Guarantors shall (i) cause
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be filed with the Commission as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than 90 days
after the Closing Date (such 90th day being the "Exchange Filing Deadline"),
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or prior to 180 days
after the Closing Date (such 180th day being the "Exchange Effectiveness
Deadline"), (iii) in connection with the foregoing, (A) file all pre-effective
amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as may be necessary in
order to cause it to become effective, (B) file, if applicable, a post-effective
amendment to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A
under the Act and (C) cause all necessary filings, if any, in connection with
the registration and qualification of the Series B Notes to be made under the
Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of
the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement, commence and, within the time period set forth in
Section 3(b) hereof, Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall be
on the appropriate form permitting (i) registration of the Series B Notes to be
offered in exchange for the Series A Notes that are Transfer Restricted
Securities and (ii) resales of Series B Notes by Broker-Dealers that tendered
into the Exchange Offer Series A Notes that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its
own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities

                                       3

<PAGE>

(other than Series A Notes acquired directly from the Company or any of its
Affiliates) as contemplated by Section 3(c) hereof.

     (b) The Company and the Guarantors shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective
continuously, and shall keep the Exchange Offer open for a period of not less
than the minimum period required under applicable federal and state securities
laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer; provided, however, that in no event shall
such period be less than 20 Business Days. The Company and the Guarantors shall
cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws. No securities other than the Series B Notes shall be included
in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company and the Guarantors
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer
to be Consummated within 30 days after the date on which the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission (such 30th day
being the "Exchange Consummation Deadline").

     (c) The Company shall include a "Plan of Distribution" section in the
Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and indicate
therein that any Broker-Dealer who holds Transfer Restricted Securities that
were acquired for the account of such Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making
activities or other trading activities (other than Series A Notes acquired
directly from the Company or any Affiliate of the Company), may exchange such
Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Such "Plan of
Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to
such sales by such Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to
permit such sales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not
name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Transfer Restricted
Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer, except to the extent required by the
Commission as a result of a change in policy, rules or regulations after the
date of this Agreement. See the Shearman & Sterling no-action letter (available
July 2, 1993).

     Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the
meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the
requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Series B
Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company and
Guarantors shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus
delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of
Series B Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company and the Guarantors agree to use
their respective best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and
subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) and Section 6(c) hereof and in
conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies,
rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a
period of one year from the Exchange Consummation Deadline or such shorter
period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto. The Company and the
Guarantors shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such
Prospectus to such Broker-Dealers, promptly upon request at any time during such
period.

SECTION 4. SHELF REGISTRATION

     (a) Shelf Registration. If (i) the Company and the Guarantors are not (A)
required to file the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or (B) permitted to
Consummate the Exchange Offer because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by
applicable law or Commission policy (after the Company and the Guarantors have
complied with the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) hereof) or (ii) if any
Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall notify the Company prior to the
20th Business Days following the Consummation of the Exchange Offer that (A)
such Holder was prohibited by law or Commission policy from participating in the
Exchange Offer or (B) such Holder may not resell the Series B Notes acquired by
it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and the
Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not
appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder or (C) such Holder is a
Broker-Dealer and holds Series A Notes acquired directly from the Company or any
of its Affiliates, then the Company and the Guarantors shall:

     (x) use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed, on or prior to
90 days after the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company determines that
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement cannot be filed as a result of clause
(a)(i) of this Section 4 and (ii) the date on which the Company receives the
notice specified in clause (a)(ii) of this Section 4, (such 90th day after the
earlier date, the "Shelf Filing Deadline"), a shelf registration statement
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act, which may be an amendment to the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), relating to
all Transfer Restricted Securities, and

     (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective on or prior to 180 days after the
Shelf Filing Deadline (such 180th day the "Shelf Effectiveness Deadline").

     If, after the Company has filed an Exchange Offer Registration Statement
that satisfies the requirements of Section 3(a) hereof, the Company is required
to file and make effective a Shelf Registration Statement solely because the
Exchange Offer is not permitted under applicable federal law (i.e., clause
(a)(i) of this Section 4), then the filing of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of clause (x) of this
Section 4; provided that, in such event, the Company shall remain obligated to
meet the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline set forth in clause (y) of this Section 4.

     To the extent necessary to ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement is
available for sales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof
entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a) and the other securities required
to be registered therein pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) hereof, the Company and
the Guarantors shall use their respective best efforts to keep any Shelf
Registration Statement required by this Section 4(a) continuously effective,
supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions
of Section 6(b) and Section (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements
of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the
Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years
(as extended pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) hereof) following the Closing Date, or
such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.

                                       5

<PAGE>

     (b) Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the
Shelf Registration Statement. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may
include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to
the Company in writing, within 20 days after receipt of a request therefor, the
information specified in Item 507 or Item 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable,
of the Act for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. No Holder of Transfer
Restricted Securities shall be entitled to liquidated damages pursuant to
Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such
information. Each selling Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional
information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously
furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.

SECTION 5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

     If (i) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed
with the Commission on or prior to the Exchange Filing Deadline or the Shelf
Filing Deadline, as applicable, (ii) any such Registration Statement has not
been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Exchange
Effectiveness Deadline or the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline, as applicable, (iii)
the Exchange Offer has not been Consummated on or prior to the Exchange
Consummation Deadline or (iv) any Registration Statement required by this
Agreement is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter cease to be
effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without being succeeded
immediately by a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement that
cures such failure and that is itself declared effective immediately (each such
event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a "Registration Default"),
then the Company and the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay to
each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities affected thereby liquidated
damages in an amount equal to $.05 per week per $1,000 in principal amount of
Transfer Restricted Securities held by such Holder for each week or portion
thereof that the Registration Default continues for the first 90-day period
immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default. The amount of
the liquidated damages shall increase by an additional $.05 per week per $1,000
in principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities with respect to each
subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to
a maximum amount of liquidated damages of $.50 per week per $1,000 in principal
amount of Transfer Restricted Securities; provided that the Company and the
Guarantors shall in no event be required to pay liquidated damages for more than
one Registration Default at any given time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, (1) upon filing of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration Statement), in the case
of (i) above, (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration Statement), in the case
of (ii) above, (3) upon Consummation of the Exchange Offer, in the case of (iii)
above, or (4) upon the filing of a post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement or an additional Registration Statement that causes the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration Statement)
to again be declared effective or made usable in the case of (iv) above, the
liquidated damages payable with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities as
a result of such clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), as applicable, shall cease.

                                       6

<PAGE>

     All accrued liquidated damages shall be paid to the Holders entitled
thereto, in the manner provided for the payment of interest in the Indenture, on
each Interest Payment Date, as more fully set forth in the Indenture and the
Notes. Notwithstanding the fact that any securities for which liquidated damages
are due cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities, all obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors to pay liquidated damages with respect to securities
shall survive until such time as such obligations with respect to such
securities shall have been satisfied in full.

SECTION 6. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

     (a) Exchange Offer Registration Statement. In connection with the Exchange
Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall (x) comply with all applicable
provisions of Section 6(c) hereof, (y) use their respective best efforts to
effect such exchange and to permit the resale of Series B Notes by
Broker-Dealers that tendered in the Exchange Offer Series A Notes that such
Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of its market making
activities or other trading activities (other than Series A Notes acquired
directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates) being sold in accordance
with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and (z) comply with
all of the following provisions:

          (i) If, following the date hereof there has been announced a change in
     Commission policy with respect to exchange offers such as the Exchange
     Offer, that in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company raises a
     substantial question as to whether the Exchange Offer is permitted by
     applicable federal law, the Company and the Guarantors hereby agree to seek
     a no-action letter or other favorable decision from the Commission allowing
     the Company and the Guarantors to Consummate an Exchange Offer for such
     Transfer Restricted Securities. The Company and the Guarantors hereby agree
     to pursue the issuance of such a decision to the Commission staff level. In
     connection with the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors hereby agree
     to take all such other actions as may be requested by the Commission or
     otherwise required in connection with the issuance of such decision,
     including without limitation (A) participating in telephonic conferences
     with the Commission, (B) delivering to the Commission staff an analysis
     prepared by counsel to the Company setting forth the legal bases, if any,
     upon which such counsel has concluded that such an Exchange Offer should be
     permitted and (C) diligently pursuing a resolution (which need not be
     favorable) by the Commission staff.

          (ii) As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer, each
     Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (including, without limitation,
     any Holder who is a Broker Dealer) shall furnish, upon the request of the
     Company, prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, a written
     representation to the Company and the Guarantors (which may be contained in
     the letter of transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration
     Statement) to the effect that (A) it is not an Affiliate of the Company,
     (B) it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no
     arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in, a
     distribution of the Series B Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and
     (C) it is acquiring the Series B Notes in its ordinary course of business.
     As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer each Holder using
     the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of the Series B Notes
     shall acknowledge

                                       7

<PAGE>

     and agree that, if the resales are of Series B Notes obtained by such
     Holder in exchange for Series A Notes acquired directly from the Company or
     an Affiliate thereof, it (1) could not, under Commission policy as in
     effect on the date of this Agreement, rely on the position of the
     Commission enunciated in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May
     13, 1988) and Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991), as
     interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2,
     1993, and similar no-action letters (including, if applicable, any
     no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above), and (2) must
     comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
     Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such a
     secondary resale transaction must be covered by an effective registration
     statement containing the selling security holder information required by
     Item 507 or Item 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K.

          (iii) Prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration
     Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall provide a supplemental
     letter to the Commission (A) stating that the Company and the Guarantors
     are registering the Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the
     Commission enunciated in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May
     13, 1988), Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) as
     interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2,
     1993, and, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause
     (i) above, (B) including a representation that neither the Company nor any
     Guarantor has entered into any arrangement or understanding with any Person
     to distribute the Series B Notes to be received in the Exchange Offer and
     that, to the best of the Company's and each Guarantor's information and
     belief, each Holder participating in the Exchange Offer is acquiring the
     Series B Notes in its ordinary course of business and has no arrangement or
     understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution of the
     Series B Notes received in the Exchange Offer and (C) any other undertaking
     or representation required by the Commission as set forth in any no-action
     letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above, if applicable.

     (b) Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall (i) comply with all the
provisions of Section 6(c) hereof and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer
Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or
methods of distribution thereof (as indicated in the information furnished to
the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof), and pursuant thereto the Company
and the Guarantors will prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Act,
which form shall be available for the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities
in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof within
the time periods and otherwise in accordance with the provisions hereof, and

          (ii) issue, upon the request of any Holder or purchaser of Series A
     Notes covered by any Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by this
     Agreement, Series B Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the
     aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes sold pursuant to the Shelf
     Registration Statement and surrendered to the Company for cancellation; the
     Company shall register Series B Notes on the Shelf Registration Statement
     for this purpose and issue the Series B Notes to the purchasers of

                                       8

<PAGE>

     securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement in the names as such
     purchasers shall designate.

     (c) General Provisions. In connection with any Registration Statement and
any related Prospectus required by this Agreement, the Company and the
Guarantors shall:

          (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to keep such
     Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite
     financial statements for the period specified in Section 3 or Section 4 of
     this Agreement, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of any event that would
     cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein
     (A) to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
     material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
     (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted
     Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the Company and
     the Guarantors shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such
     Registration Statement curing such defect, and, if Commission review is
     required, use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such
     amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable.

          (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
     post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may
     be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the
     applicable period set forth in Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, as the case
     may be; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus
     supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under
     the Act, and to comply fully with Rules 424, 430A and 462, as applicable,
     under the Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Act
     with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
     Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the
     intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth
     in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

          (iii) advise each Holder promptly and, if requested by such Holder,
     confirm such advice in writing, (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus
     supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to
     any applicable Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
     thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the
     Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or
     supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating
     thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
     the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Act or of the
     suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the
     Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
     the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes and (D)
     of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any
     statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the
     Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document
     incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of
     any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement in order to make
     the statements therein not misleading, or that requires the making of any
     additions to or changes in the Prospectus in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order
     suspending the

                                       9

<PAGE>

     effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state securities
     commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending
     the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer
     Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company
     and the Guarantors shall use their respective best efforts to obtain the
     withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time;

          (iv) subject to Section 6(c)(i) hereof, if any fact or event
     contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(D) above shall exist or have occurred,
     prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
     Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by
     reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter
     delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the
     Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
     to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
     light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

          (v) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale,
     if any, before filing with the Commission, copies of any Registration
     Statement or any Prospectus included therein or any amendments or
     supplements to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all
     documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such
     Registration Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and
     comment of such Holders in connection with such sale, if any, for a period
     of at least five Business Days, and the Company will not file any such
     Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any
     such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such documents
     incorporated by reference) to which such Holders shall reasonably object
     within five Business Days after the receipt thereof. A Holder shall be
     deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing if such Registration
     Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed
     to be filed, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
     state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
     misleading or fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the Act;

          (vi) promptly prior to the filing of any document that is to be
     incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus,
     provide copies of such document to each Holder in connection with such
     exchange or sale, if any, make the Company's and the Guarantors'
     representatives available for discussion of such document and other
     customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such
     document prior to the filing thereof as such Holders Persons may reasonably
     request;

          (vii) make available, at reasonable times, for inspection by each
     Holder and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders, all
     financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents of the Company
     and the Guarantors and cause the Company's and the Guarantors' officers,
     directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by
     any such Holder, attorney or accountant in connection with such
     Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto subsequent
     to the filing thereof and prior to its effectiveness;

                                       10

<PAGE>

          (viii) if requested by any Holders in connection with such exchange or
     sale, promptly include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus,
     pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such
     information as such Holders may reasonably request to have included
     therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the "Plan
     of Distribution" of the Transfer Restricted Securities; and make all
     required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
     as soon as practicable after the Company is notified of the matters to be
     included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;

          (ix) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale,
     without charge, at least one copy of the Registration Statement, as first
     filed with the Commission, and of each amendment thereto, including all
     documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits (including
     exhibits incorporated therein by reference);

          (x) deliver to each Holder without charge, as many copies of the
     Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or
     supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably may request; the Company and
     the Guarantors hereby consent to the use (in accordance with law) of the
     Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each selling Holder
     in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted
     Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
     thereto;

          (xi) upon the request of any Holder, enter into such agreements
     (including underwriting agreements) and make such representations and
     warranties and take all such other actions in connection therewith in order
     to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted
     Securities pursuant to any applicable Registration Statement contemplated
     by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by any Holder in
     connection with any sale or resale pursuant to any applicable Registration
     Statement. In such connection, the Company and the Guarantors shall:

               (A) upon request of any Holder, furnish (or in the case of
          paragraphs (2) and (3) below, use its best efforts to cause to be
          furnished) to each Holder, upon Consummation of the Exchange Offer or
          upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the
          case may be:

                    (1) a certificate, dated such date, signed on behalf of the
               Company and each Guarantor by (x) the President or any Vice
               President and (y) a principal financial or accounting officer of
               the Company and such Guarantor, confirming, as of the date
               thereof, the matters set forth in Sections 8(a), 8(b), 8(c) and
               8(d) of the Purchase Agreement and such other similar matters as
               such Holders may reasonably request;

                    (2) opinion(s), dated the date of Consummation of the
               Exchange Offer or the date of effectiveness of the Shelf
               Registration Statement, as the case may be, of counsel for the
               Company and the Guarantors covering matters similar to those set
               forth in paragraph (f) of Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement and
               such other matter as such Holder may reasonably request, and in
               any event including a statement to the

                                       11

<PAGE>

               effect that such counsel has participated in conferences with
               officers and other representatives of the Company and the
               Guarantors, representatives of the independent public accountants
               for the Company and the Guarantors and have considered the
               matters required to be stated therein and the statements
               contained therein, although such counsel has not independently
               verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such
               statements; and that such counsel advises that, on the basis of
               the foregoing (relying as to materiality to the extent such
               counsel deems appropriate upon the statements of officers and
               other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors), no
               facts came to such counsel's attention that caused such counsel
               to believe that the applicable Registration Statement, at the
               time such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
               thereto became effective and, in the case of the Exchange Offer
               Registration Statement, as of the date of Consummation of the
               Exchange Offer, contained an untrue statement of a material fact
               or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
               or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
               that the Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement as
               of its date and, in the case of the opinion dated the date of
               Consummation of the Exchange Offer, as of the date of
               Consummation, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
               omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
               statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
               they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the foregoing,
               such counsel may state further that such counsel assumes no
               responsibility for, and has not independently verified, the
               accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements,
               notes and schedules and other financial data included in any
               Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement or the
               related Prospectus; and

                    (3) customary comfort letters, dated the date of
               Consummation of the Exchange Offer, or as of the date of
               effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case
               may be, from the Company's independent accountants, in the
               customary form and covering matters of the type customarily
               covered in comfort letters to underwriters in connection with
               underwritten offerings, and affirming the matters set forth in
               the comfort letters delivered pursuant to Section 8(g) of the
               Purchase Agreement; and

               (B) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be
          reasonably requested by the selling Holders to evidence compliance
          with the matters covered in clause (A) above and with any customary
          conditions contained in the any agreement entered into by the Company
          and the Guarantors pursuant to this clause (xi);

          (xii) prior to any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities,
     cooperate with the selling Holders and their counsel in connection with the
     registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under
     the securities or Blue Sky laws of

                                       12

<PAGE>

     such jurisdictions as the selling Holders may request and do any and all
     other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in
     such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the
     applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that neither the
     Company nor any Guarantor shall be required to register or qualify as a
     foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to take any action
     that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation,
     other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration
     Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject;

          (xiii) in connection with any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities
     that will result in such securities no longer being Transfer Restricted
     Securities, cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation
     and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to
     be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and to register such
     Transfer Restricted Securities in such denominations and such names as the
     selling Holders may request at least two Business Days prior to such sale
     of Transfer Restricted Securities;

          (xiv) use their respective best efforts to cause the disposition of
     the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration Statement to
     be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
     authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof to
     consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities, subject
     to the proviso contained in clause (xii) above;

          (xv) provide a CUSIP number for all Transfer Restricted Securities not
     later than the effective date of a Registration Statement covering such
     Transfer Restricted Securities and provide the Trustee under the Indenture
     with printed certificates for the Transfer Restricted Securities which are
     in a form eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust Company;

          (xvi) otherwise use their respective best efforts to comply with all
     applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally
     available to its security holders with regard to any applicable
     Registration Statement, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings
     statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 (which need not be audited)
     covering a twelve-month period beginning after the effective date of the
     Registration Statement (as such term is defined in paragraph (c) of Rule
     158 under the Act);

          (xvii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not later
     than the effective date of the first Registration Statement required by
     this Agreement and, in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and
     the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for
     such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA;
     and execute and use its best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all
     documents that may be required to effect such changes and all other forms
     and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such
     Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner; and

                                       13

<PAGE>

          (xviii) provide promptly to each Holder, upon request, each document
     filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or
     Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     (d) Restrictions on Holders. Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a
Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of the notice referred to in
Section 6(c)(iii)(C) hereof or any notice from the Company of the existence of
any fact of the kind described in Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof (in each case, a
"Suspension Notice"), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement
until (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(iv) hereof, or (ii) such Holder is
advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (in each case, the "Recommencement
Date"). Each Holder receiving a Suspension Notice hereby agrees that it will
either (i) destroy any Prospectuses, other than permanent file copies, then in
such Holder's possession which have been replaced by the Company with more
recently dated Prospectuses or (ii) deliver to the Company (at the Company's
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's
possession of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that
was current at the time of receipt of the Suspension Notice. The time period
regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section
3 or Section 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by a number of days
equal to the number of days in the period from and including the date of
delivery of the Suspension Notice to the date of delivery of the Recommencement
Date.

SECTION 7. REGISTRATION EXPENSES

     (a) All expenses incident to the Company's and the Guarantors' performance
of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of
whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including without
limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses; (ii) all fees and
expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities
laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates for the
Series B Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of Prospectuses),
messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Company and the Guarantors; (v) all application and filing
fees in connection with listing the Series B Notes on a national securities
exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and
(vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of
the Company and the Guarantors (including the expenses of any special audit and
comfort letters required by or incident to such performance).

     The Company will, in any event, bear its and the Guarantors' internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of
any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special
experts, retained by the Company or the Guarantors.

     (b) In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement required by this
Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors will reimburse the Initial Purchasers
and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who are tendering Series A
Notes into in the Exchange Offer

                                       14

<PAGE>

and/or selling or reselling Series A Notes or Series B Notes pursuant to the
"Plan of Distribution" contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or
the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and
disbursements of not more than one counsel, who shall be Latham & Watkins,
unless another firm shall be chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration
Statement is being prepared.

SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION

     (a) The Company and the Guarantors agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its directors, officers and each
Person, if any, who controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, (including without limitation, any
legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any matter, including any action that could give rise to any such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments) caused by any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) provided by the Company to any Holder or any prospective purchaser of
Series B Notes or registered Series A Notes, or caused by any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by an untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is based upon
information relating to any Holder furnished in writing to the Company by any
such Holder.

     (b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted agrees, severally and not jointly,
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, and their
respective directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the
Company, or the Guarantors to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
the Company and the Guarantors set forth in section (a) above, but only with
reference to information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the
Company by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In no
event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such
Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which
the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer
Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the
amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the
amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any Person
who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

     (c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) hereof
(the "indemnified party"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the
person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying person") in
writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred
(except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to both

                                       15

<PAGE>

Sections 8(a) and 8(b) hereof, a Holder shall not be required to assume the
defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate
counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder).
Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by
the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume
the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action
on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party
shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for
all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the
Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof,
and by the Company and Guarantors, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant
to Section 8(b) hereof. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless
the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected
with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the
settlement is entered into more than twenty business days after the indemnifying
party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement
for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses
are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such
settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such
reimbursement request. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened
action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party
and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the
indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes
an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims
that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not
include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to
act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

     (d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8
is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale
of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
8(d)(i) hereof is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause
8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on
the one hand, and of the

                                       16

<PAGE>

Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company
and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such
Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or
defending any action or claim.

     The Company, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any
action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its
directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be
required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer
Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the
amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the
amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

     (a) Remedies. The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that any
failure by the Company and/or the Guarantors to comply with their respective
obligations under Section 3 and Section 4 hereof may result in material
irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is
no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for
such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial
Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to
specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations under Section
3 and Section 4 hereof. The Company and the Guarantors further agree to waive
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

     (b) No Inconsistent Agreements. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will,
on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to
its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in
this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. Neither the
Company nor any Guarantor has previously entered into any agreement granting any
registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person. The rights
granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not
inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's and the
Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.

     (c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from
the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5
hereof and this Section 10(c)(i), the Company has obtained the written consent
of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the
case of all other provisions hereof, the Company has obtained the written
consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer
Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the
Company or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent
to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights
of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to
the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights
of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered
pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of
the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to
such Exchange Offer.

     (d) Third Party Beneficiary. The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries
to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the Guarantors, on the
one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the
right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may deem such
enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of
Holders hereunder.

     (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted
hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail
(registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, telecopier, or air

     Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be

     (f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including
without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent
Holders; provided, that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment,
transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of
the terms hereof or of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any
transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities in any
manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted
Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by
taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such Person shall be
conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions on resale set
forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Purchase Agreement, and such
Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.

     (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

     (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of

contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein
with respect to the registration rights granted with respect to the Transfer
Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
