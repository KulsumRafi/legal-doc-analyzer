             (a) The expiration of ten years from the date the Option was
granted; or

             (b) The expiration of three months from the date of the Optionee's
Termination of Directorship for any reason other than such Optionee's death,

Section 3.4 - Acceleration of Exercisability

             (a) In the event of a Change in Control, provided the Option has

Change in Control, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1.

             (b) In the event of a Corporate Transaction, provided the Option

shall become fully vested and exercisable as to all shares covered thereby
immediately prior to the effective date of such Corporate Transaction,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1; provided, however, that
this acceleration of exercisability shall not take place if, in connection with
such Corporate Transaction, provision is made for an assumption of this Option
or a substitution therefor of a new option by a successor or survivor
corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation.

             (c) To the extent consistent with the requirements of Rule 16b-3,

conditions as it, in its absolute discretion, deems appropriate in connection
with such acceleration of exercisability, including, but not by way of
limitation, provisions to ensure that any such acceleration and resulting
exercise shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the contemplated Change
in Control or Corporate Transaction, and determinations regarding whether
provisions for assumption or substitution have been made as defined in
subsection (b) above.

                               EXERCISE OF OPTION

Section 4.1 - Person Eligible to Exercise

             During the lifetime of the Optionee, only the Optionee may exercise
the Option or any portion thereof, unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a
QDRO. After the death of the Optionee, any exercisable portion of the Option
may, prior to the time when such portion becomes unexercisable under Section
3.3, be exercised by his personal representative or by any person empowered to
do so under the deceased Optionee's will or under the then applicable laws of
descent and distribution.

Section 4.2 - Partial Exercise

             Any exercisable portion of the Option or the entire Option, if then
wholly exercisable, may be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to
the time when the Option or portion thereof becomes unexercisable under Section
3.3; provided, however, that each partial exercise shall be for whole shares
only.

Section 4.3 - Manner of Exercise

             The Option, or any exercisable portion thereof, may be exercised
solely by delivery to the Secretary of the Company (the "Secretary") or his
office of all of the following prior to the time when the Option or such portion
becomes unexercisable under Section 3.3:

             (a) A written notice complying with the applicable rules
established by the Board stating that the Option, or a portion thereof, is
exercised. The notice shall be signed by the Optionee or other person then
entitled to exercise the Option or such portion; and

             (b) Full cash payment to the Secretary for the shares with respect
to which the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised. However, the Board, may
in its discretion (i) allow a delay in payment up to 30 days from the date the
Option, or portion thereof, is exercised; (ii) allow payment, in whole or in
part, through the delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee, duly
endorsed for transfer to the Company with a Fair Market Value on the date of
delivery equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option or exercised
portion thereof; (iii) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the surrender
of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of the Option having a
Fair Market Value on the date of Option exercise equal to the aggregate exercise
price of the Option or exercised portion thereof; (iv) allow payment, in whole
or in part, through the delivery of property of any kind which constitutes good
and valuable consideration; (v) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the
delivery of a full recourse promissory note bearing interest (at no less than
such rate as shall then preclude the imputation of interest under the Code) and
payable upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Board; (vi) allow payment,
in whole or in part, through the delivery of a notice that the Optionee has
placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to shares of Common Stock
then issuable upon exercise of the Option, and that the broker has been directed
to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in
satisfaction of the Option exercise price; or (vii) allow payment through any
combination of the consideration provided in the foregoing subparagraphs (ii),
(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi). In the case of a promissory note, the Board may also
prescribe the form of such note and the security to be given for such note. The
Option may not be exercised, however, by delivery of a promissory note or by a
loan from the Company when or where such loan or other extension of credit is
prohibited by law; and

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

             (c) Such representations and documents as the Board, in its
absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with all
applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any other
federal or state securities laws or regulations. The Board may, in its absolute
discretion, also take whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to effect
such compliance, including, without limitation, placing legends on share
certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars; and

             (d) Full payment to the Company of all amounts which, under
federal, state or local tax law, it is required to withhold upon exercise of the
Option; provided that, with the consent of the Board, all or part of such
payment may be made with (i) shares of the Company's Common Stock owned by the
Optionee, duly endorsed for transfer, with a Fair Market Value equal to the sums
required to be withheld, or (ii) shares of the Company's Common Stock issuable
to the Optionee upon exercise of the Option with a Fair Market Value equal to
the sums required to be withheld; provided, further, that the number of shares
of Common Stock which may be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting,
exercise or payment of the Option (or which may be repurchased from the Optionee
within six months after such shares of Common Stock were acquired from the
Company by the Optionee) in order to satisfy the Optionee's federal and state
income and payroll tax liabilities with respect to the issuance, vesting,
exercise or payment of the Option shall be limited to the number of shares which
have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the
aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the minimum statutory withholding
rates for federal and state tax income and payroll tax purposes that are
applicable to such supplemental taxable income; and

             (e) In the event the Option or portion shall be exercised pursuant
to Section 4.1 by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate
proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option.

Section 4.4 - Conditions to Issuance of Stock Certificates

             The shares of stock deliverable upon the exercise of the Option, or
any portion thereof, may be either previously authorized but unissued shares or
issued shares which have then been reacquired by the Company. Such shares shall
be fully paid and nonassessable. The Company shall not be required to issue or
deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of stock purchased upon the
exercise of the Option or portion thereof prior to fulfillment of all of the
following conditions:

             (a) The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges
on which such class of stock is then listed; and

             (b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of
such shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission or of any other governmental regulatory
body, which the Board shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or
advisable; and

             (c) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state
or federal governmental agency which the Board shall, in its absolute
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and

             (d) The receipt by the Company of full payment for such shares,
including payment of any applicable withholding tax; and

             (e) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the
exercise of the Option as the Board may from time to time establish for reasons
of administrative convenience.
