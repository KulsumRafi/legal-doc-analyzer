<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.1</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has established the Infinity
Broadcasting Corporation Stock Plan for Directors, as such plan may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), for those directors of the Company who are neither officers (other than
non-executive officers) nor employees of the Company. The Plan provides, among other things, for the payment of Director compensation, including Board Chairman compensation and
compensation for other special services as a Director, if any, in the form of Stock Options and Restricted Stock and the opportunity for the Directors to defer receipt of all or a part of their cash
compensation. Unless otherwise provided for herein, the term Company includes Infinity Broadcasting Corporation and its subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.2</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposes.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of the Plan are to encourage the Directors to own shares of the Company's stock and thereby to
align their interests more closely with the interests of the other shareholders of the Company, to encourage the highest level of Director performance, and to provide a financial incentive that will
help attract and retain the most qualified Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.3</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director Compensation.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors will not be compensated for their services as directors for 1998. Thereafter, Directors
will receive such compensation in such form, which may include cash, equity or any combination thereof, as the Board or the Committee may from time to time determine. For 1999, unless and until the
Board or the Committee determines otherwise, Directors will receive an annual director's fee of $30,000 in cash (which will not be eligible for deferral under the Plan) and a grant of stock options
for 4,500 shares of Stock pursuant to Section&nbsp;6. Beginning in calendar year 2000, unless the Board or the Committee determines otherwise, Directors will receive an annual director's fee of
$60,000 payable as follows: $30,000 in cash and a grant of $30,000 in Stock Options pursuant to Section&nbsp;6. Such fee may be prorated for Directors serving for less than the full year, but only
to the extent, if any, so determined by the Company. Directors will also be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings. </FONT></P>
