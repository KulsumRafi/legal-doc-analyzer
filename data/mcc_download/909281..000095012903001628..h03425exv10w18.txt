                  judgment and discretion when (i) the amount involved is less

                  Policy Committee; (ii) no injunctive or similar relief is
                  sought; and (iii) no criminal sanction is sought; otherwise,

                  Committee, and any settlement or defense thereof shall be
                  controlled by the Partnership Policy Committee.

SECTION 3.05 - INSURANCE

         (a)      At all times during the term of this Agreement, Operator shall
                  carry and maintain in force the insurance coverages set forth
                  in Exhibit "B" hereto. Operator shall require that all of its
                  contractors, subcontractors or consultants engaged in any
                  aspect of the operations hereunder or exposed to the risk of
                  any of the operations hereunder carry and maintain insurance
                  coverages commensurate with risks involved in accordance with
                  Operator's established operating practices.

         (b)      The premiums for insurance coverages for which Operator is
                  responsible under this section shall be a reimbursable cost
                  pursuant to Section 5.01(b).

         (c)      Operator may carry and maintain such other insurance for its
                  own account as it may deem necessary, but in the event other
                  insurance is carried, Operator agrees to waive and agrees to
                  have its insurers waive any rights of subrogation they may
                  have against Viking, or its affiliates, parent of any of them,
                  and/or their directors, officers, employees, servants or
                  agents.

         (d)      With respect to claims and losses for damage, injury or
                  destruction of property which is a part of the Line, which
                  property is covered by insurance other than insurance provided
                  for in Section 3.05(a), it is agreed that neither Operator nor
                  Viking shall have any rights of recovery against one another,
                  nor against the affiliates of each, nor the insurers of any of
                  them, and their rights of recovery are mutually waived. All
                  such policies of insurance purchased to cover the Line or any
                  part thereof, or the operation (in any respect) of the Line or
                  any part thereof, or any gas transported or handled therein,
                  shall be endorsed properly to effectuate this waiver of
                  recovery.

         Operator shall employ or retain and have supervision over the persons
(including consultants and professional service providers or other





                                       6
<PAGE>
organizations) required by Operator to perform its duties and responsibilities
hereunder in an efficient and economically prudent manner. Operator shall pay
all reasonable expenses in connection therewith, including compensation,
salaries, wages and overhead and administrative expense incurred by Operator's
parent and affiliates, and, if applicable, social security taxes, workers'
compensation insurance, retirement and insurance benefits and other such
expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2 of the Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership of Northern Border Partners, L.P. dated as of
October 1, 1993, the compensation for Operator's employees shall be determined
by Operator. All authorized expenses pursuant to this Section shall be
reimbursed to Operator by Viking as provided in the Accounting Procedure.


SECTION 4.02 - STANDARDS FOR EMPLOYEES

         All employees, workmen, foremen and supervisors ("employees") engaged
or directed by Operator to perform Operator's obligations under this Agreement
shall be duly qualified and experienced to perform such obligations. Operator
shall at all times enforce strict discipline and maintain good order among such
employees, and shall require such employees to comply with all relevant laws,
statutes, ordinances, safety codes, regulations and rules applicable to the
operation of the Line.


SECTION 4.03 - CONSULTANTS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

         The provisions of Sections 4.02 shall be applicable to any contractors,
consultants and/or subcontractors retained in connection herewith.


                                    ARTICLE V

                   FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND BILLING PRACTICES


SECTION 5.01 - ACCOUNTING AND COMPENSATION

         (a)      Operator shall keep a full and complete account of all costs,
                  expenses and expenditures incurred by it in connection with
                  its obligations hereunder in the manner set forth in the
                  Accounting Procedure.

         (b)      Operator shall be reimbursed by Viking for all reasonable and
                  proper costs, expenses and expenditures paid by it for Viking
                  at the rate and in the manner set forth in the Accounting
                  Procedure; provided, however, that costs incurred by the
                  Operator under





                                       7
<PAGE>
                  Section 3.03 shall not be reimbursed by Viking. It is the
                  intent of the parties that Operator shall carry out its
                  services hereunder on a fully reimbursed basis without profit
                  or loss. To the extent that a deviation from this standard
                  occurs, appropriate adjustments will promptly be made.

         (c)      To the extent that Operator enters into activities other than
                  the discharge of its responsibilities as Operator, Operator
                  shall separately account for such costs, expenses and
                  expenditures and Viking shall not be billed for such costs,
                  expenses, or expenditures.


SECTION 5.02 - BUDGETS

         On or before each November 1, Operator shall prepare and submit for
approval by the Partnership Policy Committee an estimate of capital expenditures
and operating income and expenses which Operator anticipates for the next
calendar year. Except as the Partnership Policy Committee may otherwise direct,
the budget approved by the Partnership Policy Committee and then in effect shall
constitute authorization of Operator to incur the expenditures contained in such
budget.


SECTION 5.03 - DISPUTED CHARGES

         Viking may, within the time provided in the Accounting Procedure, take
written exception to any bill or statement rendered by Operator for any
expenditure or any part thereof, on the ground that the same was not a
reasonable, authorized, and proper cost incurred by Operator in connection with
the operation, maintenance, upkeep or repair of the Line. Viking shall
nevertheless pay in full when due the amount of all statements submitted by
Operator. Such payment shall not be deemed a waiver of the right of Viking to
recoup any contested portion of any bill or statement. However, if the amount as
to which such written exception is taken or any part thereof is ultimately
determined by Viking not to be a reasonable, authorized, and proper expense
incurred by Operator in connection with the operation, maintenance, upkeep or
repair of the Line, such amount or portion thereof (as the case may be) shall be
refunded by Operator to Viking together with interest thereon at an annual rate
(which in no event shall be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable
law) equal to the prime rate charged by Citibank of New York, or its successor
entity, from time to time to responsible commercial and





                                       8
<PAGE>
industrial borrowers during the period from the date of payment by Viking to the
date of refund by Operator.


SECTION 5.04 - RATE REVIEWS

         Operator shall review from time-to-time the rates and fees charged for
transportation services and recommend to Viking revision in such rates and fees
as necessary to reflect increased or decreased costs or other changes in the
conditions of service in order to assure that all costs are reflected in the
tariffs of Viking.


SECTION 5.05 - AUDIT

         Viking or its designated representatives, after fifteen (15) days'
notice in writing to Operator, shall have the right during normal business hours
to audit, at its own expense, all books and records of Operator as well as the
relevant books of account of Operator's contractors relating to the construction
and operation of the Line. Such audits shall not be commenced more often than
twice each calendar year. Viking shall have two (2) years after the close of a
calendar year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such calendar
year. Absent fraud or intentional concealment or misrepresentation by Operator
or its employees, and except for any adjustments which may arise from FERC
compliance audits, Operator shall neither be required nor permitted to adjust
any item unless a claim therefor is presented or adjustment is initiated within
two (2) years after the close of the calendar year in which the statement
therefor is rendered, and in the absence of such timely claims or adjustments,
the bills and statements rendered shall be conclusively established as correct;
provided, however, this shall not prevent adjustment resulting from physical
inventory of the Line.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                             INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR


SECTION 6.01 - INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

         (a)      In performing services pursuant to this Agreement, Operator
                  shall be an independent contractor and not an employee, agent
                  or servant of Viking and this Agreement does not create any
                  partnership or joint venture between Viking and the Operator.





                                       9

         (b)      Operator shall comply with all relevant laws, statutes,
                  ordinances, safety codes, regulations and rules applicable to
                  the operation of the Line.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                              INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY


SECTION 7.01 - INVENTIONS AND COPYRIGHTS

         Any inventions, whether patentable or not, developed or invented or
copyrightable material, developed by Operator or its employees during the
performance of services under this Agreement shall, unless otherwise directed,
be assigned to Viking, which shall have the exclusive right to the exploitation
thereof.


SECTION 7.02 - CONFIDENTIALITY

         Because the information and knowledge gained during the performance of
services hereunder may consist of valuable proprietary information, the misuse
or disclosure of which could cause substantial damage to Viking, any and all
information obtained by Operator in performance of its obligations hereunder
shall be held in strict confidence by Operator, its employees or agents except
as needed to comply with the purposes of this Agreement. Any contracts entered
into by Operator related to its obligations under this Agreement shall contain a
provision which similarly restricts the use and disclosure of such information.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                      TERM

continue for a term of five (5) years, and thereafter on a year-to-year basis
unless terminated on six (6) months prior written notice by either party hereto.


SECTION 8.02 - UPON TERMINATION

         Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party from
paying amounts of money due hereunder which were due prior to or become due
after or as a result of such termination.

SECTION 9.06 - GOVERNMENTAL REPORTS

prescribed by the FERC and any other commission or governmental agency having

SECTION 9.07 - INSPECTION OF FACILITIES AND RECORDS

         Each member of the Partnership Policy Committee shall have the right at
all reasonable times during usual business hours to inspect the facilities of
Viking and to examine and make copies of the books of account and other records
of Viking. Such right may be exercised through any agent or employee of such

                       LAW OF THE CONTRACT AND ARBITRATION


SECTION 10.01 - LAW OF THE CONTRACT

         This Agreement and all other agreements relating thereto shall be
construed and interpreted under the laws of the State of Nebraska.


SECTION 10.02 - ARBITRATION

         (a)      In the event that the parties are unable to agree on any of
                  the matters set forth herein, except as provided in Section
                  5.03, either Viking or Operator may upon written notice call
                  for submission of such matter to arbitration. The party
                  requesting arbitration shall set forth in such notice in
                  adequate detail the issues to be arbitrated, and within ten
                  (10) days from the receipt of such notice, the other party may
                  set forth in adequate detail additional related issues to be
                  arbitrated. If arbitration is





                                       12
<PAGE>
                  invoked by either party, the decision of the arbitrators shall
                  be final and binding upon both parties.

         (b)      Such binding arbitration shall be conducted by a person or
                  entity knowledgeable and experienced in pipeline operations
                  matters. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon
                  such person or entity, they shall then each select a person or
                  entity having the qualifications set forth above, and such
                  persons or entities selected shall mutually agree upon a
                  similarly qualified third person or entity to complete the
                  arbitration panel. In the event that the persons selected by
                  the parties are unable to agree on a third member of the panel
                  within sixty (60) days after their selection, such person
                  shall be designated by the American Arbitration Association or
                  such other person the parties mutually agree upon. Upon final
                  selection of the entire panel, such panel shall, as
                  expeditiously as possible, render a decision on the matter
                  submitted for arbitration.

         (c)      Upon the determination of any such dispute, the arbitrators
                  shall bill the costs attributable to such binding arbitration
                  to the party whose position they determine is farthest away
                  from the actual decision rendered; provided, however, that the
                  arbitrators shall be empowered to apportion such costs between
                  the parties if they deem it appropriate.

         (d)      It is the intent of the parties that the matters agreed upon
                  to be arbitrated be decided as set forth herein and they shall
                  not seek to have this Article X rendered unenforceable or to
                  have such matter decided in any other way.

         In the event that either Viking or Operator is rendered unable, by
reason of an event of force majeure, to perform, wholly or in part, any
obligation or commitment set forth in this contract, then upon such party's
giving notice and full particulars of such event as soon as practicable after
the occurrence thereof, the obligations of both parties, except for unpaid





                                       13

financial obligations arising prior to such event of force majeure, shall be

         Neither Operator nor Viking shall be entitled to the benefit of the
provisions of Section 11.01 under the following circumstances:

         (a)      To the extent that the failure was caused by the party
                  claiming suspension having failed to remedy the condition by
                  taking all reasonable acts, short of litigation, if such
                  remedy requires litigation, and having failed to resume
                  performance of such commitments or obligations with reasonable
                  dispatch;

         (b)      If the failure was caused by lack of funds, or with respect to
                  the payment of any amount or amounts then due hereunder;

         (c)      To the extent that the failure was caused or contributed to by
                  the negligence of Operator or the Partnership and such
                  negligence shall be the cause of such failure.

SECTION 11.04 - RESUMPTION OF NORMAL PERFORMANCE

hereunder, such events shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch to insure
resumption of normal performance.


SECTION 11.05 - STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS

         Settlement of strikes and lockouts shall be entirely within the
discretion of the party affected, and the requirement in Section 11.04 that any

require the settlement of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the
persons or entities directly or indirectly involved in such strikes or lockouts
when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the party having such
difficulty.


                                   ARTICLE XII

                                    ARTICLE I

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS


1.01     STATEMENTS AND BILLINGS. Operator may bill Viking on the first day of
         each month for the estimated costs and expenses for the month and any
         adjustment which may be necessary to correct prior estimated billings
         to actual. Such bills will be summarized by appropriate classifications
         indicative of the nature thereof.

1.02     PAYMENT BY VIKING. Viking shall pay all bills presented in the
         Operating Agreement on or before the 15th day after the billing date.
         If payment is not made within such time, the unpaid balance shall bear
         interest until paid at a rate (which in no event shall be higher than
         the maximum rate or rates permitted by applicable law) equal to the
         prime rate charged by the Citibank of New York, or its successor
         entity, from time to time to responsible commercial and industrial
         borrowers; provided, however, that if employees of Operator are
         responsible for writing Viking's checks and Viking has sufficient funds
         to make payment, no interest charge shall be imposed for late payment.
         Payment by or on behalf of Viking shall not be deemed a waiver of the
         right to recoup any amount in question.

1.03     ADJUSTMENTS. Except for any adjustments which may arise from FERC
         Compliance Audits, payment of any such bills shall not prejudice the
         right of Viking to protest or question the correctness thereof;
         provided however, all bills and statements rendered to Viking by
         Operator during any calendar year shall conclusively be presumed to be
         true and correct after 24 months following the end of any such calendar
         year, unless




                                      A-1
<PAGE>
         prior to the end of said 24 month period Viking takes written exception
         thereto and makes claim on Operator for adjustment; provided, however,
         this shall not prevent adjustment resulting from physical inventory of
         the Line. No adjustment favorable to Operator shall be made unless it
         is made within the same prescribed period.

1.04     FINANCIAL RECORDS. Operator shall maintain accurate books and records
         in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Uniform
         System of Accounts for Class A and B natural gas companies or any
         successor system thereto covering all of Operator's actions under this
         Operating Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE II

                      CAPITAL ITEMS AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS


         Except for items included in a previously approved budget, prior to the
acquisition of any property, real or personal, costing more than a ceiling
amount to be established by the Partnership Policy Committee in the name or on
behalf of Viking which under the accounting rules and regulations, if any, at
the time prescribed by the regulatory body or bodies under the jurisdiction of
which Viking is at the time operating, might be capitalized, Operator shall
prepare and submit to Viking a forecast of the cost of all such property. Upon
approval of such forecast by Viking, Operator shall have authority to purchase
such property in Viking's name or in Operator's name for the benefit of Viking
without further approval or action by Viking. To the extent Operator owns
property necessary or desirable for the operation and maintenance of the Line
which (i) under the accounting rules and regulations, if any, at the time
prescribed by the regulatory body or bodies under the jurisdiction of which
Viking is at the time operating, might be capitalized, (ii) Operator in its sole
discretion is willing to transfer for consideration to Viking, and (iii) can be
transferred by Operator to Viking free and clear of all prior liens and
encumbrances, Operator, if approved by Viking, may so transfer such property to
Viking and charge Viking the net book value thereof as reflected on the books of
Operator on the date of transfer.
