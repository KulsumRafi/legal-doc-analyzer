STOCKBUILDER PLAN</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the StockBuilder Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to attract and retain
employees of outstanding ability by making available to them a convenient means
of acquiring ownership of the $0.01 par value common stock (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;)
of American Management Systems, Incorporated (the &#147;Company&#148;). The Company
believes that stock ownership by its employees and employees of its wholly
owned participating subsidiaries will encourage greater employee dedication to
the Company&#146;s growth, development and success.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Plan is entirely voluntary. There is no guarantee
under the Plan against loss because of fluctuations in the market price of the
Common Stock.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee of the Company or of a participating wholly owned subsidiary
who has attained the age of majority (18&nbsp;years of age in most cases) shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan, except directors and officers who, in the
Company&#146;s sole judgment, are determined to be subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; provided, however, that an
individual who has previously participated in the Plan and whose participation
in the Plan has terminated may not participate in the Plan again until the next
open enrollment period. (See Section&nbsp;4, &#147;Participation-Payroll Deductions&#148;,
for information about open enrollment periods.) Both full-time and part-time
employees shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, any officer of the Company shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan even if such officer is subject to Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and no &#147;Five Percent Stockholder&#148;
shall be permitted to participate in the Plan. A &#147;Five Percent Stockholder&#148;
shall mean a person who, taking into account any stock in the Company that may
be purchased on the next purchase date, owns stock possessing five percent (5%)
or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of
that person&#146;s employer corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation.

Section&nbsp;423(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each eligible individual may become a participant in the Plan (a
&#147;Participant&#148;) by filing with AMS Benefits Office, 4050 Legato Road, 4th Floor,
Fairfax, Virginia 22033 (&#147;Benefits Office&#148;), or with the payroll office (the
&#147;Payroll Office&#148;) of the participating wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
for which the individual works, an enrollment form and such other forms as are
requested by the Company, the Recordskeeper or the Broker. (See Section&nbsp;8 for
the definition of the term &#147;Broker&#148; and Section&nbsp;20 for the definition of the
term &#147;Recordskeeper&#148;). Contracts between the Company or any participating
subsidiary and the Recordskeeper or Broker, as the case may be, shall specify
the forms required by the Recordskeeper and/or Broker. The employee&#146;s
participation in the Plan will begin as soon as practicable after the necessary
forms are received by the Benefits Office or the appropriate Payroll Office.
Appropriate enrollment forms for these purposes shall be provided by the
Company.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTICIPATION-PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Participant contributions under the Plan shall be made only through
payroll deductions. Each Participant shall specify in the enrollment form the
amount to be withheld from his or her earnings. The Participant shall
authorize his or her employer to withhold the authorized amount from the
Participant&#146;s salary or wages in each payroll period thereafter until the
Participant&#146;s participation in the Plan is terminated or until the amount of
such deduction shall be changed or suspended as provided below.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll deductions shall be made in either a fixed dollar amount or as a
percent of qualified gross earnings for the relevant pay period, depending upon
the currency in which the Participant is paid. For Participants who are paid
in U.S. or Canadian dollars, payroll deductions must be made as a percent of
qualified gross earnings. For Participants who are
paid in currency other than U.S. or Canadian dollars, or in any combination of
U.S. dollars and another currency, payroll deductions must be made as a fixed
dollar amount.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deductions from Participants who are paid in currency other than U.S. or
Canadian dollars, or in any combination of U.S. dollars and other currency, are
converted to U.S. dollars for purchasing purposes. The rate of conversion is
based on the average of the exchange rates in effect on the last five business
days of the month prior to the month in which the deduction is made. The
Company will determine the exchange rate in its sole discretion.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fixed dollar deduction method is employed, the amount deducted must
be not less than U.S. $5 per payroll period and not greater than the larger of
(i)&nbsp;10% of the Participant&#146;s average qualified gross earnings per payroll
period for the prior year, and (ii)&nbsp;10% of the Participant&#146;s regular salary per
payroll period for the current year plus 1/24th of the sales commissions to be
received by the Participant from the Participant&#146;s employer in the current
year.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the percentage deduction method is employed, the percentage may not be
less than 1%, nor more than 10% (in .1% increments), of qualified gross
earnings for the payroll period.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified gross earnings shall be limited to regular salary, overtime,
shift differential payments, and sales commissions. Thus, qualified gross
earnings excludes all other forms of cash and non-cash compensation, such as
travel bonuses, performance bonuses, incentive compensation, special bonuses in
lieu of incentive compensation, taxable moving and relocation advances and
reimbursements, and payments in lieu of unused leave.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Participant&#146;s contributions for the year would exceed 10% of his or
her qualified gross earnings, the Company will disallow contributions in
payroll periods to the extent necessary to lower the total annual contribution
to 10% of the Participant&#146;s qualified gross earnings.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant may increase or decrease the amount of payroll deductions,
only during the two annual open enrollment periods which normally occur within
six months of each
other. A Participant may cease payroll deductions at any time, but
re-enrollment may only occur during the two annual open enrollment periods.
Each such change shall be made by filing an

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shares of Common Stock purchased by the Broker from the Company pursuant
to Section&nbsp;7 of the Plan shall be from the Company&#146;s treasury stock. The
purchase price for each share of Common Stock shall be equal to (A)&nbsp;the Fair
Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the purchase date, discounted by
(B)&nbsp;fifteen percent (15%). Fair Market Value for purposes of this Section&nbsp;5
shall mean the closing bid price of the Common Stock quoted over the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) in the
national market for the purchase date, or if there is no trade on such date,
the closing bid price on the last preceding date upon which such Common Stock
was traded. In the event that the Common Stock is not traded over NASDAQ, Fair
Market Value shall be defined as the closing bid price of a share of Common
Stock published in the National Daily Stock Quotation Summary on the purchase
date, or if there are no quotations published on such date, the closing bid
price on the last preceding date upon which such Common Stock was quoted. In
the event that the Common Stock is listed upon an established stock exchange or
exchanges, Fair Market Value shall be deemed to be the highest closing price of
the Common Stock on such stock exchange or exchanges on the purchase date, or
if no sale of the Common Stock shall have been made on any exchange on that
date, then the next preceding day on which there was a sale of such stock. In
the event that Fair Market Value cannot be determined under the foregoing
sentences, Fair Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All such amounts accumulated shall be transmitted by the Company to the

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of funds from the Company pursuant to the Plan, the Broker
shall, as promptly as practicable, purchase from the Company as many whole
shares of Common Stock as the aggregate of such funds will permit at such
purchase price as is determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;5 of the Plan.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BROKER</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall have the power to designate the broker that will make
purchases of Common Stock for the benefit of employees participating in the
Plan (the &#147;Broker&#148;). The Company shall not be required to hire one Broker to
provide all brokerage services under the Plan; provided, that, if more than one
Broker is hired, the services contracts with each Broker shall specify the
Participants to or for whom the Broker shall provide services. The Broker may
open and maintain individual accounts in the names of the Participants, such
accounts being based in the U.S. or Canada as appropriate; notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company, in its discretion, may instead instruct the Broker to
establish an account in the name of the Company. The services contract with
the Broker shall specify whether individual accounts are to be opened and
maintained in the names of Participants or whether an account shall be opened
in the name of the Company. The Company shall not be required to use the same
method of holding Common Stock (i.e., the use of a Company account or
individual accounts) for all Participants. If an individual account is
established with respect to a Participant, the relationship between the Broker
and the Participant would be the customary relationship of a broker and its
client and the Company would have no responsibility in this
regard except for payroll deductions and remittance of such funds to the
Broker. If a Company account is established, the Company shall act as a
fiduciary with respect to Common Stock held in the account; provided, that, the
Company shall have no fiduciary obligation other than the holding of

Broker, and the Broker shall have the right to terminate its services as Broker
under the Plan as provided in the applicable contract.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brokerage commissions on purchases of Common Stock under the Plan and all
administrative fees of the Broker incurred in connection with the Plan shall be
paid by the Participant&#146;s employer.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brokerage commissions and other expenses incurred in connection with
purchases of additional Common Stock or sales and other transfers of Common
Stock shall be paid by the Participant.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that shares purchased by the Broker are held in a Company
account, for each purchase of shares by the Broker, the Recordskeeper shall
allocate the shares in the Company account to the Participants in proportion to
the amount of funds delivered to the Broker on behalf of each such Participant.
In the event that the services contract with the Broker provides for the
establishment of individual accounts for Participants, shares purchased by the
Broker shall be allocated to the respective accounts of the Participants in
proportion to the amount of such funds delivered to the Broker on behalf of
each Participant.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocation shall be made in whole shares and fractional share interests to
the nearest thousandth of a share. Allocations shall be made as soon as is
administratively feasible, but in no event sooner than three (3)&nbsp;business days
after the purchase of Common Stock.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If shares are purchased at more than one price in any one payperiod, the
cost of each share purchased in that payperiod shall be the average cost of all
shares purchased with funds transmitted to the Broker for that payperiod.

beneficial ownership of its respective shares and fractional share interests
purchased by the Broker, unless the Participant establishes an individual
account with the Broker and requests that the shares be registered in the
Participant&#146;s name.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the services contract with the Broker provides for the establishment of
individual accounts, then unless otherwise requested by the Participant, all
shares shall be registered in the name of the Broker and shall remain so
registered until delivery or sale of the shares is requested by the
Participant. If the services contract with the Broker provides for the
establishment of an account in the name of the Company, all shares shall be
registered in the name of the Company. Under either method of holding shares
purchased under the Plan, a Participant may request a certificate for any or
all of his or her whole shares to be delivered to him or her at any time. A
Participant may not require delivery of a certificate for a fractional interest
in a share because the remaining fraction of that share is owned by other
Participants. However, the Participant may instruct the Recordskeeper or
Broker to sell the fractional interest and remit the proceeds to him or her.
The services contract with the Recordskeeper or Broker shall specify whether
the Recordskeeper or Broker is to be provided with the requisite instruction.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the services contract with the Broker provides for the establishment of
an account in the name of the Company, a Participant may make arrangements to
transfer his or her pro-rata share of the shares in the Company account to an
individual account that the Participant opens with the Broker. The Participant
must notify the Recordskeeper of any such arrangements.

the party to whom a Participant must provide sale instructions. The Broker or
Recordskeeper may establish rules requiring that any sale instructions be
delivered by a specified time or in a specified manner. Upon such sale, the
Broker or Recordskeeper will mail the Participant a check for the proceeds in
U.S. or Canadian dollars, or such other currency as may be specified in the
contract with the Broker or Recordskeeper, as the case may be, less the regular
brokerage commission and any transfer taxes, registration fee or other normal
charges which shall be payable by the Participant.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sale of all shares owned by a Participant, or a request for delivery of
certificates for all shares owned, shall not affect the employee&#146;s status as a

authorization.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individual account is established for a Participant, such
Participant may, at any time, instruct the Broker in writing to purchase
additional shares of Common Stock for his or her individual account. Any such
purchases shall be made by the Broker in the open market and in accordance with
the customary practices of brokers in executing orders for customers. All
costs and expenses relating to any such additional purchases shall be borne by
the Participant. Shares of Common Stock so purchased for a Participant
pursuant to this section shall be allocated to such Participant&#146;s individual
account and such shares shall thereafter be held and dealt with by the Broker
in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Broker or Recordskeeper will forward to each Participant, on a
quarterly basis, a confirmation statement indicating the number of shares of
Common Stock acquired under the Plan (including, for Canadian participants,
fractions to the fourth decimal and, for all
other participants, fractions to the sixth decimal) for his or her account, the
cost of the shares in U.S. or Canadian dollars, the date of acquisition, and
the total number of shares then credited to his or her account. The services

Company account, will be credited with any and all dividends paid with respect
to the full shares and any fractional interest in a share held in his or her
account or his or her pro-rata share in the Company account. Any cash
dividends will be reinvested in Common Stock as promptly as practicable
following receipt of the dividends by the Broker, unless the Participant
instructs the Broker or Recordskeeper to the contrary. The source of such
shares shall be from either the Company&#146;s treasury stock or the open market, as
determined by the Board. If the source of the shares is the Company&#146;s treasury
stock, the purchase price per share shall be the Fair Market Value of a share
of Common Stock determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;5 of the Plan. The
services contract with the Broker or Recordskeeper shall specify the party to
which the Participant must issue instructions. Regular brokerage commissions
payable by the Participant (or the Company, if the Participant&#146;s shares are
held in a Company account) with respect to Common Stock purchased with
reinvested cash dividends will be deducted from the amount of each dividend to
be reinvested.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock dividends and stock splits in respect of shares held in the
Participant&#146;s account or the Company account will be credited to the applicable
account without charge. Any other securities or subscription rights
distributed with respect to the Common Stock will be sold and the proceeds will
be applied in the same manner as a cash dividend.
