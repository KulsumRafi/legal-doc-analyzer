<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of SHG (an "Acquiring Person"), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 33 1/3% of the then outstanding voting stock of  SHG;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A merger or consolidation of SHG with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of SHG outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 51% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of SHG or surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">provided, however, in no event shall any acquisition of securities, a change in the composition of the Board of Directors or a merger or other consolidation pursuant to a plan of reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to SHG ("Chapter 11 Plan"), or a liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code constitute a Change in Control.  In addition, notwithstanding Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(2), 6(c)(3) and 6(c)(4), a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred in the event of a sale or conveyance in which SHG continues as a holding company of an entity or entities that conduct the business or businesses formerly conducted by SHG, or any transaction undertaken for the purpose of reincorporating SHG under the laws of another jurisdiction, if such transaction does not materially affect the beneficial ownership of SHG's capital stock.  Ms. Fisher's continued employment without objection following a Change in Control shall not, by itself, constitute consent to or a waiver of rights with respect to any circumstances constituting Good Reason hereunder.

</B></U><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Gross-Up Payments.</B></U>  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if it is determined that any payment to Ms. Fisher this Agreement would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then Ms. Fisher shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place Ms. Fisher in the same after-tax economic position that she would have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had not applied to the payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by a nationally prominent  accounting firm retained by SHG (the "Accounting Firm") using such formulas as the Accounting Firm deems appropriate.  No Gross-Up Payment shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm determines that the payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Determination of Gross-Up Payment.</B></U>  Subject to the provisions of Section 7(c), all determinations required under this Section 7, including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the payments constituting parachute payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to SHG and Ms. Fisher within fifteen business days of Ms. Fisher's date of termination or any other date reasonably requested by SHG or Ms. Fisher on which a determination under Section 7 is necessary or advisable.  SHG shall pay to Ms. Fisher the initial Gross-Up Payment within five days of the receipt by Ms. Fisher and SHG of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Ms. Fisher, SHG shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide Ms. Fisher and SHG with an opinion that SHG has substantial authority under the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on Ms. Fisher's federal income tax return.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Ms. Fisher and SHG.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be owing by Ms. Fisher with respect to any payment (hereinafter an "Underpayment"), SHG, after exhausting its remedies under Section 7(c) below, shall promptly pay to Ms. Fisher an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.  </P>
<P ALIGN="center">8</P>
<hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Procedures.</B></U>  Ms. Fisher shall notify SHG in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by SHG of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable after Ms. Fisher knows of such claim and Ms. Fisher shall apprise SHG of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to be paid.  Ms. Fisher agrees not to pay the claim until the expiration of the thirty-day period following the date on which Ms. Fisher notifies SHG, or such shorter period ending on the date the taxes with respect to such claim are due (the "Notice Period").  If SHG notifies Ms. Fisher in writing prior to the expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, Ms. Fisher shall: (i) give SHG any information reasonably requested by SHG relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the claim as SHG may reasonably request, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by SHG and reasonably acceptable to Ms. Fisher; (iii) cooperate with SHG in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit SHG to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  Ms. Fisher shall permit SHG to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit SHG to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by SHG, Ms. Fisher agrees either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner and to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts as SHG shall determine; provided, however, that if SHG directs Ms. Fisher to pay such claim and pursue a refund, SHG shall advance the amount of such payment to Ms. Fisher on an after-tax and interest-free basis (the "Advance").  SHG's control of the contest related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and Ms. Fisher shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If SHG does not notify Ms. Fisher in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to contest the claim, SHG shall pay to Ms. Fisher an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and Ms. Fisher agrees to pay the amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Repayments.</B></U>  If, after receipt by Ms. Fisher of an Advance, Ms. Fisher becomes entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance relates, Ms. Fisher shall pay SHG the amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by Ms. Fisher of an Advance, a determination is made that Ms. Fisher shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and SHG does not promptly notify Ms. Fisher of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by Ms. Fisher and the amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing to Ms. Fisher.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">9</P>
<hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Further Assurances.</B></U>  SHG shall indemnify Ms. Fisher and hold her harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by Ms. Fisher with respect to the exercise by SHG of any of its rights under Section 7, including, without limitation, any Losses related to SHG's decision to contest a claim or any imputed income to him resulting from any Advance or action taken on Ms. Fisher's behalf by SHG hereunder.  SHG shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred under Section 7 and shall promptly reimburse Ms. Fisher for the reasonable expenses incurred by her in connection with any actions taken by SHG or required to be taken by Ms. Fisher hereunder.  SHG shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion referred to in Section 7(b).</P></DIR>
