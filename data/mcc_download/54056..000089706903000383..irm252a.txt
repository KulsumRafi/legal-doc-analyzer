                                  Plan Overview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    Performance cycles of three years are established as the performance period
     of the long term incentive plan to which the incentive awards relate. A new
     overlapping performance cycle begins at the start of each new calendar
     year,

o    Performance credits are calculated based on the selection of a market
     multiple multiplied by the annualized base salary to determine the midpoint
     value for each eligible plan participant. The midpoint award value is
     divided by $100 to arrive at the number of performance credits to be
     granted.

o    Performance credits are granted to each eligible participant prior to the
     beginning of the performance cycle. Performance credits for subsidiary
     presidents are granted in a combination of subsidiary and corporate
     performance credits while performance credits for corporate officers are
     granted in corporate performance credits only.

o    Performance credit values are based on the achievement of pre-determined
     performance goals of the subsidiary and/or corporation. The value of these
     performance credits are set for the minimum, midpoint and maximum level of
     subsidiary and/or corporate performance goals based on a pre-determined
     performance measure(s). Performance measures and goals for the corporation
     and subsidiaries as well as performance values as set by the CEO and
     approved by the Compensation Committee for each eligible participant.

o    Each participant's long term incentive award will be determined based on
     the degree to which three year performance at the subsidiary and/or
     corporate level is achieved at the

                                       4
<PAGE>

     conclusion of the performance cycle. Based on the performance goal achieved
     at the end of the cycle, the performance credit's value will be determined
     and multiplied by the number of credits awarded to the participant at the
     beginning of the year to determine the long term award earned for that
     performance cycle.

o    Participants' long term incentive awards will be calculated after the end
     of each performance cycle.

                          Eligibility and Participation

                                and Distribution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    The number of performance credits and the distribution between corporate
     and subsidiary performance units for eligible employees may be adjusted as
     those employees move in and out of positions. Generally, the following
     conventions will apply when these changes occur:

     o    Eligible participants who are assigned to different eligible positions
          will be considered for purposes of this Plan to have become eligible
          for that position's performance credits as well as to be eligible to
          begin a new performance cycle in the year of promotion if it is in or
          before June 30th of that year. Eligible participants who start on or
          after July 1st would become eligible for that position's performance
          credits as well as begin a new performance cycle on the first day of
          the new calendar year. Long term incentive awards will be pro-rated
          proportionately between each position depending on the start date of
          the new position.

     o    Non-eligible employees who are promoted and/or newly-hired into an
          eligible position must be in the position on or before June 20th of
          that year to become immediately eligible for the new position's
          performance credits and distribution, performance goals and
          performance goals. Non-eligible employees who are promoted and/or
          newly hired on July 1st become eligible on the first day of the new
          calendar year.

               Establishment of Performance Measures and Minimum,
                     Midpoint and Maximum Goals for the CEO

o    Corporate performance measures, goals, performance credits and their values
     will be established for the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.

o    Corporate and subsidiary performance measures and goals for all other
     eligible participants will be established by the CEO for approval by the
     Compensation Committee.

                        Determination of Incentive Awards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    Long term incentive awards are based on the value of performance credits
     multiplied by the number of performance credits awarded to each eligible
     participant. The amount of the incentive award may vary from the
     participant's midpoint incentive opportunity up to the maximum or down to
     the minimum of the incentive opportunity range if the performance of a
     particular component has exceeded or has not met its midpoint goal.
     Performance credits will have no value if performance fails to reach the
     minimum.

                                       6
<PAGE>

     Incentive opportunity ranges between the minimum and the maximum will be
     interpolated for incentive award determination.

o    The Compensation Committee will approve final value of the performance
     credits, the long term incentive awards and individual payments for all
     Plan participants.

                           Payment of Incentive Awards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    Long term incentive awards will be paid before the close of the first
     quarter, if practical, following the completion of the performance cycle to
     which the incentive award relates.

o    The incentive awards will be paid in the form of cash or deferred at the
     request of each respective participant into Journal's Non-Qualified
     Deferred Compensation Plan.

                            Termination of Employment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    The Compensation Committee shall have the sole authority and discretion to
     make decisions regarding the payment of incentives for participants who
     terminate employment voluntarily or involuntarily during the performance
     cycle due to retirement, disability or for other reasons.

                        No Enlargement of Employee Rights

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Plan participant
     the right to be retained in the service of Journal or to interfere with the
     right of Journal to discharge, discipline or retire any participant at any
     time.

                      Modification and Changes to the Plan
                              and Incentive Awards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    The Compensation Committee may, at any time prior to the approval of the
     long term incentive awards, approve a modification or change to the
     performance measures and/or goals for any participant or participants. Such
     a change may be desirable in the interests of equitable treatment of the
     participants and Journal as a result of extraordinary or non-recurring
     events, changes in applicable accounting rules or principles, changes in
     Journals method of accounting, changes in applicable law, changes due to
     consolidation, acquisition, divestiture, reorganization or other changes in
     Journals structure, major changes in business strategy or any other change
     or a similar nature to any of the foregoing.

     presence of extraordinary occurrences during the Performance Cycle.

     significant influence of Plan participants and would,

                                       7
<PAGE>

     by their inclusion, cause a significant unintended effect, positive or
     negative, on the corporate or subsidiary performance results.

                         Relationship to Other Benefits

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    No payment under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any
     benefit under any pension, retirement, group insurance or other benefit
     plan of Journal or its subsidiaries except as otherwise specifically
     provided in the respective benefits plan agreement.

                          Limitation on Vested Interest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    The earning of long term incentive awards by eligible employees under this
     Plan is within the sole discretion of Journal in accordance with the terms
     of this Plan, and no eligible employee or other person has any legal right
     or vested interest in an incentive award under this Plan prior to the
     actual payment to the eligible employee as an incentive award.

     provided that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action,
     suit or proceeding, such Committee member shall, in writing, offer Journal
