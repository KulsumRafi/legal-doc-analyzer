benefits received by the Corporation (or other liable parties) on the one hand and Indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction from which the non-indemnifiable claim arose, and (2) the relative fault of the Corporation (or other liable
parties) on the one hand and of Indemnitee on the other in connection with the events that resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines, or settlement amounts, as well as any other relevant, equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
Indemnitee shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties&#146; intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or to prevent the </font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center'><font size=2>

deny indemnity and 30 days from receipt of the Notice to present evidence showing that the acts in controversy are indemnifiable, because they were undertaken in the reasonable belief of their legality and that they were in the best interests of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall promptly review any additional evidence submitted and issue a final, written determination advising whether or not continuing indemnity will be provided and any restrictions or limitations thereon. If the
determination is that continuing indemnity will be terminated or reduced, then no later than 10 days after receipt of that decision, Indemnitee may request review by the Corporation or request non-binding mediation by an independent, third party
mediator selected in accordance with procedures established by a recognized entity, such as JAMS or the American Arbitration Association, providing such services at Indemnitee&#146;s place of residence or other mutually agreeable location to assist
in resolving this matter. The costs of such mediation will be borne equally by the Corporation and Indemnitee. All review proceedings and determinations under this Section shall be deemed confidential and protected from public disclosure by the

including any non-binding mediation, if elected, unless the Corporation&#146;s indemnity obligation is terminated earlier by court order. Nothing stated herein shall prevent the parties from settling any dispute by mutual agreement at any time, and
either party may, at any time, commence a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain judicial review of any decision regarding indemnity; provided, however, that commencement of a judicial proceeding by Indemnitee shall be deemed to
end the appeals process and shall constitute a waiver of any further internal review of an indemnity decision made in accordance with Section 4. If a court orders payment of indemnification or advances for expenses to an Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section, Indemnitee also shall be entitled to recover the expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, incurred in obtaining the court-ordered payments.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>6.</font><font
