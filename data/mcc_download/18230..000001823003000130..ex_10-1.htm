<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 1.  Purpose<br>
<br>
</B>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The Caterpillar Inc. 1996 Stock Option and Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") is designed to attract and retain outstanding individuals as directors, officers and key employees of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), and to furnish incentives to such individuals through awards based upon the performance of the Company and its stock. To this end, the Plan provides for grants of stock options, restricted stock, and performance awards, or combinations thereof, to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan.<B><br>
<br>
Section 2.  Shares Subject to the Plan<br>
<br>
</B>2.1  <I>Shares Reserved for Issuance<br>
<br>
</I>Thirty-nine million shares of Company common stock ("Shares") shall be available for issuance under the Plan either from authorized but unissued Shares or from Shares acquired by the Company, including Shares purchased in the open market. An additional four million Shares authorized but unissued under prior Company stock option plans shall be available for issuance under this Plan.<br>
<br>
2.2  <I>Stock Splits/Stock Dividends<br>
<br>
</I>In the event of a change in the outstanding Shares of the Company by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, or similar event, the Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors ("Board") shall take any action, which, in its discretion, it deems necessary to preserve benefits under the Plan, including adjustment to the aggregate number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, the number and option price of Shares subject to outstanding options granted under the Plan and the number and price of Shares subject to other awards under the Plan.<br>
<br>
2.3 <I>Reacquired Shares<br>
<br>
</I>If Shares issued pursuant to the Plan are not acquired by participants because of lapse, expiration or termination of an award, such Shares shall again become available for issuance under the Plan. Shares tendered upon exercise of an option by a Plan participant may be added back and made available solely for future grants under the Plan.<B><br>

Section 3.  Administration<br>
<br>
</B>The Committee shall have the authority to grant awards under the Plan to officers and other key employees of the Company. Except as limited by the express provisions of the Plan or by resolutions adopted by the Board, the Committee also shall have the authority and discretion to interpret the Plan, to establish and revise rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it believes necessary or advisable for administration of the Plan.<br>
<br>
The Committee shall be composed solely of members of the Board that are outside directors, as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee shall have no authority with respect to non-employee director awards under the Plan.<B><br>
<br>
Section 4.  Stock Options<br>
<br>
</B>4.1  <I>Company Employees<br>
<br>
</I>(a) Eligibility<br>
<br>
The Committee shall determine Company officers and employees to whom options shall be granted, the timing of such grants, and the number of shares subject to the option; provided that the maximum number of Shares upon which options may be granted to any employee in any calendar year shall be 400,000.<br>
<br>
(b) Option Exercise Price<br>
<br>
The exercise price of each option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Shares underlying the option at the time the option is granted. The fair market value for purposes of determining the exercise price shall be the mean between the high and low prices at which Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange the day the option is granted. In the event this method for determining fair market value is not practicable, fair market value shall be determined by such other reasonable method as the Committee shall select.<br>
<br>
(c) Option Exercise<br>
<br>
Options shall be exercisable in such installments and during such periods as may be fixed by the Committee at the time of grant. Options that are not incentive stock options as defined in Section 4.1(f) of the Plan shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant.<br>
<br>
Payment of the exercise price shall be made upon exercise of all or a portion of any option. Such payment shall be in cash or by tendering Shares having a fair market value equal to 100% of the exercise price. The fair market value of Shares for this purpose shall be the mean between the high and low prices at which Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise. Upon exercise of an option, any applicable taxes the Company is required to withhold shall be paid to the Company. Shares to be received upon exercise may be surrendered to satisfy withholding obligations.<br>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Times">
(d) Termination of Employment<br>
<br>
The Committee may require a period of continued employment before an option can be exercised. That period shall not be less than one year, except that the Committee may permit a shorter period in the event of termination of employment by retirement or death.<br>
<br>
Termination of employment with the Company shall terminate remaining rights under options then held; provided, however, that an option grant may provide that if employment terminates after completion of a specific period, the option may be exercised during a period of time after termination. That period may not exceed sixty months where termination of employment is caused by retirement or death or sixty days where termination results from any other cause. If death occurs after termination of employment but during the period of time specified, such period may be extended to not more than sixty-six months after retirement, or thirty-eight months after termination of employment for any other cause. In the event of termination within two years after a Change of Control as defined in Section 8.2 of the Plan, options shall be exercisable for a period of sixty months following the date of termination or for the maximum term of the option, whichever is shorter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may change the post-termination period of exercisability of an option provided that change does not extend the original maximum term of the option.<br>
<br>
(e) Transferability of Options<br>
<br>
(i)  Except as otherwise permitted in Section 4.1(e)(ii), options shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Options are exercisable during the holder's lifetime only by the holder, unless the holder becomes incapacitated or disabled, in which case the option may be exercised by the holder's authorized representative. A holder may file with the Company a written designation of beneficiaries with the authority to exercise options in the event of the holder's death.<br>
<br>
(ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(e)(i), and in addition to the permissible transfers under that provision, options granted to persons at the level of Vice President and above, as well as directors of this corporation and persons retired from those positions, may be transferred to any one or more "Permitted Transferees," as long as those options are not incentive stock options as defined below and are fully vested.  Options granted to employees below the level of Vice President may be transferred upon prior approval of the Company's Director of Compensation and Benefits pursuant to the terms of this section.<br>

<P ALIGN="center"><font face="Times" size="1">Page 3</font></P>
<hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)  For purposes of Section 4.1(e)(ii), the term "Permitted Transferees" shall mean the members of the group that consists exclusively of the individual to whom the option is granted, the spouse of the individual to whom the option is granted, the lineal descendants of the individual to whom the option is granted, the spouses of the lineal descendents to whom the option is granted, the lineal descendants of any spouse or former spouse of the individual to whom the option is granted, the spouses of the lineal descendants of any spouse or former spouse of the individual to whom the option is granted, the estate (and any trust that serves a distributive function of an estate) of the Permitted Transferee, all trusts that an individual who is a Permitted Transferee can revoke and all trusts, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities in which, directly or indirectly, but for the exercise of a power of appointment or the death of the survivor of the individual who are Permitted Transferees.  Each owner of an equitable interest is an individual who is a Permitted Transferee.<FONT FACE="Times"><br>
<br>
(f) Incentive Stock Options<br>
<br>
Incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, may be granted under the Plan. The decision to grant incentive stock options to particular persons is within the Committee's discretion. Incentive stock options shall not be exercisable after expiration of ten years from the date of grant. The amount of incentive stock options vesting in a particular year cannot exceed $100,000 per option recipient, based on the fair market value of the options on the date of grant; provided that any portion of an option that cannot be exercised as an incentive stock option because of this limitation may be converted by the Committee to another form of option. The Board may amend the Plan to comply with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable laws and to permit options previously granted to be converted to incentive stock options.<br>
<br>
4.2 <I>Non-Employee Directors<br>
<br>
</I>(a)  Terms<br>
<br>
Subject to the share ownership requirements, options with a term of ten years are granted to each non-employee director for 4,000 Shares, effective as of the close of each annual meeting of stockholders at which an individual is elected a director or following which such individual continues as a director. Options granted to non-employee directors shall become exercisable by one-third at the end of each of the three successive one-year periods since the date of grant. The exercise price of each option shall be 100% of the fair market value of Shares underlying the option on the date of grant.<br>
<br>
(b) Termination of Directorship<br>
<br>
An option awarded to a non-employee director may be exercised any time within 60&nbsp;months of the date the director terminates such status. In the event of a director's death, the director's authorized representative may exercise the option within 60 months of the date of death, provided that if the director dies after cessation of director status, the option is exercisable within 66 months of such cessation. In no event shall an option awarded to a non-employee director be exercisable beyond the expiration date of that option.<B><br>

6.1 <I>Eligibility and Terms<br>
<br>
</I>The Committee may grant awards to officers and other key employees ("Performance Awards") based upon Company performance over a period of years ("Performance Period").  The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine persons eligible to participate, the Performance Period, Company performance factors applicable to the award ("Performance Measures"), and the method of Performance Award calculation.<br>
<br>
At the time the Committee establishes a Performance Period for a particular award, it shall also establish Performance Measures and targets to be attained relative to those measures ("Performance Targets").

The Committee may establish the peer group referenced above and amend the peer group as the Committee determines desirable.  Performance Targets may include a minimum, maximum and target level of performance with the size of Performance Awards based on the level attained.  Once established, Performance Targets and Performance Measures shall not be changed during the Performance Period; provided, however, that the Committee may eliminate or decrease the amount of a Performance Award otherwise payable to a participant.  Upon completion of a Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the Company's performance in relation to the Performance Targets for that period and certify in writing the extent to which Performance Targets were satisfied.<br>
<br>
6.2  <I>Payment of Awards<br>
