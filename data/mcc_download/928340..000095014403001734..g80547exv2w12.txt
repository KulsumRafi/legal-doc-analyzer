BETWEEN:

(1)      Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. of P.O. Box 1114 GT, Grand Cayman

         completion thereof by way of amending agreements dated November 15,
         2002 and December 18, 2002 (the "Amending Agreements"), and the
         parties have now agreed that the conditions precedent to the Agreement
         will not be satisfied by the extended date contemplated for completion

and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged the
