+ Fee is only applicable to new customer names on entire list. For efficiency
and cost purposes, the entire list of customers is sent each quarter. The market
fee comparison ($65/K/quarter) used is for new customer accounts only. In any
given quarter, approximately 10% of the names sent represent new customers.
Therefore, the fee will be calculated as follows:

        $65.00 x 10% equals $6.50.

Thus, the fee to be paid will equal $6.50/K/quarter on the entire list. This
adjusted figure approximates a market fee for the new accounts.

Bank, a Delaware banking corporation and Western Financial Bank, a federal
savings bank.
