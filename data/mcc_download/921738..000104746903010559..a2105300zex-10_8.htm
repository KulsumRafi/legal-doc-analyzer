<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Executive desires to become employed by the Company, and the Company desires to employ Executive upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT

accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties and Responsibilities.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing on September&nbsp;3, 2002 (the "Commencement Date"), Executive
shall serve as the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Executive shall perform all duties and accept all responsibilities incident to such position as may be reasonably assigned
to him by the Company's Chief Executive Officer or by the Board of Directors (the "Board"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of this Agreement shall begin on the date hereof and shall terminate on the second
anniversary of the Commencement Date (the "Initial Term") unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;3 hereof. This Agreement shall automatically renew for additional
one-year periods (each, a "Renewal Term" and, together with the Initial Term, the "Employment Term") unless either party has delivered written notice of non-renewal at least
90&nbsp;days prior to the start of a Renewal Term or unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;3 hereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extent of Service.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive agrees to use Executive's best efforts to carry out Executive's duties and
responsibilities and, consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement, to devote substantially all of Executive's business time, attention and energy thereto. The foregoing shall not be
construed as preventing Executive from engaging in other business activities, provided that Executive agrees not to become engaged in any other business activity which, in the reasonable judgment of
the Board, is likely to interfere with Executive's ability to discharge Executive's duties and responsibilities to the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Bonus.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive shall be eligible for an annual cash bonus determined in accordance with the Senior
Management Incentive Compensation Plan provided that the maximum bonus percentage may, in the discretion of the Board, be limited to 50% of the Base Salary. Executive may also be eligible to receive
such other cash bonuses as the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may elect, in their sole discretion, to grant to Executive to award meritorious performance or such other criteria as the Board or
the Chief Executive Officer may, from time to time, establish. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3</FONT><FONT
