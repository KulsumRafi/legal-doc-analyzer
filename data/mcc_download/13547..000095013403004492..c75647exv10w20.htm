herein provided for, and to perform and observe each and all of the matters and
things provided for in said Loan Documents. Lender was not organized for the
purpose of purchasing the Note or making an investment in the Conversion
Securities. The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the
performance or observance of the terms thereof have been duly authorized by all
necessary Lender Board of Directors action and do not contravene or violate any
provision of law or any charter or bylaw provision or any covenant, indenture
or agreement of or binding upon Lender.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment Intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Note being entered into by Lender is being
purchased for investment for its own account and not with the view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof. Lender
understands that neither the Note nor any Conversion Securities issuable upon
conversion thereof have been registered under the Act or any state securities
laws by reason of their contemplated issuance in transactions exempt from the
registration requirements of the Act and applicable state securities laws, and
that the reliance of Borrower upon these exemptions is predicated in part upon
this representation by Lender. Lender further acknowledges that the Note, and
the Conversion Securities issuable upon conversion thereof, may not be
transferred or resold without (i)&nbsp;registration under the Act and any applicable
state securities laws, or (ii)&nbsp;an exemption from the requirements of the Act
and applicable state securities laws. Lender acknowledges that any conversion
by it of the Note into Conversion Securities involves a highly speculative
investment and a high degree of risk. Lender acknowledges that it may not ever
be able to resell any of the Conversion Securities into which the Note may be
converted, whether at the applicable conversion price or otherwise. Neither
Borrower nor NextNet has any obligation to register any of the Conversion
Securities for resale under the Act or any applicable state securities laws, or
to take any other action which would facilitate the availability of federal or
state registration exemptions in connection with any resale of such shares.

securities laws, which may, if requested by Borrower and/or NextNet, require
