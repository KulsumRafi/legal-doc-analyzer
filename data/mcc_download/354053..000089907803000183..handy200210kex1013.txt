          Employee the following:

     a. For the period from August 20, 2001 through December 31, 2002,  Employer
shall pay Employee  Thirteen  Thousand,  Seven Hundred Fifty and No/100  Dollars

     "a. The Term of  Employment  by Employer  shall mean the period  commencing
August 20, 2001 and terminating  December 31, 2003,  unless sooner terminated in
accordance  with the terms  and  conditions  hereinafter  set  forth,  provided,
however, in the event of the death of the Employee, the Term of Employment shall
end on the date of the death of Employee."

     Except as amended above, the Agreement  remains  unchanged and continues in
full force and effect.

     This First  Amendment is executed in multiple  counterparts,  each of which
shall have the force and effect of an original, this 6th day of March, 2003.
