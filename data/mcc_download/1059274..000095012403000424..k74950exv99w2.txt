                  (ii)     The Agent may at any time in its sole and absolute
discretion require that a Revolving Credit Loan be made to pay off any Cash
Management Obligations, and upon written notice thereof by the Agent to the

6.1(h), Loans as described in Section 2.1(a)(ii) may not be made by the
Revolving Credit Lenders, then (A) the Borrowers agree that all Cash Management
Obligations not paid pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii) shall bear interest, payable
on demand by the Agent, at the Overdue Rate, and (B) effective on the date each
such Loan would otherwise have been made, each Lender severally agrees that it
shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the occurrence of any
Unmatured Event or Event of Default or any other circumstances, in lieu of
deemed disbursement of loans, to the extent of such Revolving Credit Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment, purchase a participating interest in the Cash
Management Obligations by paying its pro rata share (based on such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment) thereof, provided that the aggregate amount of such
participating interests required to be purchased under this Section 2.1(iii) may

Lender shall not have so made the amount of such participating interest
available to the Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender and the Borrowers severally

amount is paid to the Agent, at (x) in the case of the Company, the interest

                  (i)      Any Borrower may request the Agent to make, and the
Agent may, in its sole discretion, make Swingline Loans to such Borrower from

the Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time

Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment) of each Swingline Loan for purposes of
determining the amount of Revolving Credit Advances required to be made by such
Lender. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the Negotiated Rate and shall
mature as agreed by the Agent and such Borrower, any such maturity not to exceed
the Termination Date, and may be advanced in any manner agreed to by the Agent
and the Borrowers, including without limitation by the Agent crediting global

Facility, so long as the Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to make Swingline
Loans, the Borrowers may borrow and reborrow under this Section 2.1(b)(i).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Swingline Loans shall be made
only in currencies other than Dollars and shall not be made to the Company or
any of its Domestic Subsidiaries. Each Swingline Loan shall be redenominated in
Dollars or an Eligible Currency by the Agent prior to such Swingline Loan being
refunded with a Revolving Credit Loan or any Revolving Credit Lender purchasing
its participation in such Swingline Loan.

                  1.7      Section 2.1(e)(i) is restated as follows: "(i) the
Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances outstanding to the Borrowers shall not exceed at any time an amount
equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of the Borrowing Base minus the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans or (B) the aggregate amount of
the Revolving Credit Commitments minus the Cash Management Blocked Amount;".

any Domestic Subsidiary and 65% of all Capital Stock (or, if such 65% pledge of
Capital Stock cannot be obtained or would cause an additional and material tax

and/or rights with respect to such Foreign Subsidiaries and such other
arrangements and agreements as required by the Agent) of all Foreign
Subsidiaries owned directly by the Company or by any Domestic Subsidiary and

the opinion of the Agent are necessary or advisable in connection therewith;

costly, and (iii) each parent corporation of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and

                  4.4      Each of the Borrowers and Guarantors represents and
warrants that it is not aware of any claims or causes of action against the
Agent or any Lender, any participant lender or any of their successors or

of itself and its respective employees, agents, executors, heirs, successors and
assigns (the "Releasing Parties"), hereby releases the Agent and the Lenders,
their respective predecessors, officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and assigns, from any liability,
claim, right or cause of action which now exists or hereafter arises as a result
of acts, omissions or events occurring on or prior to the date hereof, whether

Amendment other than those which are set forth in this Amendment. Each of the
Borrowers and Guarantors acknowledges that an authorized officer of each
Borrower and Guarantor has thoroughly read and reviewed the terms and provisions

                  4.9      This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. Facsimile copies of signatures shall be treated as
original signatures for all purposes under this Amendment.

                  4.10     Each of the Borrowers and Guarantors agrees to
execute and deliver any and all documents reasonably deemed necessary or
appropriate by the Agent or the Lenders to carry out the intent of and/or to
implement this Amendment.

                  4.11     This Amendment shall not be construed more strictly
against the Lenders or the Agent merely by virtue of the fact that the same has
been prepared by the Lenders and the Agent or their counsel, it being recognized
that the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders have contributed substantially and
materially to the preparation of this Amendment, and each of the parties hereto
waives any claim contesting the existence and the adequacy of the consideration
given by any of the other parties hereto in entering into this Amendment.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any matter in connection with any phase of
the Company's or any of its Subsidiary's business or operations. Each of the
Borrowers and Guarantors agrees that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have
liability to the Company (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) or
any of its Subsidiaries for losses suffered by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the
transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan
Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith or
otherwise, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought or from a breach
by the party from which recovery is sought of the express terms of the Loan
Documents. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability with
respect to, and each of the Borrowers and Guarantors hereby waives, releases and
agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential damages suffered
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, arising out of, or
in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby.

                  4.13     The Borrowers and the Guarantors have informed the
Lenders and the Agent that Events of Default may have occurred under the Credit
Agreement due to breaches of Sections 5.2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) as of
December 29, 2002 (the "Potential Defaults"), and such Potential Defaults have
been waived until February 17, 2003 pursuant to a waiver letter signed by the
Required Banks dated December 23, 2002. Each Borrower and Guarantor has
requested that the Lenders waive the Potential Defaults subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein. Pursuant to such request, the Lenders hereby waive
the Potential Defaults that occurred as of December 29, 2002, provided that an
Event of Default shall occur and is not waived if the Borrowers breach Sections
5.2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), as amended by this Amendment, at any time after
the Third Amendment Effective Date or at any time thereafter. The Lenders do not
waive any other Event of Default or Unmatured Event. Each Borrower and Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that the waiver contained herein is a limited, specific
and one-time waiver as described above. Such limited waiver shall not modify or
waive any other term, covenant or agreement contained in any of the Loan
Documents, and shall not be deemed to have prejudiced any present or future
right or rights which the Agent or any Lender now has or may have.

                  4.14     As collateral security for the prompt payment in full
when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the
Lender Indebtedness, the Company hereby pledges, grants and collaterally assigns
to the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and Lenders as hereinafter provided,
a security interest in all (i) right, title and interest of the Company in and
to the Funding Agreement and to

case may be, pursuant to the Funding Agreement, and (ii) all other claims,
rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Company arising under
the Funding Agreement and resulting from any failure by CSCL or one or more of
its designees, as the case may be, to perform its obligations hereunder,
together in each case with the full power and authority to demand payment of,
enforce, collect, receive and deliver receipt for any and all of the foregoing.
