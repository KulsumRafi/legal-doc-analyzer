Dear Linda:

     We are very happy that you have decided to join APAC. Your title will be
Vice President and General Counsel and you will report to the President or
another member of senior most management of APAC as shall be designated by APAC.
As agreed, the following employment terms will apply:

     1.   Your starting base salary will be $220,000 on an annualized basis.

     2.   You will be a participant in APAC's Incentive Bonus Plan with a forty
          percent (40%) of salary participation. Assuming that APAC meets its
          budgeted performance and you meet your individual and team performance
          goals, your 1999 Incentive Bonus would be $88,000 prorated for less
          than a full year of service.

     3.   You will be entitled to the benefits, vacation and perquisites
          normally available to comparable level employees.

     4.   You are being granted options to purchase thirty thousand (30,000)
          shares of APAC stock at an exercise price equal to the mean between
          the high and the low price at which APAC's common stock traded on the
          day you begin work at APAC as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets,
          such options to be issued in the form of the option grant materials
          attached hereto. Notwithstanding the provisions of these option grant
          materials,

          in the event that following or in connection with a "Change of
          Control" (as hereinafter defined) your employment with APAC terminates
          for "Good Reason" (as hereinafter defined), then all of your APAC
          stock options granted pursuant to this letter agreement shall then be
          fully vested.

          For purposes hereof, the term "Change of Control" as used herein,
          shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) the Company sells all or
          substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party or (ii) a
          person or entity (other than Theodore G. Schwartz and/or trusts for
          the benefit of members of his family) obtains the control of a
          majority of the votes of the capital stock of the company (other than
          through revocable proxies).

          For purposes hereof, the term "Good Reason" shall mean any of (i) your
          dismissal from employment by APAC, other than for "cause" (as defined
          in our stock option grant materials), (ii) your voluntary resignation
          within ninety (90) days following (A) a material alteration in your
          title or responsibilities or (B) relocation of your office by more
          than twenty (20) miles from both your current personal residence and
          Deerfield, Illinois; provided, such voluntary resignation shall be
          upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice and the
          reasons specified therein are not cured during the thirty (30) day
          period immediately following such notice.

     5.   You will sign a Restrictive Covenant Agreement (form attached)
          concurrent herewith.

     6.   If you have not voluntarily resigned your employment or been
          terminated by APAC for "cause" prior to January 1, 2000, in addition
          to any Incentive Bonus payments to which you may be entitled, APAC
          shall pay to you a special one-time bonus of $40,000 within fourteen
          (14) days thereafter.

     7.   If APAC terminates your employment other than for "cause" or if you
          resign for "Good Reason", you will be entitled to severance benefits
          equal to twelve (12) months base salary to be paid in equal monthly
          installments over the twelve (12) month period immediately following
          such termination of employment.

     8.   Your employment will be full-time and best efforts.

     9.   Your effective commencement date is June 1, 1999 or such other date as
          we shall mutually agree.

     10.  You will be based in our Deerfield, Illinois office.

     We are excited to have you join the team, and we look forward to working
with you.

     Best personal regards.

                                                      Very truly yours,


                                                      /s/ Marc S. Simon
                                                      Marc S. Simon
                                                      President
