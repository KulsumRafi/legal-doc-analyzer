         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, each of the undersigned, jointly and severally,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "BORROWERS", and each individually, a

Fleet Capital Corporation, as agent for such Lender, or at such other place in
the United States of America as the holder of this Note may designate from time

available funds, at the time of payment, the principal sum of
_________________________ Dollars ($ ), or such lesser principal amount as may
be outstanding pursuant to the Loan Agreement together with interest from and
after the date hereof on the unpaid principal balance outstanding from time to
time.

         This Secured Promissory Note (the "Note") is one of the Acquisition
Notes referred to in, and is issued pursuant to, that certain Loan and Security
Agreement dated as of October 30, 1998 by and among Borrowers, the lenders
signatories thereto (including Lender) and Fleet Capital Corporation ("FCC") as
Agent for said lenders (FCC in such capacity "Agent") (as amended from time to
time, the "Loan Agreement"), and is entitled to all of the benefits and security
of the Loan Agreement. All of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Loan
Agreement and the Security Documents are hereby made a part of this Note and are
deemed incorporated herein in full. All capitalized terms used herein, unless
otherwise specifically defined in this Note, shall have the meanings ascribed to

         For so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing the principal amount and accrued interest of this Note shall be due
and payable on the dates and in the manner hereinafter set forth:

                  (a) Interest on the unpaid principal balance outstanding from
         time to time shall be paid at such interest rates and at such times as
         are specified in the Loan Agreement;

                  (b) Principal shall be due and payable monthly commencing
         April 1, 2003, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter
         through and including October 1, 2003, in installments of $26,061.65;
         and

                  (c) The entire remaining principal amount then outstanding,

         In addition to the foregoing, immediately upon the receipt by any
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries of the amount necessary to constitute the
Liquidity Event and provided that no Suspension Event shall have occurred and be
continuing and all Contingent Liabilities have been settled and satisfied,
Borrower shall prepay this Acquisition Note in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of all Bridge Loan Advances made to Borrowers plus all accrued but unpaid
interest on the Bridge Loan Advances as of the date of such prepayment. All such
prepayments shall first be applied to the accrued but unpaid interest on the
Bridge Loan Advances and then in payment of the outstanding principal balance of
the Bridge Loan Advances in the inverse order of maturity.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire unpaid principal balance of
and accrued interest on this Note shall be due and payable immediately upon any
termination of the Loan Agreement pursuant to Section 4 thereof.

         This Note shall be subject to mandatory prepayment in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.3 of the Loan Agreement. Borrowers may also prepay
this Note in the manner provided in Section 4 of the Loan Agreement.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuation, of an Event of
Default, this Note shall or may, as provided in the Loan Agreement, and become
or be declared immediately due and payable.

         The right to receive principal of, and stated interest on, this Note
may only be transferred in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

         Demand, presentment, protest and notice of nonpayment and protest are
hereby waived by each Borrower.

         This Note amends, modifies and restates, but does not extinguish the
indebtedness evidenced by that certain Secured Promissory Note (Acquisition
Note) of Borrowers dated November 17, 1999, payable to the order of Lender in
the original principal amount of $6,000,000.00, which promissory note amended,
modified and restated that certain Secured Promissory Note (Acquisition Note) of
Borrowers dated October 30, 1998, payable to the order of Lender in the original
principal amount of $6,000,000.00.
