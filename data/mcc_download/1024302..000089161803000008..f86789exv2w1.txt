Return to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall sign and file (or shall cause

the such allocation as revised hereunder in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code and as agreed to by the Purchaser and Parent. Such allocation
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties for all purposes, and none of
the parties shall file any Tax Return or other document with, or make any
statement or declaration to, any Governmental Body that is inconsistent
therewith.

        1.6 CLOSING.

               (a) The closing of the sale of the Designated Assets to the

Section 11.14, as follows:

        2.1 SUBSIDIARIES; DUE ORGANIZATION; ETC.

               (a) Parent has no subsidiaries that own, license or use any
assets that constitute or that are used in, are needed for the conduct of or are
material to, or that otherwise relate to, the Enterprise Search Business, other
than Quiver, Ultraseek and Quiver Ltd. Each of Quiver and Ultraseek is a direct,
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Quiver Ltd. is a direct, wholly owned

               (b) Parent and Quiver are corporations duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; Ultraseek
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Israel. Each
Seller is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each of the jurisdictions
set forth opposite the name of such Seller in Part 2.1(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, and such jurisdictions constitute all of the jurisdictions where it
necessary for such Seller to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change.

        2.2 CERTIFICATES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. Parent has delivered to
the Purchaser accurate and complete copies of the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of the Sellers,
including all amendments thereto.

        2.3 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

               (a) Parent has delivered or made available to the Purchaser
accurate and complete copies of all registration statements, proxy statements
and other statements, reports, schedules, forms and other documents filed by
Parent with the SEC since January 1, 1999, and all amendments thereto (the
"Parent SEC Documents"). As of the time it was filed with the SEC, or if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact relating to the
Enterprise Search Business or omitted to state a material fact relating to the
Enterprise Search Business required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements relating to the Enterprise Search Business therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

               (b) The financial statements (including any related notes)
contained in the Parent SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto
relating to the Enterprise Search Business; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except

that the



                                       7.
<PAGE>

unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes); and (iii) fairly
present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries for the

footnotes); and (iii) fairly present the financial position of the Enterprise
Search Business as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations of the Enterprise Search Business for the periods covered thereby
(subject to normally recurring audit adjustments which are not material either
individually or in the aggregate). The consolidated statements of operations
included in the Unaudited Enterprise Search Business Financial Statements do not
collectively reflect revenues in excess of $125,000 in the aggregate derived
from third parties in which any of the Parent Entities holds, or has held at any
time, any equity interest.

               (d) The Audited Enterprise Search Business Financial Statements
when delivered to the Purchaser: (i) will have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP (except that they may not contain footnotes); and (ii) will fairly present
the financial position of the Enterprise Search Business as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Enterprise Search Business for the periods covered thereby. The consolidated
statements of operations to be included in the Audited Enterprise Search
Business Financial Statements will not collectively reflect revenues in excess
of $125,000 in the aggregate derived from third parties in which any of the
Parent Entities holds, or has held at any time, any equity interest.

        2.4 ABSENCE OF CHANGES.

               (a) Since September 30, 2002, there has not been any Material
        Adverse Change.

        no Parent Entity sold or otherwise transferred, or leased or licensed,
        any of the Covered Assets to any other Person outside the ordinary

               (f) From September 30, 2002 until the date of this Agreement, no

        no Parent Entity forgave any material debt or otherwise released or
        waived any right or claim material to such Parent Entity relating to the
        Enterprise Search Business or under any Contract that constitutes a
        Covered Asset.

               (i) From September 30, 2002 through the date of this Agreement,

        to take any of the actions referred to in clauses "(c)" through "(h)"
        above.

under any Outbound License Agreement identified in Part 2.8(a)(iv) of the
Disclosure Schedule).

        2.6 SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS. The Covered Assets collectively constitute,
as of the date hereof, and the Designated Assets and the Licensed IP will
collectively constitute, as of the Closing Date, all of the properties, rights,
interests and other tangible and intangible assets necessary to enable the
Purchaser to conduct the Enterprise Search Business in the manner in which the
Enterprise Search Business is currently being conducted by the Parent Entities.

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar
laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (2)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity). Upon the execution and delivery of the
other Transactional Agreements at the Closing, each of such other Transactional
Agreements to which it is a party will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by
(1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights

of time) (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Purchaser or any of its
affiliates, (ii) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of, or give
any Governmental Body or other Person the right to challenge any of the
Transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under, any Legal
Requirement or any Order to which the Purchaser or any of its affiliates is
subject, or (iii) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach
of any Contract except as would not be reasonably expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Purchaser or to prevent the consummation of the
Transactions. The Purchaser was not, is not and will not be required to make any
filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any Consent from, any Person in
connection with the execution and delivery of any of the Transactional
Agreements or the consummation or performance of any of the Transactions.

        3.4 BROKERS. Except with respect to the Purchaser's arrangements with SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, Purchaser has not agreed or become obligated to
pay, or taken any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any
Person claiming to be entitled to receive, any brokerage commission, finder's
fee or similar commission or fee in connection with any of the Transactions.

        3.5 PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS. There is no pending Proceeding against the
Purchaser, and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, no Governmental Body has
threatened to commence any Proceeding against the Purchaser, that could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or making illegal any of
the Transactions (excluding any Proceeding commenced against the Purchaser
solely related to claims that this Agreement was not duly authorized by the
Sellers). No Order has been issued or otherwise put into effect with respect to
the Purchaser that, and no Governmental Body has threatened to issue any Order
(that does not relate to the due authorization of any of the Sellers to enter
into this Agreement) with respect to the Purchaser that if issued or otherwise
put into effect, (i) could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
the ability of the Purchaser to comply with or perform any covenant or
obligation of the Purchaser under any of the Transactional Agreements, or (ii)
could reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or making illegal
any of the Transactions (excluding for purposes of this sentence any Order
related solely to claims that this Agreement was not duly authorized by the
Sellers).

        3.6 FINANCIAL CAPABILITY. The Purchaser has immediately available cash

Representatives, and prepare and make available such documents and take such
other actions as any party may request in good faith, in connection with any

the Purchaser on the other hand, shall issue any such press release or make any
such statement or disclosure without the prior consent of the other party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by
applicable law. If either the Sellers on the one hand, or the Purchaser on the
other hand, is required to make any such public disclosure, the party required
to make the disclosure shall use its reasonable efforts to give the other party
prior notice and an opportunity to review the disclosure prior to the public

holding positions comparable to the positions being offered in such offers of
employment. It is understood and agreed that (A) the Purchaser shall have
complete discretion in determining what positions to offer those employees of
the Sellers to whom the Purchaser elects to extend offers of employment, (B) the
Purchaser's expressed intention to extend offers of employment to such employees
shall not constitute any commitment, Contract understanding (expressed or
implied) or obligation on the part of the Purchaser to a post-Closing Date
employment relationship of any fixed term or duration or upon any terms or
conditions other than those that the Purchaser may establish pursuant to
individual offers of employment, and (C) employment offered by the Purchaser is
"at will" and may be terminated by the Purchaser or by the employee at any time,
with or without cause or advance notice (subject to any written agreements to
the contrary made between the Purchaser and the employee). Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of the
Purchaser to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any Continuing Employee

duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, compensation or terms or
conditions of employment of any Continuing Employee.

all requirements and obligations imposed under applicable Contracts (including
notice and dismissal requirements and severance obligations) in connection with
the termination of the employment of the Continuing Employees and the Separating
Employees. With respect to Separating Employees located outside the United
States, the Sellers shall make a good faith effort to negotiate and obtain from
such Separating Employees release of claims agreements or similar agreements
that are enforceable in the respective jurisdictions in which such Separating
Employees are located. Any and all obligations arising out of or relating to
such agreements shall be the sole obligation of the Sellers both before and
after the Closing Date.

               (d) The Purchaser shall have no obligation with respect to
payments of salary, compensation, wages, health or similar benefits,
commissions, bonuses (deferred or otherwise), severance, accrued vacation,
accrued sick leave, stock or stock options or any other sums or benefits due to
any Continuing Employee that accrued before the date that such Continuing
Employee commences his employment with the Purchaser (such Continuing Employee's
"Start Date"), including any payments accruing due to the consummation of the
Transactions. The Sellers shall be fully responsible for all amounts owing to
each Continuing Employee as a result of his employment prior to such Continuing
Employee's Start Date. The Sellers shall pay each Continuing Employee all wages
owed and the accrued but unused vacation of such Continuing Employee, in
accordance with and to the extent applicable under the Sellers' standard
employment policies and procedures and applicable law, upon termination of
employment with the applicable Parent Entity. The Parent Entities shall have no
obligation with respect to payments of salary, compensation, wages, health or
similar benefits, commissions, bonuses (deferred or otherwise), severance,
accrued vacation, accrued sick leave, stock or stock options or any other sums
or benefits due to any Continuing Employee from the Purchaser that arise solely
by reason of such Continuing Employee's employment by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall be fully responsible for all amounts owing to each Continuing
Employee from the Purchaser as a result of his employment on or after such
Continuing Employee's Start Date

               (e) The Sellers shall retain or assume responsibility for
providing health care coverage to all current or former employees of any of the
Parent Entities (or any individual who constitutes a qualified beneficiary under
Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") with respect to any current or former
employee of any Parent Entity) (without regard to whether such employees become
Continuing Employees) who are receiving (or become entitled to receive)
continuation health coverage pursuant to an election made under COBRA or
Sections 601-608 of ERISA relating to a qualifying event occurring prior to or
on the Closing Date.

and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax returns, and
making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax return. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall
retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Designated

               (b) All real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar
ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Designated Assets for a
taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between the
Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date based on the number of days of
such taxable period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period")
and the number of days of such taxable period after the Closing Date (with
respect to any such taxable period, the "Post-Closing Tax Period"). The Sellers
shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Purchaser shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax
Period. Upon receipt of any bill for real or personal property Taxes relating to
the Designated Assets, each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall present a

of such statement. In the event that either the Sellers or the Purchaser shall
make any other payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this
Section 5.8(b), the other party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no
event later than 20 days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is entitled along with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement. Any payment required under this Section 5.8 and not made within
20 days of delivery of the relevant statement shall bear interest at the rate
per annum determined in Section 1.2(c), for each day until paid.

<PAGE>
        the Purchaser shall be entitled to validly terminate this Agreement
        under this Section 8.1(d) on account of any inaccuracy described in the

        Notice has been withdrawn in its entirety (the "Parent Breach Withdrawal
        Notice"); or

               (e) by Parent if (i) any of the Purchaser's representations and
        warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the
        date of this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date
        subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set

        Purchaser's representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to
        the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by the Purchaser is
        curable by the Purchaser and the Purchaser cures such inaccuracy or
        breach within 10 days after receiving notice of such inaccuracy or
        breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section
        8.1(e) on account of such inaccuracy or breach, and provided, further,
        that in the event that at any time during the Pre-Closing Period the
        Purchaser provides Parent with a written notice (the "Purchaser Breach
        Notice") (i) stating that one or more representations and warranties of
        the Purchaser contained in this Agreement and identified in such notice

        circumstances of such inaccuracy, and (iii) confirming unequivocally
        that the Sellers are entitled to validly terminate this Agreement under

        entitled to validly terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e)
        on account of any inaccuracy described in the Purchaser Breach Notice,
        but may only terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) on
        account of any such inaccuracy if Parent delivers to the Purchaser the
        written notice described in Section 8.2 with respect to such inaccuracy
        prior to the earlier of (A) the date ten business days after Parent
        receives the Purchaser Breach Notice, or (B) the delivery by the
        Purchaser to Parent of a written notice (x) stating that each inaccuracy
        that was the subject of the applicable Purchaser Breach Notice has been
        cured, (y) describing in reasonable detail the circumstances of such
        cure, and (z) stating that such Purchaser Breach Notice has been
        withdrawn in its entirety (the "Purchaser Breach Withdrawal Notice").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e):
(1) in no event shall the delivery of a Parent Breach Notice, or the failure of
the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement on account of the matters described
therein, be deemed to limit in any way the indemnification rights of any of the
Purchaser Indemnitees hereunder; (2) in no event shall the delivery of a
Purchaser Breach Notice, or the failure of Parent to terminate this Agreement on
account of the matters described therein, be deemed to limit in any way the
indemnification


                                      39.
<PAGE>

rights of any of the Seller Indemnitees hereunder; (3) a Parent Breach
Withdrawal Notice shall constitute a complete withdrawal and repudiation of any
Parent Breach Notice described in such Parent Breach Withdrawal Notice, such
Parent Breach Withdrawal Notice shall thereupon have no further force and
effect, and the Purchaser shall thereupon be free to act as if such Parent
Breach Notice had never been received (including with respect to the Purchaser's
termination rights hereunder); and (4) a Purchaser Breach Withdrawal Notice
shall constitute a complete withdrawal and repudiation of any Purchaser Breach
Notice described in such Purchaser Breach Withdrawal Notice, such Purchaser
Breach Withdrawal Notice shall thereupon have no further force and effect, and
Parent shall thereupon be free to act as if such Purchaser Breach Notice had
never been received (including with respect to Parent's termination rights
hereunder). In no event shall the failure of the Purchaser to respond to a
Parent Breach Withdrawal Notice, or the failure of Parent to respond to a
Purchaser Breach Withdrawal Notice, be in any way deemed to be an admission or
agreement by the Purchaser or Parent (as the case may be) that any inaccuracy
described in the related Parent Breach Notice or Purchase Breach Notice has in
fact been cured or otherwise no longer exists, or otherwise limit any right of
Parent or the Purchaser (as the case may be) to terminate this Agreement on
account of such inaccuracy.

after the Closing Date, and (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Sellers set forth in Sections 2.5, 2.13 and 2.16 shall survive the Closing for
an indefinite period of time, without limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate
pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to a specific claim, if a
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the alleged breach or inaccuracy
thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the
party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time, and shall
survive until such time as each and every claim that is based directly or
indirectly upon, or that relates directly or indirectly to, any breach or
alleged breach or inaccuracy or alleged inaccuracy of such representation or
warranty has been fully and finally resolved, either by means of a written
settlement agreement executed on behalf of Parent and the Purchaser or by means
of a final, non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

               (d) The covenants of the Sellers set forth in Sections 4.4, 4.5,
4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10, and the covenants of the Sellers and the Purchaser
set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.6, shall not survive the Closing Date.
All of the remaining covenants of the Sellers and the Purchaser that by their
terms are to be performed or complied with entirely at or prior to the Closing
shall expire on the date 18 months after the Closing Date. The covenants of the
Sellers and the Purchaser that by their terms are to be performed or complied
with after the Closing shall survive the Closing for an indefinite period of
time, without limitation. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, any covenant in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the
time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding provisions
of this Section 9.1(d) with respect to a specific claim, if a written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the alleged breach thereof giving rise to such
right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time, and shall survive until such time as
each and every claim that is based directly or indirectly upon, or that relates
directly or indirectly to, any breach or alleged breach of such covenant has
been fully and finally resolved, either by means of a written settlement
agreement executed on behalf of Parent and the Purchaser or by means of a final,
non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

               (a) From and after the Closing, the Sellers, jointly and
severally, shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Purchaser Indemnitees

Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees or to which any of the

               (b) None of the Sellers shall be required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for any breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have been
suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Purchaser Indemnitees (including
the Damages arising from such breach or inaccuracy and all other Damages arising
from any other breaches or inaccuracies of any representations or warranties of
the Sellers, and solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(b) without giving
effect to any materiality qualifications or similar qualifications contained in
any of the representations or warranties made by the Sellers in this Agreement
in determining whether any of such representations or warranties has been
breached or is inaccurate for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
arising from any such breach or inaccuracy for purposes of Section 9.2(a)(i))
exceeds $200,000 (the "Seller Threshold Amount"). Subject to Section 9.2(c), in
the event that the Seller Threshold Amount is satisfied, the Sellers shall be
required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for
any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the Sellers
set forth in this Agreement to the extent that the aggregate amount of the
Damages exceeds the Seller Threshold Amount, giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Change qualifications or similar qualifications contained in
any of the representations or warranties made by the Sellers in this Agreement
in determining whether any of such representations or warranties has been
breached.

               (c) The total amount of the indemnification payments that the
Sellers shall be required to make pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for any
inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties of the Sellers set
forth in this Agreement shall be limited in the aggregate to $10,000,000;
provided, however, that (i) the total amount of such indemnification payments in
connection with any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in clauses "(a)" through "(t)" of Section 2.8 and the Specified IP
Representations and Warranties shall be limited in the aggregate to $20,000,000,
and (ii) the total amount of such indemnification payments in connection with
any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.5, 2.13 and 2.16 shall be limited in the aggregate to $25,000,000.
Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the Sellers be required to
make indemnification payments pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for any inaccuracy
or breach of the representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in this
Agreement in excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate.

        9.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER.

               (a) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall hold harmless
and indemnify each of the Seller Indemnitees from and against, and shall
compensate and reimburse each of the Seller Indemnitees for, any Damages that
are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Seller Indemnitees
or to which any of the Seller Indemnitees may otherwise become subject at any
time (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party claim)
and that arise directly or indirectly from or as a direct or indirect result of,
or are directly or indirectly connected with:

                      (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of (A) any of the
        representations or warranties made by the Purchaser in this Agreement as
        of the date of this Agreement;



                                      43.

<PAGE>

        or (B) any of the representations or warranties made by the Purchaser in
        this Agreement as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the
        Closing Date, and any Proceeding relating directly or indirectly to any
        such breach or inaccuracy;

                      (ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the
        Purchaser contained in this Agreement;

                      (iii) the failure of the Purchaser to perform or discharge
        any of the Designated Contractual Obligations;

                      (iv) the operation by the Purchaser of the Enterprise
        Search Business following the Closing Date; provided, however, that in
        no event shall the indemnity described in this paragraph (iv) be deemed
        to apply with respect to (A) any matter, event or circumstance existing
        or occurring or otherwise relating to the period on or prior to Closing
        Date (provided that any Damages that result from the Purchaser's failure
        to mitigate damages to the extent required by Legal Requirement or
        Contract or from action by the Purchaser that exacerbates such matter,
        event or circumstance shall not be deemed to be covered by this clause
        "(A)"), (B) any matter, event or circumstance with respect to which the
        Sellers would be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to any
        provision of Section 9.2 (ignoring any thresholds, deductibles and caps
        on such indemnification for this purpose) or (C) any Damages that do not
        relate to any third-party claim brought against the Seller Indemnitees
        following the Closing Date; or

                      (v) any Proceeding relating directly or indirectly to any
        inaccuracy, breach, alleged inaccuracy or breach, Liability or matter of
        the type referred to in clauses "(ii)," "(iii)" or "(iv)" above
        (including any Proceeding commenced by any Seller Indemnitee for the
        purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this Section 9).

               (b) The Purchaser shall not be required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) for any breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have been
suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Seller Indemnitees (including the
Damages arising from such breach or inaccuracy and all other Damages arising
from any other breaches or inaccuracies of any representations or warranties of
the Purchaser, and solely for purposes of this Section 9.3(b) without giving
effect to any materiality qualifications or similar qualifications contained in
any of the representations or warranties made by the Purchaser in this Agreement
in determining whether any of such representations or warranties has been
breached or is inaccurate for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
arising from any such breach or inaccuracy for purposes of Section 9.3(a)(i))
exceeds $200,000 (the "Purchaser Threshold Amount"). Subject to Section 9.3(c),
in the event that the Purchaser Threshold Amount is satisfied, the Purchaser
shall be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section
9.3(a)(i) for any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement to the extent that the aggregate
amount of the Damages exceeds the Purchaser Threshold Amount, giving effect to
any materiality qualifications or similar qualifications contained in any of the
representations or warranties made by the



                                      44.
<PAGE>

Purchaser in this Agreement in determining whether any of such representations
or warranties has been breached.

               (c) In no event shall the Purchaser be required to make
indemnification payments pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) for any inaccuracy or
breach of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate.

        9.4 SETOFF. The Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and deduct
any sum that may be owed to any Purchaser Indemnitee under this Section 9 from
the Deferred Payment Amount. Prior to withholding or deducting any sum from the
Deferred Payment Amount pursuant to this Section 9.4, the Purchaser will notify
Parent in writing of its intention to withhold or deduct such sum and the
circumstances giving rise to such withholding or deduction, whereupon Parent
shall have ten days to review such notice. If at the end of such ten-day period
Parent does not respond to such notice, then the Purchaser shall be entitled to
such deduction or withholding as stated in the notice. If during the ten-day
period Parent disputes the claim underlying the Purchaser's intention to
withhold or deduct a sum from the Deferred Payment Amount, then the Purchaser
shall retain the sum stated in such notice in the Deferred Payment Account until
the validity of the claim is finally resolved, either by means of a written
settlement agreement executed on behalf of Parent and the Purchaser or by means
of a final, non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing, a valid withholding and deduction of any such
sum shall operate for all purposes as a complete discharge (to the extent of
such sum) of the obligation to pay the amount from which such sum was withheld
and deducted and a release of the Sellers from further liability with respect to
such obligation to the extent of such setoff.

        9.5 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST PURCHASER INDEMNITEES.

               (a) If (1) the Purchaser receives written notice of the
commencement of any Proceeding against the Purchaser or against any other
Purchaser Indemnitee, and (2) a claim for indemnification is to be made against
any of the Sellers under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding, then
the Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent of the commencement of such
Proceeding; provided, however, that any failure to notify Parent of the
commencement of such Proceeding shall not limit or otherwise affect any
liability that any of the Sellers may have to any Purchaser Indemnitee (except
to the extent that the defense of such Proceeding has been materially prejudiced
by the Purchaser's failure to notify Parent of the commencement of such
Proceeding). If, within ten days after receiving notification of the
commencement of any such Proceeding, Parent delivers to the Purchaser a written
notice setting forth the election of Parent to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, then, subject to subsections "(b)" and "(c)" below:

                      (i) Parent shall be entitled to assume the defense of such
        Proceeding, at the sole expense of the Sellers, with reputable counsel
        reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser; and

                      (ii) as long as Parent conducts such defense, the Sellers
        shall not be required to reimburse any Purchaser Indemnitee for any fees
        paid to any other counsel



                                      45.
<PAGE>

        representing such Purchaser Indemnitee in such Proceeding for legal
        services rendered while Parent is conducting such defense (it being
        understood that Parent shall be required to reimburse the Purchaser
        Indemnitees for any fees paid to counsel representing any of the
        Purchaser Indemnitees in such Proceeding for legal services rendered
        prior to the time the Purchaser receives notice of the election of
        Parent to assume such defense).

               (b) If Parent assumes the defense of a Proceeding in accordance
with subsection "(a)" above, then:

                      (i) it will be deemed conclusively established for
        purposes of this Agreement that all claims made in such Proceeding are
        within the scope of and are subject to the indemnification provisions
        set forth in Section 9.2, and Parent shall not be permitted to contest
        the applicability of Section 9.2 to such Proceeding or to contest the
        Sellers' obligation to provide indemnification with respect thereto;

                      (ii) Parent shall keep the Purchaser informed of all
        material developments relating to such Proceeding;

                      (iii) the Purchaser and each of the other Purchaser
        Indemnitees shall be entitled to participate (at their own expense) in
        the defense of such Proceeding; and

                      (iv) Parent shall not be permitted to effect any
        settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Proceeding or any of the
        claims made in connection therewith unless (A) such settlement,
        adjustment or compromise involves no finding or admission of any breach
        by any Purchaser Indemnitee of any obligation to any other Person or any
        violation by any Purchaser Indemnitee of any Legal Requirement, (B) such
        settlement, adjustment or compromise has no effect on any other claim
        that may be made against any Purchaser Indemnitee and (C) the sole
        relief provided in connection with such settlement, adjustment or
        compromise is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Sellers.

If Parent does not elect (within the ten-day time period specified in subsection
"(a)" above) to assume the defense of a Proceeding in accordance with subsection
"(a)" above, then (I) the Purchaser shall have the exclusive right, at its
election, to control the defense of such Proceeding (at the Sellers' sole
expense and with counsel selected by the Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory
to Parent), and (II) the Sellers will be bound by any judgment entered or any
determination made in such Proceeding and by any settlement, adjustment or
compromise effected by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to such Proceeding.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 9.5, and notwithstanding any election made by Parent to assume the
defense of any Proceeding in accordance with subsection "(a)" above, the
Purchaser may (by notifying Parent) elect to assume, and shall have the
exclusive right to control, the defense of any Proceeding of the type referred
to in subsection "(a)" above (at the Sellers' sole expense and with reputable
counsel selected by the Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory to Parent) if:



                                      46.
<PAGE>

                      (i) any of the Sellers or any affiliate of any of the
        Sellers is also a party to such Proceeding, and counsel to the Purchaser
        determines in good faith that joint representation would give rise to a
        conflict of interest or would otherwise be inappropriate in such
        Proceeding; or

                      (ii) such Proceeding relates directly or indirectly to any
        failure or alleged failure on the part of the Purchaser to pay any Tax
        when due or to comply with any Legal Requirement relating to Taxes;

provided, however, that the Sellers will not be bound by any settlement,
adjustment or compromise of such Proceeding or of any of the claims made in
connection therewith that is effected without the consent of Parent (which may
not be unreasonably withheld by Parent).

        9.6 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST SELLER INDEMNITEES.

               (a) If (1) any Seller receives written notice of the commencement
of any Proceeding against such Seller or against any other Seller Indemnitee,
and (2) a claim for indemnification is to be made against the Purchaser under
this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding, then such Seller shall promptly
notify the Purchaser of the commencement of such Proceeding; provided, however,
that any failure to notify the Purchaser of the commencement of such Proceeding
shall not limit or otherwise affect any liability that the Purchaser may have to
any Seller Indemnitee (except to the extent that the defense of such Proceeding
has been materially prejudiced by such Seller's failure to notify the Purchaser
of the commencement of such Proceeding). If, within ten days after receiving
notification of the commencement of any such Proceeding, the Purchaser delivers
to Parent a written notice setting forth the election of the Purchaser to assume
the defense of such Proceeding, then, subject to subsections "(b)" and "(c)"
below:

                      (i) the Purchaser shall be entitled to assume the defense
        of such Proceeding, at the sole expense of the Purchaser, with reputable
        counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent; and

                      (ii) as long as the Purchaser conducts such defense, the
        Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse any Seller Indemnitee for
        any fees paid to any other counsel representing such Seller Indemnitee
        in such Proceeding for legal services rendered while the Purchaser is
        conducting such defense (it being understood that the Purchaser shall be
        required to reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for any fees paid to
        counsel representing any of the Seller Indemnitees in such Proceeding
        for legal services rendered prior to the time Parent receives notice of
        the election of the Purchaser to assume such defense).

               (b) If the Purchaser assumes the defense of a Proceeding in
accordance with subsection "(a)" above, then:

                      (i) it will be deemed conclusively established for
        purposes of this Agreement that all claims made in such Proceeding are
        within the scope of and are subject to the indemnification provisions
        set forth in Section 9.3, and the Purchaser shall



                                      47.
<PAGE>

        not be permitted to contest the applicability of Section 9.3 to such
        Proceeding or to contest the Purchaser's obligation to provide
        indemnification with respect thereto;

                      (ii) the Purchaser shall keep Parent informed of all
        material developments relating to such Proceeding;

                      (iii) Parent and each of the other Seller Indemnitees
        shall be entitled to participate (at their own expense) in the defense
        of such Proceeding; and

                      (iv) the Purchaser shall not be permitted to effect any
        settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Proceeding or any of the
        claims made in connection therewith unless (A) such settlement,
        adjustment or compromise involves no finding or admission of any breach
        by any Seller Indemnitee of any obligation to any other Person or any
        violation by any Seller Indemnitee of any Legal Requirement, (B) such
        settlement, adjustment or compromise has no effect on any other claim
        that may be made against any Seller Indemnitee and (C) the sole relief
        provided in connection with such settlement, adjustment or compromise is
        monetary damages that are paid in full by the Purchaser.

If the Purchaser does not elect (within the ten-day time period specified in
subsection "(a)" above) to assume the defense of a Proceeding in accordance with
subsection "(a)" above, then (I) Parent shall have the exclusive right, at its
election, to control the defense of such Proceeding (at the Purchaser's sole
expense and with counsel selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser), and (II) the Purchaser will be bound by any judgment entered or any
determination made in such Proceeding and by any settlement, adjustment or
compromise effected by any Seller Indemnitee with respect to such Proceeding.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 9.6, and notwithstanding any election made by the Purchaser to assume
the defense of any Proceeding in accordance with subsection "(a)" above, Parent
may (by notifying the Purchaser) elect to assume, and shall have the exclusive
right to control, the defense of any Proceeding of the type referred to in
subsection "(a)" above (at the Purchaser's sole expense and with reputable
counsel selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser) if the
Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser is also a party to such Proceeding,
and counsel to Parent determines in good faith that joint representation would
give rise to a conflict of interest or would otherwise be inappropriate in such
Proceeding; provided, however, that the Purchaser will not be bound by any
settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Proceeding or of any of the claims
made in connection therewith that is effected without the consent of the
Purchaser (which may not be unreasonably withheld by the Purchaser).

        9.7 EXERCISE OF REMEDIES BY INDEMNITEES OTHER THAN THE PURCHASER AND
PARENT. No Purchaser Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor
thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification
claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless the Purchaser (or
any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion
of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy, and no
Seller Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to



                                      48.
<PAGE>

assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have
consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such
other remedy.

        9.8 ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE. Any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this Section 9 shall be treated, to the extent permitted or required
by law, by all parties as an adjustment to the purchase price for the Designated
Assets.

        9.9 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. If the Closing occurs, then the provisions
of this Section 9 shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to any party in respect of any breach by any other party of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, or any Damages suffered
or incurred by any party, except with respect to claims arising out of fraud or
the willful breach of covenants by the other party; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit any party from seeking an injunction or other
equitable relief in respect thereof.

10.     CERTAIN POST-CLOSING COVENANTS.

        10.1 FURTHER ACTIONS.

               (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cooperate
with the Purchaser and the Purchaser's affiliates and Representatives, and shall
execute and deliver such documents and take such other actions as the Purchaser
may reasonably request, for the purpose of evidencing the Transactions and
putting the Purchaser in possession and control of all of the Designated Assets
and Licensed IP, and the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller and the
Sellers' affiliates and Representatives, and shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such other actions as Parent may reasonably request, for the
purpose of evidencing the Transactions and effecting the assumption by Purchaser
of the Designated Contractual Obligations. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall promptly remit
to the Purchaser any funds that are received by the Sellers and that are
included in, or that represent payment of receivables included in, the
Designated Assets.

               (b) If, in the case of any Enterprise Search Contract or Non-IP
Contract, a Consent identified in Part 6.3 of the Disclosure Schedule has not
yet been obtained (or otherwise is not in full force and effect) as of the
Closing, the Purchaser may waive the closing condition set forth in Section 6.3
as to such Consent and elect to have such Enterprise Search Contract or Non-IP
Contract treated in accordance with the remainder of this paragraph. Neither
this Agreement nor any other Transactional Agreement shall constitute a sale,
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an attempted sale,
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery, of any Enterprise
Search Contract or Non-IP Contract as to which such a required Consent has not
been obtained as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, until any
such Consent is obtained, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with
each other, and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their Representatives to cooperate, in any lawful arrangement designed to
provide the Purchaser with the benefits of such Enterprise Search Contract or
Non-IP Contract, subject to the obligations



                                      49.
<PAGE>

under such Enterprise Search Contract or Non-IP Contract, at no cost to the
Purchaser in excess of the cost the Purchaser would have incurred (without
modification of the terms of such Enterprise Search Contract or Non-IP Contract)
if such Consent had been obtained prior to the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to any Enterprise Search Contract providing for the
provision of routine software maintenance services to unaffiliated third parties
in the ordinary course of business that is not assigned to the Purchaser at the
Closing, at the election of Parent, Parent shall engage the Purchaser on a
subcontractor basis to perform (and the Purchaser hereby agrees to perform) such
routine software maintenance services under such Enterprise Search Contract (but
the Purchaser shall have no obligation to perform any other services that may
also be provided for in any such Enterprise Search Contract). In consideration
for such performance, Parent shall assign to the Purchaser all rights to receive
payments for such routine software maintenance services under any such
non-assigned Enterprise Search Contract from and after the Closing. Following
the Closing, the parties will use reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent not
identified in Part 5.2 of the Disclosure Schedule (other than Designated
Consents) that has not been obtained as of the Closing Date. If a required
Consent not obtained as of the Closing Date is subsequently obtained, the
Enterprise Search Contract or Non-IP Contract subject to such Consent shall be
deemed an Assumed Contract as of the date such Consent is effective.

        10.2 CONFIDENTIALITY. Without limiting the generality of anything
contained in Section 5.4, the Sellers shall ensure that, on and at all times
after the Closing Date, the Parent Entities keep strictly confidential, except
as required by law, and do not use or disclose to any third party, any
confidential or proprietary information directly relating to the Enterprise
Search Business.

payable to Credit Suisse First Boston) that have been incurred or that are in

               (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.1(b), in the
event that (i) Parent's representation and warranty in the last sentence of
Section 2.16(b) of this Agreement is inaccurate or becomes inaccurate as of any
date during the Pre-Closing Period (as if made on any such date), (ii) (x)
Parent fails to take all commercially reasonable steps to properly seek and
validly obtain the approval described in such last sentence of Section 2.16(b)
as promptly as reasonably practicable, or (y) such approval is not obtained by
January 31, 2003, or (z) such approval is formally sought and rejected or
otherwise not obtained at the time such approval is formally sought, and (iii)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(c) or
Section 8.1(d), then not later than two (2) business days following such
termination, Parent shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to $1,200,000.

        11.2 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action or other Proceeding relating
to any of the Transactional Agreements or the enforcement of any provision of
any of the Transactional Agreements is brought against any party to this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to
which the prevailing party may be entitled).

        11.3 NOTICES. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

registered mail, by courier or express delivery service, electronic mail or by
facsimile) to the address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the
name of such party below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number

<PAGE>

        11.7 GOVERNING LAW; VENUE.

               (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of California
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

               (b) Any legal action or other Proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement shall be brought
or otherwise commenced only in any state or federal court located in the County
of Santa Clara, California. Each party to this Agreement:

                      (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the
        jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in the County of
        Santa Clara, California (and each appellate court located in the State
        of California) in connection with any such Proceeding;

                      (ii) agrees that each state and federal court located in
        the County of Santa Clara, California shall be deemed to be a convenient
        forum; and

                      (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense
        or otherwise), in any such Proceeding commenced in any state or federal
        court located in the County of Santa Clara, California, any claim that
        such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
        that such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
        venue of such proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the
        subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such
        court.

               (c) The Sellers agree that, if any Proceeding is commenced
against any Purchaser Indemnitee by any Person in or before any court or other
tribunal anywhere in the world, then such Purchaser Indemnitee may proceed
against any of the Sellers in or before such court or other tribunal with
respect to any indemnification claim or other claim arising directly or
indirectly from or relating directly or indirectly to such Proceeding or any of
the matters alleged therein or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.

        11.8 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTIES IN INTEREST.

               (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon: each of the Sellers and
their respective successors and assigns (if any); and the Purchaser and its
successors and assigns (if any). This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
the Sellers, the Purchaser, the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees
(subject to Section 9.7) and the respective successors and assigns (if any) of
the foregoing.

               (b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser may assign any or all of
its rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under
Section 9 and its right to receive and take possession of the Designated Assets)
and delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in
part, to any wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser without obtaining the
consent or approval of any other Person; provided, however, that in such event
the



                                      53.
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall guarantee to the Sellers the performance by such subsidiary of
all of its obligations hereunder and otherwise with respect to the Transactions.
Following the Closing, the Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights under
this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under Section 9), in whole
or in part, to any other Person without obtaining the consent or approval of any
other Person, but may not delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of Parent. None of the Sellers shall be
permitted to assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement without the Purchaser's prior written consent; provided, however,
that the Sellers may assign their rights under this Agreement to an acquiror of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent Entities, taken as a whole,
but the Sellers may not delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement
to any such acquiror or any other Person without the Purchaser's prior written
consent.

               (c) Except for the provisions of Section 9 hereof, none of the
provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to
any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns (if any). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) no employee of any of the Parent Entities shall have any rights
under this Agreement or under any of the other Transactional Agreements, and
(ii) no creditor of any of the Parent Entities shall have any rights under this
Agreement or any of the other Transactional Agreements.

        11.9 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be
cumulative (and not alternative). The parties agree that: (a) in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by any party of any covenant, obligation or
other provision set forth in this Agreement, the other parties shall be entitled
(in addition to any other remedy that may be available to them) to (i) seek an
Order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision, and (ii) seek an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach; and (b) no party shall
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
Order or injunction or in connection with any related action or Proceeding.

        11.10 WAIVER.

               (a) No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.

               (b) No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.



                                      54.

        11.11 AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered
or supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of the Purchaser and the Sellers.

        11.12 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

        11.13 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The Transactional Agreements set forth the
entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of the
parties relating to the subject matter thereof.

        11.14 DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered paragraphs in Section 2, and the
disclosure contained in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify
other paragraphs in Section 2 only to the extent that it would be readily
apparent from a reading of the disclosure that it is relevant to such other
paragraphs.

        11.15 KNOWLEDGE. For purposes of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be
deemed to have "knowledge" of a particular fact or other matter if one or more
of the individuals identified on Part 11.15 of the Disclosure Schedule has
actual knowledge of such fact or other matter. For purposes of this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall be deemed to have "knowledge" of a particular fact or other
matter if any executive officer or director of the Purchaser has actual
knowledge of such fact or other matter.

        11.16 CONSTRUCTION.

               (a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

               (b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the
effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not
be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

               (c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."
