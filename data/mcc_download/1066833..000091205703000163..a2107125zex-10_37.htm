<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Guaranty, Biovail irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the full and punctual performance to DOV of all obligations of Biovail Labs in or arising
out of or relating to the 2001 Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;On
April&nbsp;5, 2001, Biovail Labs filed its complaint in the Andrx Litigation. Biovail asserted that Andrx's generic version of the formulation of Tiazac approved
pursuant to NDA 20-401 infringed the DOV Patent. Andrx asserted counterclaims against Biovail Labs concerning the validity of the DOV Patent. Biovail Labs and Andrx dismissed their
respective claims in the Andrx Litigation, and entered into a mutual release, in June&nbsp;2002. Biovail has asserted that DOV is required to reimburse Biovail Labs pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.7 of
the 2001 Agreement for all legal costs and expenses incurred by Biovail Labs in connection with the patent infringement litigation against Andrx, up to a maximum of $1.5&nbsp;million. Biovail has
also asserted other claims against DOV arising under or relating to the 2001 Agreement and the DOV Patent. DOV has denied that it has any liability to Biovail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;On
July&nbsp;9, 2001, the FTC issued a Resolution Authorizing Use of Compulsory Process in a Non-Public Investigation in File
No.&nbsp;011-0094. Among other things, the nature and scope of the FTC investigation was to determine whether Biovail's acquisition of exclusive rights to the DOV Patent violated the
United States antitrust laws and whether Biovail, DOV, or any other person entered into the 2001 Agreement for the purpose of restricting entry into the generic market for any diltiazem-based
pharmaceutical product. DOV has asserted that Biovail is liable to indemnify DOV pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.1 of the 2001 Agreement for all damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' and professional fees and other expenses) resulting from the FTC investigation. DOV has also asserted other claims against Biovail arising under or relating to the 2001 Agreement and the
DOV Patent. Biovail has denied that it has any liability to DOV. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Parties have now agreed to terminate the 2001 Agreement, to resolve fully all disputes concerning their respective rights and obligations thereunder (including but
not limited to the claims
for reimbursement and indemnification asserted by Biovail Labs and DOV, respectively), and to resolve fully all other claims that any Party may have against another Party arising under or relating to
the 2001 Agreement or the DOV Patent. Further, Biovail Labs desires, and DOV has agreed to grant to Biovail Labs, the Limited Patent License. </FONT></P>
