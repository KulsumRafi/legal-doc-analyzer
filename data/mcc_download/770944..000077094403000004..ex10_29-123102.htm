&nbsp;&nbsp; The Executive shall be entitled to voluntarily terminate his
employment, which shall be treated as an involuntary termination of employment
by the Company without Cause, if during such two year period following a Change
of Control, without Executive&#146;s written consent, the Company or its successor:
(A) changes Executive&#146;s title or substantially changes his duties or functions
from those he previously performed under this Agreement, (B) reduces the
Executive&#146;s Annual Base Salary or his target Annual Bonus opportunity
percentage, or (C) requires the Executive to be based at any office or location
more than 35 miles from that provided in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof (other than for
reasonable travel required in connection with Executive&#146;s duties).</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp; If it shall be determined that any payment, distribution or benefit
received or to be received by the Executive from the Company pursuant to this
Agreement or any stock award or option plan maintained by Employer or its
affiliates (&#147;<U>Payments</U>&#148;) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;) (such tax referred to as the &#147;<U>Excise Tax</U>&#148;), then the
Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company
(the &#147;<U>Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment</U>&#148;) in an amount such that the net amount
retained by the Executive, after the calculation and deduction of any Excise Tax
on the Payments (together with any penalties and interest that have been or will
be imposed on the Executive in connection therewith) and any federal, state and
local income taxes, Excise Taxes and payroll taxes (including the tax imposed by
Section 3101(b) of the Code) on the Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment provided for in
this Section 5(c), shall be equal to the Payments. In computing the amount of
this payment, it shall be assumed that the Executive is subject to tax by each
taxing jurisdiction at the highest marginal tax rate in the respective taxing
jurisdiction of the Executive, taking into account the city and state in which
the Executive resides, but giving effect to the tax benefit, if any, which the
Executive may enjoy to the extent that any such tax is deductible in determining
the tax liability of any other taxing jurisdiction (provided that the highest
marginal tax rate for federal income tax purposes shall be determined under
Section 1 of the Code).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; All determinations required to be made under this Section 5(c),
including whether and when an Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment is required and the
amount of such Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in
arriving at such determination, except as specified in Section 5(c)(i), shall be
made by the Company&#146;s independent auditors (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;), in
consultation with the Executive, which Accounting Firm shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business
days after the Company makes any Payments to the Executive. The determination of
tax liability and the assumptions made by the Accounting Firm shall be subject
to review by the Executive&#146;s tax advisor, and, if the Executive&#146;s tax advisor
does not agree with the determination reached by the Accounting Firm, then the
Accounting Firm and the Executive&#146;s tax advisor shall jointly designate a
nationally-recognized public accounting firm within five (5) business days after
notice has been given to the Company of the Executive&#146;s disagreement with the
Accounting Firm&#146;s calculation, which shall make the determination within 15
business days after its appointment. If the parties cannot agree on a nationally
recognized public accounting firm, then both parties shall select a nationally
recognized public accounting firm who shall then jointly select a third
nationally recognized public accounting firm which shall make the determination
within 15 business days after its appointment. All fees and expenses of the
accountants and tax advisors retained by either the Executive or the Company
shall be borne by the Company. Any Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section 5(c), shall be paid by the Company to the Executive
within five (5) days after the receipt of the determination, subject to
applicable federal, state, local and Excise Tax withholding requirements. Any
determination by a jointly designated public accounting firm shall be binding
upon the Company and the Executive, and shall not be subject to arbitration
pursuant to Section 9, subject to the provisions of Section 5(c)(iii)
below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999
of the Code at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
that Excise Tax Gross-Up Payments will not have been made by the Company that
should have been made consistent with the calculations required to be made
hereunder (&#147;<U>Underpayment</U>&#148;). In the event that the IRS, on audit, asserts
that the Executive has made an underpayment and the Executive is required (by
reason of settlement or otherwise) to make a payment of any Excise Tax, or if
the Executive is required to make one or more payments of Excise Tax to the IRS
(and/or interest or penalties thereon) upon the filing of his original or
amended tax returns which exceed the amounts taken into account in determining
the initial Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment made pursuant to Section 5(c)(i) or
Section 5(c)(ii), then in either of such events any such Underpayment calculated
in accordance with and in the same manner as the Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment in
Section 5(c)(i) shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of
the Executive. In addition, the Company will pay the Executive an amount equal
to any penalties, interest or additions to be assessed against him as a result
of the underpayment, which amounts shall be grossed up for any federal, state,
local or Excise Taxes payable with respect to such penalties, interest or
additions to tax such that the Executive receives a net amount equal to the
penalties, interest and additions to tax assessed against him (determined in the
same manner as described in Section 5(c)(i). The Executive shall not be
obligated to contest any proposed assessment of any Underpayment and may settle
any such audit action or proceeding involving an Underpayment at his discretion;
<U>provided</U>, however, that the Executive shall, upon notice of examination
by the Internal Revenue Service, give notice thereof to the Company and the
Company, at its sole cost and in its sole discretion, may, on behalf of the
Executive, defend and contest against any proposed Internal Revenue Service
deficiency. In the event that the Company assumes the defense of the proposed
deficiency, the Company shall immediately, upon written request of the
Executive, secure all of its possible obligations to the Executive as provided
for in this Section 5(c)(iii) by either posting cash collateral in escrow or
providing the Executive with a &#147;clean irrevocable letter of credit&#148; in the
amount of all of the Company&#146;s possible obligations to the Executive pursuant to
this Section 5(c)(iii). The terms of such escrow or clean irrevocable letter of
credit shall be negotiated by the Company and the Executive at such time and any
dispute relating to such matters shall be settled in an arbitration pursuant to
Section 9 of this Agreement. The Executive agrees to execute any documents,
including Powers of Attorney, that may be necessary to facilitate the Company&#146;s
defense and/or contesting the Internal Revenue Service&#146;s assertions. In the
event that the Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment exceeds the amount subsequently
determined to be due, such excess shall constitute a loan from the Company to
the Executive payable on the fifth day after demand by the Company together with
interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Introduction</U>. The parties acknowledge that the provisions and covenants
contained in this Section 6 are ancillary and material to this Agreement and
that the limitations contained in this Agreement are reasonable in geographic
and temporal scope and do not impose a greater restriction or restraint than is
necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the
Company. The parties also acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
Section 6 do not adversely affect the Executive&#146;s ability to earn a living in
any capacity that does not violate the covenants contained herein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Confidential Information</U>. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of the Company and all of its subsidiaries,
partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies, and other affiliates
(collectively, the &#147;<U>BTFHC Group</U>&#148;), all secret or confidential
information, knowledge or data relating to the BTFHC Group, its franchisees, and
their businesses (including, without limitation, any proprietary and not
publicly available information concerning any processes, methods, trade secrets,
research, secret data, costs, names of users or purchasers of their respective
products or services, business methods, operating procedures or programs or
methods of promotion and sale) that the Executive has obtained or obtains during
the Executive&#146;s employment by the BTFHC Group and that is not public knowledge
(other than as a result of the Executive&#146;s violation of this Section 6(b))
(&#147;<U>Confidential Information</U>&#148;). The Executive shall not communicate,
divulge or disseminate Confidential Information at any time during or after the
Executive&#146;s employment with the BTFHC Group, except with prior written consent
of the applicable member of the BTFHC Group, or as otherwise required by law or
legal process. All records, files, memoranda, reports, customer lists, drawings,
plans, documents and the like that the Executive uses, prepares or comes into
contact with during the course of the Executive&#146;s employment shall remain the
sole property of the Company or the BTFHC Group, as applicable, and shall be
turned over to the applicable member of the BTFHC Group upon termination of the
Executive&#146;s employment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Non-Recruitment</U>. For purposes of this agreement, the &#147;<U>Restricted
Period</U>&#148; means the period of the Executive&#146;s employment with the BTFHC Group
and the period following the Executive&#146;s Date of Termination (i) of the
unexpired time of the Employment Period if the Executive&#146;s Date of Termination
occurs before January 1, 2005 and before (and not in connection with) a Change
in Control or (ii) of one year in all other cases. The Executive shall not, at
any time during the Restricted Period, without the prior written consent of the
Company, directly or indirectly, contact, solicit, recruit, or employ (whether
as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor)
any person who was or is at any time during the previous twelve (12) months an
employee, representative, officer or director of the BTFHC Group. Further,
during the Restricted Period, Executive shall not take any action that could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of encouraging or inducing any
employee, representative, officer or director of the BTFHC Group to cease their
relationship with the BTFHC Group for any reason.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>No Competition</U>. During the  Restricted  Period,  the  Executive  shall not invest in
(other than in a publicly traded company with a maximum investment of no more
than 1% of outstanding shares), consult, advise, or be otherwise engaged or
employed by, any Competitor. A &#147;<U>Competitor</U>&#148; means any entity or
enterprise that competes with the BTFHC Group through the operation of health or
fitness clubs or any other business engaged in competition within five (5) miles
of any health or fitness facility, or other business, which on the Date of
Termination is owned, managed or under development to be owned or managed by the
BTFHC Group or is owned by a franchisee of the BTFHC Group.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Assistance to Company</U>. The Executive agrees that, following termination
of employment for any reason, the Executive shall assist and cooperate with the
Company with regard to any matter or project in which the Executive was involved
during the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, including but not limited to
any litigation that may be pending or arise after such termination of
employment. Further, the Executive agrees to notify the Company at the earliest
opportunity of any contact that is made by any third parties concerning any such
matter or project. The Company shall not unreasonably request such cooperation
of Executive and shall compensate the Executive for any lost wages or expenses
associated with such cooperation and assistance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Acknowledgement and Enforcement</U>. The Executive acknowledges and agrees
that:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; the purpose of the foregoing covenants, including without
limitation the noncompetition covenant of Section 6(d) is to protect the
goodwill, trade secrets and other Confidential Information of the BTFHC
Group;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; because of the nature of the business in which the BTFHC Group is
engaged and because of the nature of the Confidential Information to which the
Executive has access, the BTFHC Group would suffer irreparable harm and it would
be impractical and excessively difficult to determine the actual damages of the
BTFHC Group in the event the Executive breached any of the covenants of this
Section 6; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; remedies at law (such as monetary damages) for any breach of the
Executive&#146;s obligations under this Section 6 would be inadequate.</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Executive therefore agrees and consents that if the Executive commits any
breach of a covenant under this Section 6 or threatens to commit any such
breach, the Company shall have the right (in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without
posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual
damage; <U>provided</U>, in the case of a breach of the noncompetition covenant
of Section 6(d): (A) such injunctive relief shall be available only for a breach
occurring during Executive&#146;s employment and for one year following the Date
of Termination of Executive&#146;s employment and (B) without limiting any
foregoing provision of this paragraph, the Executive shall forfeit any amounts
payable under this Agreement during that part of the Restricted Period occurring
after the period provided in the foregoing clause (A).</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Successors</U>. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the
prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive
otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive&#146;s legal
representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Company and its successors and assigns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Indemnification</U>. Executive shall be indemnified by the Company during his
employment, and after the Date of Termination during all periods within any
applicable statute of limitations or other period in which an action may be
brought against Executive for his acts or omissions during his employment with
the Company, to the same extent as the Company indemnifies other senior
executives of the Company.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Arbitration</U>. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance
with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then pertaining in
Chicago, Illinois and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator or
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator or arbitrators shall be deemed to possess the powers to issue
mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with such arbitration;
<U>provided</U>, however, that nothing in this Section 9 shall be construed so
as to deny the Company&#146;s right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in
a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach of Executive of any of his
covenants contained in Section 6 hereof. The Executive and the Company shall
each bear one-half of the costs and fees charged by the American Arbitration
Association (including, without limitation, the arbitrator&#146;s(s&#146;) fees). The
parties shall each be responsible for his or its own professional fees and
costs, subject to any award of professional fees and costs in the discretion of
the arbitrator or arbitrators.</FONT></P>
