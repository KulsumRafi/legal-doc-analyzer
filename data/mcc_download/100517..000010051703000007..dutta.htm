provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or benefit
received or to be received by Executive hereunder, when taken together
with any payment or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the
terms of any other plan, arrangement or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called "Total
Payments") </font>would be subject (in whole or part), to any excise tax
(the "Excise Tax") imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), then, the payments under Paragraph 3(A)
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) shall
thereafter be eliminated, to the extent necessary so that no portion of
the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but only if (A) the net
amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the
net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total
Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total
Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount
of Excise Tax to which Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced
Total Payments); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect
to have individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) eliminated prior to any
reduction of the cash payments under Paragraphs 3(A).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) For purposes of determining
whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the
Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment
of which Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as
not to constitute a "payment" within the meaning of section 280G(b) of
the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments
shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax
Counsel") reasonably acceptable to Executive and selected by the accounting
firm (the "Auditor") which was, immediately prior to the Effective Date,
United's independent auditor, does not constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason
of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax,
no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in
the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services
actually rendered, within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code,
in excess of the Base Amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash
benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments
shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of
sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F.&nbsp; <u>Air Transportation Safety and System
Stabilization Act</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, in the event that any payment or benefit received or to
be received by the Executive hereunder, when taken together with any payment
or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the terms of any other
plan, arrangement, or agreement with United, or any affiliate thereof which
is, in the opinion of counsel selected by United ("Counsel"), included
in "Total Compensation" as defined by Section 104(b) of the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Act") would, in the opinion of
Counsel, exceed the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act, then the
payments under Paragraph 3(A) included in Total Compensation shall first
be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) included in Total
Compensation shall thereafter be eliminated, <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>,
that Executive may elect to have individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C)
eliminated prior to any reduction of the cash payments under Paragraph
3(A).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Paragraph 3(F)(i) will not apply if (a)
United does not apply for Federal credit instrument under the Act by the
deadline stipulated in the Act or any amendment thereto or (b) if United
does apply for a Federal credit instrument under the Act by the deadline
but such Federal credit instrument is not actually issued to United for
any reason other than because the Executive's Total Compensation exceeds
the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4. <u>Termination of Employment Under Agreement</u>.

employment under this Agreement shall terminate and Executive will no longer
have the status of an active employee of United and will no longer be entitled
to any of the benefits of this Agreement (including the entitlement to
the payment and benefits described in Paragraph 3(C), other than those
required by law or otherwise vested), on the happening of the earliest
of the following events:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(i) Executive's death;
<p>(ii) Any material breach by Executive of Paragraph 6 or 9 hereof or
the failure by Executive to provide notice to United pursuant to Paragraph
4(B)(i) hereof;
<p>(iii) Executive's termination for Cause (as defined below).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall mean (a) the willful and continued failure
by Executive to substantially perform Executive's duties with United (other
than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical
or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive by the Supervisor, which demand specifically identifies
the manner in which the Supervisor believes that Executive has not substantially
performed Executive's duties, and Executive shall not have substantially
performed within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, (b) the
willful engaging by Executive in conduct, including any conduct that is
a violation of Executive's duties set forth under Paragraph 7 or 8 hereof,
which is demonstrably and materially injurious to United or its subsidiaries,
monetarily or otherwise or (c) Executive's conviction for the commission
of a felony. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of this definition, no
act, or failure to act, on Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless
done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in good faith and without
reasonable belief that Executive's act, or failure to act, was in the best
interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. <u>Election of Executive</u>. (i) During
the Term, if Executive elects to terminate his or her employment for any
reason, Executive will receive no further payments under Paragraphs 3(A)
above, and will no longer be entitled to any benefits under Paragraph 3(C)
(other than benefits required by law or otherwise vested). Before Executive's
election to terminate under this paragraph can become effective, Executive
must have provided United seven (7) days' written notice of his election
by registered mail addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal
World Headquarters offices. Executive's termination of employment will
be as of the seventh (7th) day after receipt by United of such notice,
at which time he or she will no longer have the status of an active employee
of United (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C), other than benefits required by law or otherwise vested).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii) During the Term, if Executive takes a Competitive Position (as
defined below) with a Competitor (as defined below) upon agreeing to such
employment, he:
<p>(a) must immediately so notify United in writing by registered mail
addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters
offices;
<p>(b) will be deemed to have elected to terminate his employment under
this Agreement (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C)) effective as of the day Executive becomes employed by such Competitor;
and
<p>(c) will be entitled to no further compensation after such effective
date.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes of this Agreement, (1) "Competitor" means any airline or air
carrier or any company affiliated, directly or indirectly, with another
airline or air carrier and (2) "Competitive Position" means becoming employed
by, a member of the board of directors of, a consultant to, or to otherwise
provide services of any nature to a Competitor directly or indirectly.
If during the Term, Executive desires to provide services whether as a
consultant, employee or otherwise to a Competitor and requests that United
consent to such provision of such services, United will reasonably consider
such request and will not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its
consent. In the event United consents to Executive's providing such services,
there will not be a termination of the Executive's employment under the
Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 4(B)(ii).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. <u>Survival</u>. Notwithstanding any termination
of Executive's employment under this Agreement, Executive shall continue
to be bound by (1) the provisions of Paragraphs 6 through 16 hereof, and
(2) the provisions of Paragraph 4(B)(ii)(a) hereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5. <u>Regulations</u>. During his or her employment, Executive will be
governed by applicable United regulations, as in effect from time to time,
to the extent that such regulations are consistent with Executive's status
as an on-call employee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6. <u>Confidentiality</u>.
<p>A. For purposes of this Agreement "Confidential Information" shall mean
and include, but not be limited to, the kinds of services provided or proposed
to be provided by United to customers, the manner in which such services
are performed or offered to be performed, information concerning United's
fleet plan, cost structure, strategic plan, labor strategy, information
concerning the creation, acquisition or disposition of products and services,
personnel information, and other trade secrets and confidential or proprietary
information concerning United's business, but shall not include information
which (I) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Executive, (II) was available to Executive
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by UAL or UA, or (III)
becomes available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a person
other than UAL, UA or their officers, directors, employees or agents who
is not otherwise bound by any confidentiality obligations with respect
to the information provided to Executive (the "Confidential Information").
<p>B. (i) Executive acknowledges that: (a) United's business is intensely
competitive and that Executive's employment by United has required and
during the Term may continue to require that Executive have access to and
knowledge of Confidential Information of United, (b) the direct or indirect
disclosure of any Confidential Information would place United at a disadvantage
and would do damage, monetary or otherwise, to United's business, and (c)
the engaging by Executive in any of the activities prohibited by this Paragraph
6 may constitute improper appropriation or use of such Confidential Information.
Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Confidential
Information and that the Confidential Information constitutes a protectible
business interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Whether directly or indirectly, individually,
as a director, stockholder, owner, partner, employee, principal, or agent
of any business, or in any other capacity, during the Term of this Agreement
and for the two (2) year period thereafter, Executive shall not make known,
disclose, furnish, make available or utilize any of the Confidential Information,
other than in the proper performance of the duties contemplated under this
Agreement. Executive shall return any tangible Confidential Information,
including photocopies, extracts and summaries thereof, or any such information
stored electronically on tapes, computer disks, or in any other manner
that Executive has in his possession (a) on the Effective Date of this
Agreement, (b) at the end of the Term, and (c) at such time as United requests
Executive to do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Executive acknowledges and agrees that
due to the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information
he or she possesses, a breach or threatened breach by him or her of any
of the provisions contained in this Paragraph 6 will cause United irreparable
injury. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies, Executive
agrees that United shall be entitled to a temporary, preliminary, and permanent
injunction enjoining or restraining Executive from any such violation or
threatened violation, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
monetary damages or the posting of any bond or security. Executive consents
to jurisdiction for such enforcement in any state or federal court in the
State of Illinois.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Executive further acknowledges and agrees
that due to the uniqueness of his services and confidential nature of the
Confidential Information he or she possesses, the covenants set forth herein
are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill
of United.
<br>Executive understands that it is United's intent to have this promise
of confidentiality enforced to its fullest extent. Accordingly, Executive
and United agree that, if any portion of this promise of confidentiality
is unenforceable, the court should still construe and enforce this promise
of confidentiality to the fullest extent permitted by law.
<p>C. Executive agrees to keep the terms of and circumstances surrounding
this Agreement and of his or her working arrangement, as defined herein,
confidential except that the source and amount of his or her income may
be revealed as necessary for tax, loan purposes and the like.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.&nbsp; <u>Non-Disparagement</u>

respective present or former officers, directors, partners, shareholders,

<dir>
<dir>"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT
WITH THE DEBTOR."</dir>

Executive acknowledges that Executive may hereafter discover claims or
facts in addition to or different from those which Executive now knows
or believes to exist with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and which, if known or suspected at the time of executing this Agreement,

or applications of this Agreement which can be given effect without the
invalid provisions or application in accordance with the essential intent
and purpose of this Agreement, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement

payable to Executive by United pursuant to this Agreement. Furthermore,

not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of
employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against
any amount claimed to be owed by Executive to United, or otherwise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

forth above, agrees that judgment may be entered in the courts of the State
of Illinois on any such arbitration award, consents to the jurisdiction
of the courts of Illinois, both state and federal, for the enforcement
of any such arbitration award and agrees not to disturb such choice of
forum. Notwithstanding the above, Executive further agrees that United
may seek temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief to enforce
the provisions contained in Paragraph 6, without first proceeding to arbitration.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
