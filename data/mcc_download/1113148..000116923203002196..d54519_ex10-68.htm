DPI does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third person, with respect to any of the Shares.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>(c)</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size=2>DPI is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Shares.

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>(e)</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size=2>DPI understands that the Shares it is purchasing are characterized as &#147;restricted securities&#148; under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from Fine in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Act&#148;) only in certain limited circumstances. In the absence of an effective registration statement covering the Shares or an available exemption from registration under the Act, the Shares must be held indefinitely. In this connection, DPI represents that it is familiar with SEC Rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Act, including without limitation the Rule 144 condition that current
information about the Company be available to the public. Such information is not now available and the Company has no present plans to make such information available.</font></p>

DPI will not sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares unless and until (i) such shares are subsequently registered under the Act and each applicable state securities law; or (ii) (1) an exemption from such registration is available thereunder, and (2) DPI has notified the Company of the proposed transfer and has furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such transfer will not require registration of such shares under the Act. DPI understands that the Company is not obligated, and does not intend, to register any Shares under the Act or any state securities laws.</font></p>
