                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
                               AND REORGANIZATION

                  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of September 17, 2002, by and among
QUIKSILVER, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), QS RETAIL, INC., a
California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
BEACH STREET, INC., a Utah corporation (the "Company"), and JOHN THOMPSON and
DIANA THOMPSON (individually, a "Shareholder" and collectively, the
"Shareholders"). Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes collectively referred
to herein as the "Constituent Corporations."

                  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that it is in the best interest of their respective
companies and in the best interest of their respective stockholders to
consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which the
Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with
and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"); and

                  WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, among other things, all of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company ("Company Common Stock")
shall be converted into shares of Common Stock of the Parent ("Parent Common
Stock").

                  WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and that this Agreement shall be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

                  WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1      The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of California (the "CGCL") and the Utah Revised
Business Corporation Act of the State of Utah ("URBCA"), at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.3 hereof), the Company shall merge with and into Merger
Sub. Merger Sub shall be the surviving company (hereinafter sometimes called the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Merger and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of California. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
<PAGE>
         1.2      Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction
or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article V hereof or at such
other time as the parties hereto agree (the "Closing Date"), provided, however,
that the parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to effect the Closing
on or prior to September 17, 2002. The Closing shall take place at the offices
of Hewitt & O'Neil LLP, 19900 MacArthur Blvd., Suite 1050, Irvine, California or
at such other location as the parties hereto agree.

         1.3      Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the Shareholders shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing (i) a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the
"California Secretary of State") in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the CGCL and (ii) Articles of Merger
(the "Articles of Merger") with the State of Utah Division of Corporations and
Commercial Code (the "Division") in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the URBCA. The term "Effective Time"
shall be the later of the filing of such Certificate of Merger with the
California Secretary of State and the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Division, or at such later time as agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub, and
the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of
Merger.

         1.4      Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger, the Articles of Merger, and the applicable provisions of the CGCL and
the URBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.5      Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect at the Effective Time,
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. At the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.

         1.6      Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

         1.7      Merger Consideration; Conversion and Cancellation of Company
Common Stock. By virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Shareholders:

                  (a)   Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
all rights in respect thereof

                                       2
<PAGE>
shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 29.8092 shares of Parent Common
Stock (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) cash from Parent as set forth in
Section 1.7(b) below (the "Cash Consideration"). The Stock Consideration and
Cash Consideration are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Merger
Consideration. Total stock consideration shall equal 298,092 shares of Parent
Company common stock.

                  (b)   Cash Consideration Calculation. The total Cash
Consideration paid to the Shareholders shall equal the sum of (i) the Company's
cash balance, as determined consistent with the Company's past practices, as of
the Effective Time, and (ii) increased or decreased by the difference (+ of -)
between the Company's accounts payable and inventory as of the Effective Time,
all as determined and valued consistent with the Company's past practices. For
example, (i) as of the Effective Time if the Company's cash balance was
$100,000, accounts payable balance was $80,000, and the inventory balance was
$70,000, the total Cash Consideration would equal $90,000 or (i) as of the
Effective Time if the Company's cash balance was $100,000, accounts payable
balance was $70,000, and the inventory balance was $80,000, the Total Cash
Consideration would equal $110,000. The Cash Consideration shall be paid on or
before September 24, 2002. The Cash Consideration shall be divided between the
two Shareholders in accordance with their respective ownership percentages of
the Company.

                  (c)   Right to Accounting. Subsequent to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall allow the Shareholders, and their
agents, full access to the books and records of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to verify the calculation and determination of the Cash
Consideration.

                  (d)   Cancellation of Company Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Certificates previously representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock upon surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 1.9 hereof, without any
interest.

         1.8      No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (a) No certificates or scrip of shares of Parent Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock.

                  (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for a share
of Parent

                                       3
<PAGE>
Common Stock on the date of the Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after
the determination of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof.

         1.9      Exchange of Shares.

                  (a)   Delivery of Merger Consideration. Immediately following
the Merger, upon surrender by the Shareholders of the certificates representing
the Company Common Stock, Parent shall cause to be issued to each Shareholder
certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(a) above.

                  (b)   Transfer Restrictions; Legends. The shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall not be transferable in the absence of an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), or an exemption therefrom. In the absence of an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, neither such shares
of Parent Common Stock nor any interest therein shall be sold, transferred,
assigned or otherwise disposed of, unless Parent shall have previously received
an opinion of counsel knowledgeable in Federal securities law, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that registration
under the Securities Act is not required in connection with such disposition.
Parent shall be entitled to give stop transfer instructions to its transfer
agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock in order to enforce the
foregoing restrictions.

                  The certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall bear the following legend
restricting the transfer thereof, in addition to any other legend required by
applicable law:

         "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
         UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
         TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS (1) A REGISTRATION
         STATEMENT WITH RESPECT THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT, (2) SUCH
         TRANSFER IS PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR (3) THE HOLDER
         HEREOF FURNISHES TO THE ISSUER AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH COUNSEL AND
         WHICH OPINION SHALL BE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT
         REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS NOT REQUIRED."

         1.10     Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Utah. The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such qualification necessary. The copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company which have previously been delivered to
Parent are true and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

                  (b)   The Company owns no equity interests in any corporation,
partnership or other entity.

         2.2      Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 50,000 shares of Company Common Stock, no par value per share. As of
the date hereof, there are (i) 10,000 shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding, all of which are held by the Shareholders, and (ii) no shares of
Preferred Stock outstanding. All \of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are free of any liens or encumbrances created by or
resulting from the actions of the Company, and are not subject to preemptive
rights or rights of first refusal created by statute, the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any agreement to which the Company or
any Shareholder is a party or by which it is bound. All outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock were issued in compliance with all applicable federal and
state securities laws. The Company does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, convertible securities, calls,
commitments, agreements or obligations of any character calling for the
purchase, redemption or issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
other equity security of the Company or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Company Common Stock or any other
equity security of the Company.

         2.3      Authority; No Violation.

execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors and shareholders of the
Company. No other corporate proceedings on the part of the

                                       5
<PAGE>
Company are necessary to approve this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and all other agreements and
documents to be entered into in connection herewith have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and each of the Shareholders and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) constitute
valid and binding obligations of the Company and each of the Shareholders,
enforceable against the Company and each of the Shareholders, in accordance with
their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general
principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and
by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally.

                  (b)   Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and each of the Shareholders, nor the consummation by the Company
and each of the Shareholders of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company and each of the Shareholders with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or (ii) assuming that the consents and
approvals referred to in Section 2.4 hereof are duly obtained, (x) violate any
statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to the Company or any of the Shareholders or any of their
respective properties or assets, or (y) materially violate, materially conflict

terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, material license, material sublicense, material lease, material agreement
or other material instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of the
Shareholders is a party, or by which the Company or any of the Shareholders or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected.

         2.4      Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the California Secretary of State and the Articles of
Merger with the Division pursuant to the CGCL and Section 1107 of the URBCA, (b)

material obligations or liabilities of any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed

guarantor or indemnitor of any other person, firm, partnership or corporation
("Person")) other than (i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the

<PAGE>

material adverse effect on the Company.

Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal actions, suits, arbitrations or
other legal, administrative or governmental proceedings or investigations
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or either of the Shareholders,
threatened against the Company or any of its properties, assets or business and
to the knowledge of the Company and the Shareholders there exist no facts which
could reasonably be expected to result in any such action, suit or other
proceeding or which would challenge the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company is not in default with
respect to any judgment, order or decree of any court or any governmental agency
or instrumentality. The foregoing includes, without limiting the generality
thereof, pending or threatened actions involving the Company's use in connection
with the Company's business of any information or techniques allegedly
proprietary to a former employee.

         2.9      Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company which has or

impairing any current business practice of the Company, any acquisition of
property by the Company, the ability of the Company to compete with any other
person or the conduct of business by the Company as currently conducted by the
Company.

         2.10     Governmental Authorization. Except as would not have a
materially adverse effect on the operations or financial conditions of the
Company, the Company has obtained each federal, state, county, local or foreign
governmental consent, license, permit, grant, or other authorization of a
Governmental Entity (i) pursuant to which the Company currently operates or
holds any interest in any of its properties or (ii) that is required for the
operation of the Company's business or the holding of any such interest ((i) and
(ii) herein collectively called the "Company Authorizations"), and all of such
Company Authorizations are in full force and effect.

         2.11     Title and Condition of Personal Property. The Company has good
and marketable title to all personal property owned by it that is material to
its business and reflected in the Reference Balance Sheet or acquired after the
Reference Balance Sheet Date (other than property sold or otherwise disposed of
since the Reference Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business), free
and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any kind
or character or claims thereto, except (i) the lien of current taxes not yet due
and payable, (ii) such imperfections of title, liens and easements as do not and
will not materially detract from or interfere with the use of the properties
subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair business
operations involving such properties, (iii) liens securing debt which is
reflected on the Reference Balance Sheet, and (iv) as set forth in Section 2.11
of the Company Disclosure

                                       8
<PAGE>
Schedule. The material property and equipment of the Company that is used in the
operations of its business are in all material respects in good operating
condition and repair. All material properties used in the operations of the
Company are reflected in the Reference Balance Sheet.

         2.12     Real and Leased Property.

                  (a)   The Company does not own any fee simple interest in real
property. The Company does not lease or sublease any real property other than as
set forth on Section 2.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Section 2.12 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the street address of each parcel of
real property leased or subleased by the Company (the "Leased Property"). The
Company has previously delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of all of
the lease and sublease agreements, as amended to date (the "Leases") relating to
the Leased Property. The Company enjoys a peaceful and undisturbed possession of
the Leased Property held by it. All improvements located on the Leased Property
are in a state of good maintenance and repair and in a condition adequate and
suitable for the effective conduct therein of the business conducted and
proposed to be conducted by the Company. No person other than the Company has
any right to use or occupy any part of the Leased Property, whether pursuant to
sublease, license or otherwise. The Leases are valid, binding and in full force
and effect, all rent and other sums and charges payable thereunder are current,
no notice of default or termination under any of the Leases is outstanding, no
termination event or condition or uncured default on the part of the Company or,
to the knowledge of the Company or either of the Shareholders, on the part of
the landlord or sublandlord, as the case may be, thereunder, exists under the
Leases, and to the knowledge of the Company or either of the Shareholders, no
event has occurred and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or termination event
or condition. In the event that any of the Leases is a sublease, the Company, as
sublessee or sublessor, as the case may be, has obtained the required consent of
the prime landlord to such sublease, and such prime lease is in full force and
effect, there are no outstanding uncured notices of default or termination, and
no right of the Company in any such sublease conflicts with such prime lease.
All of the Leased Property is used in the conduct of the Company's business.

                  (b)   The heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing,
electrical systems and telephone systems at the Leased Property are in a
condition reasonably adequate and suitable for the effective conduct therein of
the business conducted by the Company and will be so adequate and suitable on
the Closing Date. The Company has not experienced any material interruption in
the services provided to any of the Leased Property within the last twelve (12)
months. To the knowledge of the Company or either of the Shareholders, but
without any inquiry of the applicable landlord, no landlord under the Leases has
any plans to make any material alterations to any of the Leased Property, the
construction of which would interfere with the use of any portion of the Leased
Property. To the knowledge of the Company or either of the Shareholders, but
without any inquiry of the applicable landlord, no landlord under the Leases has
any plans to make any material alterations to any of the buildings in which
Leased Property is located, the costs of which alterations would be borne in any
part by a tenant under the applicable Lease.

                  (c)   The Company has all material permits, licenses,
franchises, approvals and authorizations (collectively, the "Real Property
Permits") of all Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over each Leased
Property and from all insurance companies and fire rating and

                                       9
<PAGE>
other similar boards and organizations (collectively, the "Insurance
Organizations") necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted. To the
knowledge of the Company and the Shareholders, all such Real Property Permits
required or appropriate have been lawfully issued to the Company to enable each
Leased Property to be lawfully occupied and used for all of the purposes for
which they are currently occupied and useful and are, as of the date hereof, in
full force and effect. The Company has not received or been informed by a third
party of the receipt by it of any notice from any Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over any Leased Property or from any Insurance Organization
threatening a suspension, revocation, modification or cancellation of any Real
Property Permit or of any insurance policies and, to the knowledge of the
Company or either of the Shareholders, there is currently no basis for the
issuance of any such notice or the taking of any such action.

                  (d)   To the knowledge of the Company or either of the
Shareholders, there are no liabilities (other than rent and other sums and
charges regularly payable) associated with any of the Leases including, without
limitation, any liability under any Environmental and Safety Law, which is or
which may become payable by the Surviving Corporation.

         2.13     Intellectual Property.

                  (a)   Section 2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth an accurate and complete description of (i) all trademarks, service marks,
trade names, brands and copyrights of the Company; and (ii) substantially all
franchises, licenses, sublicenses, contracts, options and agreements, other than
shrink-wrap software licenses, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to
use any intellectual property not owned by the Company. The Company does not own
or use any patents.

                  (b)   Except as set forth in Section 2.13(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns or has the right to use all intellectual
property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted by it,
including, without limitation, all network operating system and database
softwares or other intellectual property used by the Company.

                  (c) Except for third party licenses listed in Section 2.13(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is the sole and exclusive owner
of its Intellectual Property including, but not limited to, those listed or
described on the Company Disclosure Schedule, or has the right to the use
thereof for the material covered thereby in connection with the services or
products in respect to which they have been or are now being used.

                  (d)   To the knowledge of the Company or either of the
Shareholders, except as set forth in Section 2.13(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there has been no unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement or
misappropriation of any material intellectual property rights of the Company,
any trade secret material to the Company, or any material intellectual property
right of any third party to the extent licensed by or through the Company, by
any third party, including any employee of the Company.

         2.14     Taxes.

                  (a)   The Company has duly and timely filed (including
applicable extensions granted without penalty) all material Tax Returns (as
hereinafter defined) required to be filed at

                                       10

material respects, and the Company has paid in full or made adequate provision
in the Financial Statements for all material Taxes (as hereinafter defined)
shown to be due on such Tax Returns. As of the date hereof (i) the Company has
not requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns in
respect of any fiscal year which have not since been filed and no request for
waivers of the time to assess any Taxes are pending or outstanding, (ii) no
claim for Taxes has become a lien against the property of the Company or is
being asserted against the Company other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, (iii) no audit of any Tax Return of the Company is being conducted by a
Tax authority, (iv) no extension of the statute of limitations on the assessment
of any Taxes has been granted to the Company and is currently in effect, and (v)
there is no agreement, contract or arrangement to which the Company is a party
that may result in the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by
reason of Sections 280G, 162 or 404 of the Code. The Company has not been or
will be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period
(or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a result of
transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the Merger.

                  (b) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean all
taxes, charges, fees, levies, penalties or other assessments imposed by any
United States federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority, including, but
not limited to income, excise, property, sales, transfer, franchise, payroll,
withholding, social security or other taxes, including any interest, penalties
or additions attributable thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Return"

                  (a)   The following terms shall be defined as follows:

                        (i)       "Environmental and Safety Laws" shall mean any

Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all supplies and services
necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company as presently conducted,
may be obtained from alternate sources on terms and conditions comparable to
those presently available to the Company, and no facts, circumstances or
conditions exist which create a reasonable basis for believing that the Company
will be unable to continue to procure the supplies and services necessary to
conduct its business on substantially the same terms and conditions as such
supplies and services are currently procured.

         2.17     List of Accounts. Set forth in Section 2.17 of the Company

Disclosure Schedule, there are no employment, consulting, severance or
indemnification arrangements, agreements or understandings between the Company
and any officer, director, consultant or employee including, without limitation,
any contracts to employ executive officers, any severance, change in control or

will result in any obligation (absolute or contingent) of the Company to make
any payment to any officer, employee or agent of the Company following either
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, termination of
employment, or both ("Company Employment Agreements").

         2.19     Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a)   Section 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists, with respect to the Company (i) all material employee benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")) maintained, sponsored or

                                       12
<PAGE>
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company, (ii) each loan
to a non-officer employee, loans to officers and directors and any stock option,
stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental
retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability,
employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Code section 125) or dependent care
(Code Section 129), life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or
arrangements, (iii) all bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, deferred
compensation or incentive plans, programs or arrangements, (iv) other fringe or
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements that apply to senior management
of the Company and that do not generally apply to all employees, and (v) any
current or former employment or executive compensation or severance agreements,
written or otherwise, as to which unsatisfied obligations of the Company of
greater than $10,000 remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or
former employee, consultant or director of the Company (together, the "Company
Employee Plans"). There is no trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
which is treated as a single employer with the Company within the meaning of
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

                  (b)   The Company has furnished to Parent a copy of the
Company Employee Plans and related plan documents, to the extent reduced to
writing (including trust documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee
booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and, to the
extent still in its possession, any material employee communications relating
thereto) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject to
ERISA reporting requirements, provided copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for
the last three plan years. The Company has, with respect to any Company Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, either obtained
from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its
qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or applied to the
Internal Revenue Service for such a determination letter prior to the expiration
of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination. The
Company has also furnished Parent with the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and
nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any
Company Employee Plan subject to Code Section 401(a).

                  (c)   Except as disclosed in Section 2.19(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the Company's and either of the Shareholder's knowledge,
(i) none of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or

Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement or making any other
public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an

hereby, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such

Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek, and use its best efforts to
obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for the

<PAGE>
                  (a)   The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and none of the material terms and conditions
thereof have been or will be waived or modified.

                  (b)   The consideration to be received in the Merger by the
Shareholders of the Company was the result of arm's length bargaining between
the managements of Parent and the Company. The fair market value of the Merger
Consideration and any cash received in lieu of fractional shares to be received
by each Shareholder of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair
market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.

                  (c)   In the Merger, the holders of Company Common Stock will
receive, in exchange for their Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration.
Except for the consideration described herein, no cash or other property
originating with Parent or its affiliates has been or will be paid to the
holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for Company Common Stock. As of the
Effective Time, the Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger will have a value
that is not less than 50% of the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration as
of such time.

                  (d)   The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares, if any, and
does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock
instead of issuing fractions of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent
(1%) of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to holders of
Company Common Stock in exchange for their Company Common Stock.

                  (e)   Prior to and in connection with the Merger, no shares of
Company Common Stock have been or will be (i) redeemed by the Company, (ii)
acquired by a person related to the Company (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3) determined without regard to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) for consideration other than Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, or (iii) the subject of any extraordinary
distribution by the Company.

                  (f)   There is no plan or intention on the part of either of
the Shareholders to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any Parent Common
Stock to be received in the Merger by such holder directly or indirectly to
Parent or to a person related to Parent (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) for consideration other than Parent Common
Stock.

                  (g)   No shareholders of the Company will elect appraisal or
dissenters' rights.

                  (h)   The Company has no outstanding equity interests other
than as described in Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time,
and following the Merger, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants,
options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which
any person could acquire stock in the Company.

                  (i)   The Company has no plan or intention to issue additional
shares of its stock.

                                       25
<PAGE>

directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or
contingent, of any holder of Company Common Stock.

                  (k)   The Company is not an investment company as defined in
Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

                  (l)   The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in
a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
Code.

                  (m)   There is no inter-corporate indebtedness existing
between Parent and the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company that was
issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount.

                  (n)   None of the compensation to be received by any
shareholder-employee of the Company in the Merger will be separate consideration
for, or allocable to, any of such person's shares of Company Common Stock; none
of the Parent Common Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of the
Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any past or future
services, and the compensation to be paid to any shareholder-employee after the
Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services.

                  (o)   In connection with the Merger, the Company has not sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of any of its assets as would prevent Parent
from either continuing the historic business of the Company or using a
significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business
following the Merger, both within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d).

                  (p)   On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the
assets of the Company will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of
liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

                  (q)   In the Merger, Merger Sub will acquire at least 90% of
the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70% of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger.
For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by the Company to shareholders
who receive cash or other property in the Merger, amounts used by the Company to
pay its reorganization expenses and those of its shareholders, and all
redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by the
Company will be included as assets of the Company immediately prior to the
Merger.

                  (r)   All options, warrants or rights to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock were issued with an exercise price no less than fair market
value at the time of issue.

                  (s)   The Merger is being affected for bona fide business
reasons.

                  (t)   None of the Company's preferred stock is issued or
outstanding.

                                       26
<PAGE>
                  (u)   The liabilities of the Company assumed by Merger Sub and
the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Company are subject were
incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of business.

                  (v)   The Company will not take any position on any federal,
state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any tax reporting
position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization for federal income tax purposes, unless otherwise required by a
"determination" (as defined by Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by a change in
law after the date hereof.

                  (w)   The Merger Agreement (including all exhibits and
attachments thereto) represents the full and complete agreement between Parent,
Merger Sub, Company, and the Shareholders regarding the Merger, and there are no
other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger.

         4.8      Certifications, Agreements, and Covenants of Parent and Merger
Sub. Parent and Merger Sub certify, agree, and covenant to the Company as
follows:

market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.

                  (c)   In the Merger, the holders of Company Common Stock will
receive, in exchange for their Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration.

originating with Parent or its affiliates has been or will be paid to the
holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for Company Common Stock. As of the

Company will be included as assets of the Company immediately prior to the

<PAGE>

of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto

insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition

other failure.

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their

2.       REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         2.1      PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION. If the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement for shares of Common Stock to be issued by the Company
other than a Registration Statement (i) on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor
Form thereto or (ii) filed in connection

                                       A-2
<PAGE>
with an exchange offer (a "PIGGY BACK REGISTRATION STATEMENT") at any time until
the date that such shares cease to be Registrable Shares then, the Company will,
within 10 business days prior to such filing, give written notice to all Rights
Holders of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of Rights
Holders holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the Registrable Shares
given within twenty (20) days after the Company provides such notice, the
Company shall use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Shares which the
Company has been requested by such Rights Holders to register to be registered
under such Piggy Back Registration Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall have the right to postpone or withdraw any registration effected
pursuant to this Section 2.1 without incurring any liability for doing so to any
Rights Holder. Subject to Section 2.4 below, if any Registrable Shares are to be
registered pursuant to this Section 2.1, then the Company shall provide notice
of such fact to all Rights Holders, and all Rights Holders will then have the
right to register their Registrable Shares under such Piggy Back Registration
Statement. In the event the Company and its underwriters, if any, permit all
eligible Registrable Shares to be registered under Piggy Back Registration
Statement without any Cutback (as hereinafter defined), and such Registration
Statement (i) is declared effective by the Commission and (ii) remains effective
for the Applicable Registration Period (as hereinafter defined), then, the Piggy
Back Registration Rights under this Section 2.1 and the Demand Registration
Rights under Section 2.2 shall terminate at the end of such time period.

         2.2      DEMAND REGISTRATION. Subject to Section 2.1, at any time on or
after February 1, 2003, Rights Holders holding in the aggregate at least a
majority of the Registrable Shares may request, in writing, that the Company
effect the registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the
Registrable Shares. If the holders initiating the registration intend to
distribute the Registrable Shares by means of an underwriting, they shall so
advise the Company in their request. Upon receipt of any such request, the
Company shall promptly give written notice of such proposed registration to all
Rights Holders. All Rights Holders shall have the right, by giving written
notice to the Company within twenty (20) days after the Company provides its
notice, to elect to participate in such registration. In the event such
registration is underwritten, the right of other Rights Holders to participate
shall be conditioned on such Rights Holders' participation in such underwriting.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, all Rights Holders who have elected to
participate in the registration may participate in the registration up to the
number of Registrable Shares which they hold. Thereupon, the Company shall, as
expeditiously as practicable, use its best efforts to effect the registration of
the amount of Registrable Shares so requested to be registered. If a required
registration pursuant to this Section 2.2 is an underwritten offering, the
Company may select a managing underwriter to administer the offering as long as
such underwriter is of recognized standing.

         2.3      NUMBER OF DEMANDS. Except as hereinafter set forth in Section
2.5 or Section 3.3, the Company shall not be required to effect more than one
(1) registration pursuant to Section 2.2 above; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2.2 shall count as a
registration statement that satisfies the Company's registration obligations
under Section 2.2, and such obligations shall continue in full force and effect,
if (i) the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission
within 90 days after the date it was originally filed with the Commission, or
(ii) the Company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement until the Registrable Shares could be sold pursuant to

                                       A-3
<PAGE>
Rules 144 or 145 under the Securities Act or any similar provision then in force
(subject to the provisions herein regarding Suspension Events).

         2.4      UNDERWRITER CUTBACK. In connection with any registration under
Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 above involving an underwriting, the Company shall
not be required to include any Registrable Shares in such registration unless
the holders thereof accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between
the Company and the underwriters selected by it (provided that such terms must
be consistent with this Agreement and the terms customarily included in
agreements of this nature for underwritten public offerings). If in the opinion
of the managing underwriter it is appropriate because of marketing factors to
limit the number of Registrable Shares to be included in the offering, then the
Company shall be required to include in the registration only that number of
Registrable Shares, if any, which the managing underwriter believes should be
included therein. If the number of Registrable Shares to be included in the
offering in accordance with the foregoing is less than the total number of
shares which the holders of Registrable Shares have requested to be included
("CUTBACK"), then the holders of Registrable Shares who have requested
registration and other holders of securities entitled to include securities in
such registration shall participate in the registration pro rata based upon
their total ownership of Common Stock. If any holder would thus be entitled to
include more securities than such holder requested to be registered, the excess
shall be allocated among other requesting holders pro rata in the manner
described in the preceding sentence.

         2.5      DELAY OF DEMAND. If at the time of the receipt of a request to
register Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 above, the Company is
engaged or plans to file a Registration Statement with the Commission within
forty-five (45) days after the time of the request in a registered public
offering or is engaged in any other activity which, in the good faith
determination of the Company's Board of Directors, would be adversely affected
by the requested registration to the material detriment of the Company, then the
Company may at its option, within five (5) business days after the receipt of
the Registration Request, direct that such request be delayed for a period not
in excess of sixty (60) days of the initial request. In the event of any such
delay, the time periods within which the Rights Holders are entitled to exercise
their registration rights under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 shall be extended for a
period of time equal to the duration of such delay.

3.       REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

         3.1      COMPANY ACTIONS UPON EXERCISE OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. If and
whenever the Company is required by the provisions of this Agreement to use its
best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of any of the
Registrable Shares, subject to Section 2.5, the Company shall:

                  (a)   as expeditiously as reasonably practicable prepare and
file with the Commission a Registration Statement with respect to such
Registrable Shares and use its best efforts to cause that Registration Statement
to become effective as soon as possible thereafter;

                  (b)   as expeditiously as reasonably practicable prepare and
file with the Commission any amendments and supplements to the Registration
Statement and the prospectus included in the Registration Statement as may be
necessary to keep the Registration Statement

                                       A-4
<PAGE>
effective, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten public offering, until
each underwriter has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by
it and, in the case of any other offering, until the earlier of the sale of all
Registrable Shares covered thereby or September 30, 2003 (each, an "APPLICABLE
REGISTRATION PERIOD");

                  (c)   as expeditiously as reasonably practicable furnish to
each selling Rights Holder such reasonable numbers of copies of the prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents, as the selling Rights Holder may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition
of the Registrable Shares owned by the selling Rights Holder; and

                  (d)   as expeditiously as reasonably practicable use its best
efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such states as
the selling Rights Holders shall reasonably request, and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or desirable to enable the selling Rights
Holders to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such states of the
Registrable Shares owned by the selling Rights Holder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Company shall not be required in connection with this Section 3.1(d) to
qualify as a foreign corporation or execute a general consent to service of
process in any jurisdiction.

         3.2      SUSPENSION EVENTS. Following the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement (and the making of any required filings with any state
securities commissions), the Company may direct the selling Rights Holders to
suspend sales of the Registrable Securities, as provided herein, if one or more
of the following events (each, a "SUSPENSION EVENT") occurs:

                  (a)   an underwritten primary offering by the Company where
the Company is advised by the underwriters for such offering that sale of
Registrable Shares under the Registration Statement would have a material
adverse effect on the primary offering (a "PUBLIC OFFERING SUSPENSION EVENT");

                  (b)   (i)       pending negotiations relating to, or
consummation of, a transaction or the occurrence of an event:

                                    (A) that would require additional disclosure
                  of material information by the Company in the Registration
                  Statement (or such filings) not otherwise proposed to be
                  disclosed; or

                                    (B) that renders the Company unable to
                  comply with Commission requirements; or

                        (ii)      a good faith determination by the Company that
the offering of Registrable Securities would:

                                    (A) materially impede, delay or interfere
                  with any proposed financing, offer or sale of securities,
                  acquisition, corporate reorganization or other significant
                  transaction involving the Company; or

                                       A-5
<PAGE>
                                    (B) conflict with material business plans of
                  the Company in a manner not in the best interests of the
                  Company (each, a "MATERIAL EVENT SUSPENSION"); or

                        (iii)       if at any time the Company would be required
to obtain audited financial statements not being prepared independently of the
Registration Statement, unless the Rights Holders undertake to pay the Company's
expenses in obtaining the requisite financial statements and an audit is
feasible and can be accomplished with minimal disruption to the Company and its
business ("REQUIRED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE SUSPENSION").

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that

         (x)      in the case of any Public Offering Suspension Event, the
period of suspension shall terminate (A) within forty-five (45) days if the
Registration Statement therefor is not filed with the Commission prior thereto,
(B) if the Registration Statement is filed with the Commission within such 45
day period, but is not declared effective within the succeeding 90 days, on the
earlier of the termination of such 90-day period or the withdrawal of such
Registration Statement by the Company;

         (y)      in the case of a Material Event Suspension under subsection
(ii), the duration of the suspension shall terminate on the earlier of the
public announcement of such Suspension Event and the expiration of forty-five
(45) days from the commencement of the suspension and, in the case of a Material
Event Suspension under subsection (i), the Company shall use its best efforts to
cause the duration of the suspension to terminate as soon as reasonably
practicable; and

         (z)      in the case of Required Financial Disclosure Suspension, the
period of suspension shall terminate when the requisite financial statements are
available.

In case of any Public Offering Suspension Event, Material Event Suspension or
Required Financial Disclosure Suspension, the duration of the Applicable
Registration Period of the suspended Registration Statement shall be extended
for a period of time equal to the duration of the suspension.

         3.3      AGREEMENT OF RIGHTS HOLDERS. In the case of a Suspension
Event, the Company shall give written notice (a "SUSPENSION NOTICE") to the
selling Rights Holders to suspend sales of the Registrable Shares so that the
Company may correct or update the Registration Statement (or such filings);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such suspension shall continue no longer than the
applicable period of time set forth in Section 3.2 above. The selling Rights
Holders agree that they will not effect any sales of the Registrable Shares
pursuant to such Registration Statement (or such filings) at any time during the
period from the date they received a Suspension Notice from the Company to such
date as of which the Suspension Period shall expire as provided in clauses (x),
(y) and (z) of Section 3.2 above. If so directed by the Company, selling Rights
Holders will deliver to the Company all copies of the prospectus covering the
Registrable Shares held by them at the time of receipt of the Suspension Notice.
The selling Rights Holders may recommence sales of the Registrable Shares
pursuant to the Registration Statement (or such filings) following further
written notice to such effect (an "END OF SUSPENSION NOTICE") from the Company,
which End of Suspension Notice shall be

                                       A-6
<PAGE>
accompanied by copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to
resume such sales.

         3.4      INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

         3.5      CESSATION OF OFFERS. Upon receipt of any notice (including any
Suspension Notice) from the Company of:

                  (a)   any Suspension Event;

                  (b)   any request by the Commission for amendments or
supplements to a Registration Statement or for additional information;

                  (c)   any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act;

                  (d)   the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose;

                  (e)   the representations and warranties of the Company made
in any underwriting agreement relating to the registration ceasing to be true
and correct in any material respect;

                  (f)   the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities
registered in such registration for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation
or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose (in which case the cessation
of sales shall pertain only to the applicable jurisdiction);

                  (g)   the happening of any event which makes any statement
made in a Registration Statement or any document incorporated therein by
reference untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any
changes in any such Registration Statement so that they will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
or

                  (h)   the Company's reasonable determination that a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate;

the selling Rights Holders shall immediately cease making offers of Registrable
Shares (and shall return all prospectuses) until the Company provides such
selling Rights Holders any required supplemental or amended materials or of
advice in writing that use of the applicable Registration Statement may be
resumed. In such event, the Company will use its reasonable efforts promptly to
correct or supplement the Registration Statement, to obtain the lifting of any
stop order or otherwise to remove the circumstances preventing the continuance
of offers and sales under the Registration Statement, subject to the Company's
right to delay such actions with respect to any Suspension Event. The Company
shall promptly after such correction or supplement provide the selling Rights
Holders with revised prospectuses and, following receipt of the revised
prospectuses, the selling Rights Holders shall be free to resume making offers
of the Registrable Shares. In such event, however, at the time the Rights
Holders are permitted to

                                       A-7
<PAGE>
resume making such offers the Applicable Registration Period shall be extended
for a number of days equal to the period during which the Rights Holders were
required to cease selling their Registrable Shares pursuant to this Section 3.4.

4.       ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES

         The Company will pay all Registration Expenses of any registration
under this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.2, if a registration is withdrawn at the request of the Rights Holders
requesting such registration (other than as a result of information concerning
material adverse developments in the business or financial condition of the
Company which is made known to the Rights Holders after the date on which such
registration was requested) and if the requesting Rights Holders elect not to
have such registration counted as a registration requested under Section 2, the
requesting Rights Holders shall pay the Registration Expenses of such
registration pro rata in accordance with the number of their Registrable Shares
included in such registration (provided such registration was requested pursuant
to Section 2.2 hereof). For purposes of this Section 4, the term "REGISTRATION
EXPENSES" shall mean all expenses incurred by the Company in complying with this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees,
exchange listing fees, printing expenses, fees and expenses of counsel for the
Company and the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel selected by the
selling Rights Holders to represent the selling Rights Holders, state Blue Sky
fees and expenses, and the expense of any special audits incidental to or
required by any such registration, but excluding underwriting discounts, selling
commissions and the fees and expenses of any selling Rights Holder's own
counsel, or other out-of-pocket expenses of the Rights Holders or their agents
(other than the counsel selected to represent all selling Rights Holders).

5.       INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

         5.1      In the event of any registration under the Securities Act of
any Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will indemnify
and hold harmless the seller of such Registrable Shares, each underwriter of
such Registrable Shares, and each other person, if any, who controls such seller
or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
such seller, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or Blue Sky laws or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which such Registrable Shares were registered under the Securities Act,
any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained in the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; and the Company will reimburse such seller, underwriter
and each such controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably
incurred by such seller, underwriter or controlling person in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as
and when incurred by them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission made
in such

                                       A-8
<PAGE>
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or any such
amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished to the Company, in writing, by or on behalf of such seller,
underwriter or controlling person specifically for use in the preparation
thereof; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with
respect to any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable
Securities shall not inure to the benefit of any seller in such offering, its
officers, directors or agents, or controlling persons if:

                  (a)   a copy of a prospectus (as then amended or supplemented
if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) for
such offering was not sent or given by or on behalf of such selling shareholder
to the person ("ASSERTING PERSON") asserting any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities as a result of an untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities
(as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments
or supplements thereto) or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and if such prospectus (as so amended or
supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities; or

                  (b)   such selling shareholder sold Registrable Securities to
the Asserting Person during the period between the date of a Suspension Notice
and the date of an End of Suspension Notice.

         5.2      In the event of any registration under the Securities Act of
any of the Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement, each seller of
Registrable Shares, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, each of its directors and officers and each underwriter (if any)
and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any such underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company, such
directors and officers, underwriter or controlling person may become subject
under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, state securities or Blue Sky laws or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which such Registrable Shares were registered under the Securities Act,
any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained in the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, or
arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information relating to such seller furnished in writing
to the Company by or on behalf of such seller specifically for use in connection
with the preparation of such Registration Statement, prospectus, amendment or
supplement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the obligations of such Rights Holders
hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to each Rights
Holder of Registrable Shares sold in connection with such registration. The
terms of any underwriting agreement entered into by the Company to effect a
registration of the Registrable Securities shall require the underwriter to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, controlling
persons and agents and each selling Rights Holder on substantially

                                       A-9
<PAGE>
the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Company by each selling
holder as provided in this Section 5.

         5.3      Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 5
("INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification ("INDEMNIFYING PARTY") promptly after such Indemnified Party has
actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 5 (except to the extent
such failure to give notice has resulted in increased losses, damages or
liabilities for the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party may participate
in such defense at such party's expense and the Indemnified Party and not the
Indemnifying Party shall bear or be responsible for the expenses thereof,
unless:

                  (a)   the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, or

                  (b)   the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party
of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, and no
Indemnified Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or settle such claim or
litigation without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         5.4      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to
joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either:

                  (a)   any holder of Registrable Shares exercising rights under
this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 but it is judicially determined (by
the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that
such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact
that this Section 5 provides for indemnification in such case; or

                  (b)   contribution under the Securities Act may be required on
the part of any such selling Rights Holder or any such controlling person in
circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 5;

then, in each such case, the Company and such Rights Holder will contribute to
the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be
subject (after contribution from others) in such proportions as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties
in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims,

                                      A-10
<PAGE>
damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in any such case:

                        (i)       no such holder will be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the proceeds to it of all Registrable Shares sold by it
pursuant to such Registration Statement; and

                        (ii)      no person or entity guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation, within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act,
shall be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who is not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

6.       INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO UNDERWRITTEN OFFERING

In the event that Registrable Shares are sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement in an underwritten offering, the Company agrees to enter into an
underwriting agreement containing customary representations and warranties with
respect to the business and operations of an issuer of the securities being
registered and customary covenants and agreements to be performed by such
issuer, including, without limitation, customary provisions with respect to
indemnification by the Company of the underwriters of such offering.

7.       INFORMATION BY RIGHTS HOLDER

         Each Rights Holder including Registrable Shares in any registration
shall furnish to the Company such information regarding such Rights Holder and
the distribution of such Right Holder's Registrable Shares proposed by such
Rights Holder as the Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be
required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance
referred to in this Agreement.

8.       INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

9.       NO LIMITATIONS ON SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
granting to any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company
registration rights which would allow such holder or prospective holder to
include securities of the Company in any Registration Statement filed by the
Company.

9.       RULE 144 REQUIREMENTS

         The Company agrees to:

                  (a)   comply with the requirements of Rule 144(c) under the
Securities Act with respect to current public information about the Company;

                  (b)   to file with the Commission in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting
requirements); and

                                      A-11
<PAGE>
                  (c)   furnish to any holder of Registrable Shares upon
request:

                        (i)       a written statement by the Company as to its
compliance with the requirements of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act, and
the reporting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any
time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements);

                        (ii)      a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Company; and

                        (iii)     such other reports and documents of the
Company as such holder may reasonably request to avail itself of any similar
rule or regulation of the Commission allowing it to sell any such securities
without registration.

11.      TERMINATION

         All of the Company's obligations to register Registrable Shares under
this Agreement shall terminate upon the last to occur of (i) the sale of all
Registrable Shares by the Rights Holders thereof pursuant to this Agreement or
(ii) the earliest date as of which all Registrable Shares have ceased being
Registrable Shares.

12.      TRANSFERS OF RIGHTS

         This Agreement, and the rights and obligations of each Rights Holder
hereunder, may only be assigned (including assignment by law) by such Rights
Holder to:

                  (a)   any family member or trust for the benefit of the
Rights Holder, if the Rights Holder is an individual; and

                        (i)       any entity controlled by, controlling or under
common control with the Rights Holder;

PROVIDED that the transferee provides written notice of such assignment to the
Company and agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof.

13.      OTHER PUBLIC OFFERINGS

         This Agreement is not intended to and shall not preclude the Company
from listing its Common Stock on any reputable non-United States exchange.

14.      NOTICES

         Each notice relating to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
delivered in person, by overnight air carrier, by registered or certified mail,
by facsimile transmission or by email, to the parties at the following addresses
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice,
provided that notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon
