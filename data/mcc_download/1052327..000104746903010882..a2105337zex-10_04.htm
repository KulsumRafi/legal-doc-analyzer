motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the success of the Company, and any of its Parent and Subsidiaries, by offering them an opportunity to participate
in the Company's future performance through awards of Options, Restricted Stock and Stock Bonuses. Capitalized terms not defined in the text are defined in Section&nbsp;23. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Number of Shares Available</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to Sections 2.2 and 18, the total number of Shares reserved and
available for grant and issuance pursuant to this Plan will be 6,000,000 Shares. Subject to Sections 2.2 and 18, Shares that: (a)&nbsp;are subject to issuance upon exercise of an Option but cease to
be subject to such Option for any reason other than exercise of such Option; (b)&nbsp;are subject to an Award granted hereunder but are forfeited or are repurchased by the Company at the original
issue price; or (c)&nbsp;are subject to an Award that otherwise terminates without Shares being issued, will again be available for grant and issuance in connection with future Awards under this
Plan. Any authorized shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the Company's 1995 Combined Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the "Prior Plan") on the Effective Date (as
defined below) and any shares that are issuable upon exercise of options granted pursuant to the Prior Plan that expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full,
will no longer be available for grant and issuance under the Prior Plan, but will be available for grant and issuance under this Plan. In addition, any shares issued under the Prior Plan which are
repurchased or forfeited will be available for grant and issuance under this Plan. At all times the Company shall reserve and keep available a
sufficient number of Shares as shall be required to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Options granted under this Plan and all other outstanding but unvested Awards granted under this Plan. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Adjustment of Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the number of outstanding shares is changed by a stock dividend,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company without consideration, then (a)&nbsp;the
number of Shares reserved for issuance under this Plan, (b)&nbsp;the Exercise Prices of and number of Shares subject to outstanding Options, and (c)&nbsp;the number of Shares subject to other
outstanding Awards will be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and compliance with applicable securities laws; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,
that fractions of a Share will not be issued but will either be replaced by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such
fraction of a Share or will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, as determined by the Committee. </FONT></P>

respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or under any other incentive stock option plan of the Company, Parent or Subsidiary
of the Company) will not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of Shares on the date of grant with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar
year exceeds $100,000, then the Options for the first $100,000 worth of Shares to become exercisable in such calendar year will be ISOs and the Options for the amount in excess of $100,000 that become
exercisable in that calendar year will be NQSOs. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the Effective Date of this Plan to provide for a different limit
on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISOs, such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of
such amendment. </FONT></P>

Option previously granted. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered will be treated in accordance with Section&nbsp;424(h) of the Code. The Committee may reduce

If the Stock Bonus is being earned upon the satisfaction of performance goals pursuant to a Performance Stock Bonus Agreement, then the Committee will: (a)&nbsp;determine the nature, length and

of Shares may be fixed or may vary in accordance with such performance goals and criteria as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may adjust the performance goals applicable to the Stock
Bonuses to take into account changes in law and accounting or tax rules and to make such adjustments as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the impact of extraordinary or unusual
