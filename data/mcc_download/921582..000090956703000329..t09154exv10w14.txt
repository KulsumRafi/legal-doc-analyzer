(b)               "Without Cause" means termination of the Executive's

4.1      Termination Without Cause

4.1.1    General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 6, if,
prior to the expiration of the Employment Term, the Executive's employment is
terminated by the Company Without Cause, the Company shall pay the Termination
Payment then due to be paid within 30 days of the date of termination and shall
continue to pay the Executive the Base Salary, automobile allowance and
Executive's target bonus (the "Target Bonus") (on a prorated basis) pursuant to
the terms of the management bonus plan referred to in Section 2.2, for the
remainder of the Employment Term (such period being referred to hereinafter as
the "Severance Period"), either at such intervals as the same would have been
paid had the Executive remained in the active service of the Company including
the applicable portion of the Target Bonus, or, at the option of the Company, by
immediate payment to the Executive of the remaining Base Salary, automobile
allowance and Target Bonus which would be payable during the Severance Period,
provided however that the Severance Period shall be a minimum of six months in
duration. Upon such termination, the Executive shall also be entitled to
continue to receive his employment benefits referred to in Section 3.1 at the
Company's expense (to the extent paid for by the Company as at the date of
termination) and subject to the consent of the applicable insurers.

to be made during the Severance Period the benefit plan contributions which are
to be made by the

Executive during the Severance Period in accordance with the terms of all
benefit plans for the minimum period prescribed by law. The Executive shall have
no further right to receive any other compensation or benefits after such
termination of employment except as are necessary under the terms of the
Executive benefit plans or programs of the Company or as required by applicable
law. Payment of Base Salary, automobile allowance and Target Bonus and the
continuation of the aforementioned Executive benefits during the Severance
Period as outlined above shall be deemed to include all termination and
severance pay to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to applicable statute
law and common law. The date of termination of employment Without Cause shall be
the date specified in a written notice of termination to the Executive and does
not include the Severance Period.

4.1.2    Fair and Reasonable The parties confirm that notice and pay in lieu of
notice provisions contained in Subsection 4.1.1 are fair and reasonable and the
parties agree that upon any termination of this Agreement Without Cause, the
Executive shall have no action, cause of action, claim or demand against the
Company or Imax or any other person as a consequence of such termination other
than to enforce Section 4.1.1.

4.1.3    Conditions Applicable to the Severance Period. If, during the Severance
Period, the Executive breaches his obligations under Article 7 of this
Agreement, the Company may, upon written notice to the Executive, terminate the
Severance Period and cease to make any further payments or provide further
benefits as described in Section 4.1.1.

4.2      Termination for Cause; Resignation. At any time prior to the expiration
of the Employment Term the Executive's employment may be terminated by the
Company immediately upon notice for Cause. If, prior to the expiration of the
Employment Term, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause, or the Executive resigns from his employment hereunder, the Executive
shall only be paid, within 15 days of the date of such termination or
resignation, the Termination Payment, then due to be paid. The Executive shall
have no further right to receive any other compensation or benefits after such
termination or resignation of employment, except as determined in accordance
with the terms of the Executive benefit plans or programs of the Company. The
date of termination for Cause shall be the date specified in a written notice of

termination. The date of resignation shall be sixty (60) days following the date

                  the Executive's reasonable control;

         (ii)     any act or omission that constitutes a material breach by the
                  Executive of any of his obligations under this Agreement,
                  which breach has not been remedied within thirty (30) days

                  the Executive by the Company;

         (iii)    the continued failure or refusal of the Executive to perform
                  the duties reasonably required of him as Senior Vice

         (iv)     any material violation by the Executive of any Canadian or

                  regulation applicable to the business of the Company or Imax,
                  which violation is injurious to the financial condition or
                  business reputation of the Company or Imax, or the Executive's
                  conviction of a felony or commission of an indictable offense

                  Executive of a common law fraud;

                  injurious to the financial condition or business reputation
                  of, or is otherwise materially injurious to, the Company or
                  Imax, or which results in a violation by the Company or Imax

                  local law or regulation applicable to the business of the
                  Company or Imax, which violation is injurious to the financial
                  condition or business reputation of the Company or Imax.

Executive will immediately cease to be an Officer of the Company and Imax
Corporation and will sign appropriate forms of resignation indicating this.

                  In the event of termination of employment by reason of death

by the Company under Section 4.1.1 (other than the Termination Payment) will be
reduced by a total of one-half (1/2) of the amount of such payment prior to the
Executive's obtaining new employment or remunerative activity. The Executive
shall be required as a condition of any payment under Section 4.1.1 (other than
the Termination Payment) promptly to disclose to the Company any such mitigation
compensation.

7.1      Non-solicitation. For so long as the Executive is employed by the

prior written consent of the Company and Imax, directly or indirectly, for the

proprietor, member of a partnership, stockholder or investor (other than a
stockholder or investor owning not more than a 5% interest), officer or director
of a corporation, or as a trustee, executive, associate, consultant, principal
or agent of any person, partnership, corporation or other business organization
or entity other than the Company or Imax: (x) solicit or endeavour to entice

customer or client) of the Company and/or Imax and with whom the Executive had
dealings during his employment with the Company. The Executive confirms that all
restrictions in this Section are reasonable and valid and waives all defences to
the strict enforcement thereof.

7.2      Non-Competition For so long as the Executive is employed by the Company
or receiving payment hereunder and continuing for a period of two years after
the date of the termination of the employment of the Executive with the Company,
notwithstanding whether the Executive's employment is terminated with or without
Cause or whether the Executive resigns, the Executive shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company and Imax, directly or indirectly anywhere
within Canada, the United States, Europe or Asia, as a sole proprietor, member
of a partnership, stockholder or investor (other than a stockholder or investor
owning not more than a 5% interest), officer or director of a corporation, or as
a trustee, Executive, associate, consultant, principal or agent of any person,
partnership, corporation or other business organization or entity other than
Imax, render any service to or in any way be affiliated with a competitor (or
any person or entity that is, at the time the Executive would otherwise commence
rendering services to or become, affiliated with such person or entity,
reasonably anticipated to become a competitor) of Imax (a "Competitor"), which
is engaged or reasonably anticipated to become engaged in designing or supplying
large format theatres, designing or distributing projection or sound systems for
large format theatres, designing or supplying motion simulation attractions or
producing or distributing films specifically for large format theatres or motion

enforcement thereof.

<PAGE>

                                      -10-

7.3      Confidentiality. The Executive covenants and agrees with Imax that he
will not at any time during employment hereunder or thereafter, except in
performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder or with the prior
written consent of the senior operation officer of the Company, directly or
indirectly, disclose or use any secret or confidential information that he may
learn or has learned by reason of his association with Imax. The term
"confidential information' includes information not previously disclosed to the
public or to the trade by Imax's management, or otherwise in the public domain,
with respect to Imax's products, facilities, applications and methods, trade
secrets and other intellectual property, systems, procedures, manuals,
confidential reports, product price lists, customer lists, technical
information, financial information, business plans, prospects or opportunities,
but shall exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to the
public or is generally known in the industry or industries in which Imax
operates other than as a result of disclosure by the Executive in violation of
his agreements under this Section 7.3 or (ii) the Executive is required to
disclose under any applicable laws, regulations or directives of any government
agency, tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the matter or under
subpoena or other process of law. The Executive confirms that all restrictions
in this Section 7.3 are reasonable and valid and waives all defences to the
strict enforcement thereof.

7.4      Exclusive Property. The Executive confirms that all confidential
information is and shall remain the exclusive property of Imax. All business
records, papers and documents regardless of the form of their records kept or
made by Executive relating to the business of Imax shall be and remain the
property of Imax, and shall be promptly returned by the Executive to Imax upon
any termination of employment.

7.5      Injunctive Relief. Without intending to limit the remedies available to
Imax, the Executive acknowledges that a material breach of any of the covenants
contained in Article 7 will result in material and irreparable injury to Imax
for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to
measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a
breach or threat thereof, Imax shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining
order and/or a preliminary, interim or permanent injunction restraining the
Executive from engaging in activities prohibited by Article 7 or such other
relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants in
Article 7. The Executive waives any defences to the strict enforcement by Imax
of the covenants contained in Article 7. If for any reason it is held that the
restrictions under Article 7 are not reasonable or that consideration therefor
is inadequate, such restrictions shall be interpreted or modified to include as
much of the duration and scope identified in Article 7 as will render such
restrictions valid and enforceable.

7.6      Representation. The Executive represents and warrants that he is not
subject to any non-competition covenant or any other agreement with any party
which would in any manner restrict or limit his ability to render the services
required of him hereunder.

8.2      Severability. Each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The parties agree that Sections
4, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

8.3      Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the heirs and representatives of the Executive and the assigns and
successors of the Company and Imax, if any are permitted by law and provided
that the Company and Imax and its assignee shall each remain liable to the
Executive in the event of any assignment, but neither this Agreement nor any
rights hereunder shall be assignable or otherwise subject to hypothecation by
the Executive. The Executive expressly agrees that each of Imax and the Company
my assigne any of its rights, interest or obligations hereunder to any affiliate
of either of them without the consent of the Executive; provide, however, that
no such assignment shall relieve the assignor of any of its obligations
hereunder.

8.4      Entire Agreement: Amendment. This Agreement represents the entire
agreement of the parties and shall supersede any and all previous contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the Company and the Executive. This
Agreement may only be amended at any time by mutual written agreement of the
parties hereto.

8.5      Withholding. The payment of any amount pursuant to this Agreement shall
be subject to any applicable withholding and payroll taxes, and such other
deductions as may be required under applicable law or the Company's Executive
benefit plans, if any.

                                    ADDENDUM

For purposes of clarity and so as to avoid any confusion (and effective as of
the Commencement Date), the term "termination Without Cause" as used in this
Agreement shall mean termination of the Employee's employment for any reason or
for no reason (including, but not limited to, termination of the Employee's
employment as a result of the Company's determination not to renew or extend
this Agreement), excepting solely a termination for Cause (as defined in Section
4.3) or as a result of the Employee's death or disability (as set forth in
Section 5). Moreover, for additional clarity, the provisions of Section 2.3 of
this Agreement shall apply and be effective if the event specified in clause (b)
of such Section 2.3 occurs at any time, whether or not the Employment Term has
expired, if the Executive's employment with the Company continues until such
event.
