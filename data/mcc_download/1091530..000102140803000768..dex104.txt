             (i)    Such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less
                    favorable to the Company or the relevant Subsidiary than

                         consideration in excess of $5.0 million, a resolution

             in effect on the date hereof; or

     (q)     Agreeing or committing to do any of the foregoing.

     Section 5.2    Consent Rights Non-transferable. The consent rights

                                   ARTICLE VI.

                  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER; ANTIDILUTION PROTECTION

     Section 6.1    Right of First Offer. The Company shall only issue
Non-Public Capital Stock in a Private Financing Transaction in accordance with
the following terms:

     (a)     The Company shall not issue any Non-Public Capital Stock in a
Private Financing Transaction unless it first delivers to each Investor who is
then an Eligible Purchaser (as defined below) and who, in the case of Note
Investors, purchases at least $10 million in aggregate principal amount at
maturity of New Notes at the closing of the Concurrent Financing Transactions
(each such Person being referred to in this Section 6 as a "Buyer"), a written
notice (the "Notice of Proposed Issuance") specifying the type and total number
of such shares of Non-Public Capital Stock that the Company then intends to
issue (the "Offered Non-Public Capital Stock"), all of the material terms,
including the price upon which the Company proposes to issue the Offered
Non-Public Capital Stock and stating that the Buyers shall have the right to
purchase the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock in the manner specified in this
Section 6.1 for the same price per share and in accordance with the same terms
and conditions specified in such Notice of Proposed Issuance.

     (b)     For a period of ten (10) calendar days from the date the Company
delivers to all of the Buyers the Notice of Proposed Issuance (the "Ten Day
Period"), the Buyers may elect to subscribe to purchase Offered Non-Public
Capital Stock at the same price per share and upon the same terms and conditions
specified in the Notice of Proposed Issuance. Each Buyer electing to purchase
Offered Non-Public Capital Stock must give written notice of its election to the
Company prior to the expiration of the Ten Day Period. If the Offered Non-Public
Capital Stock is being offered as part of an investment unit together with debt
or other instruments, any election by a Buyer to purchase Offered Non-Public
Capital Stock shall also constitute an election to purchase a like portion of
such debt or other instruments.

     (c)     Each Buyer shall have the right to purchase that number of shares
of the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock as shall be equal to the number of
shares of the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock then held by
such Buyer plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all
Convertible Securities then held by such Buyer and the denominator of which

                                     - 14 -

<PAGE>

shall be the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. The
amount of such Offered Non-Public Capital Stock that each Buyer is entitled to
purchase under this Section 6 shall be referred to as its "Proportionate Share."

     (d)     Each Buyer shall have a right of oversubscription such that if any
other Buyer fails to elect to purchase his or its full Proportionate Share of
the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock, the other Buyer(s) shall, among them, have
the right to purchase up to the balance of such Offered Non-Public Capital Stock
not so purchased. The Buyers may exercise such right of oversubscription by
electing to purchase more than their Proportionate Share of the Offered
Non-Public Capital Stock by so indicating in their written notice given during
the Ten Day Period. If, as a result thereof, such oversubscription elections
exceed the total number of the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock available in
respect to such oversubscription privilege, the oversubscribing Buyers shall be
cut back with respect to oversubscriptions on a pro rata basis in accordance
with their respective Proportionate Share or as they may otherwise agree among
themselves.

     (e)     If all of the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock has not been
subscribed for by the Buyers pursuant to the foregoing provisions, then the
Company shall have the right, until the expiration of one-hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days commencing on the first day immediately following the
expiration of the Ten Day Period, to issue the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock
not purchased by the Buyers at not less than, and on terms no more favorable in
any material respect to the purchaser(s) thereof than, the price and terms
specified in the Notice of Proposed Issuance. If such remaining Offered
Non-Public Capital Stock is not issued within such period and at such price and
on such terms, the right to issue in accordance with the Notice of Proposed
Issuance shall expire and the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to be
applicable to the Offered Non-Public Capital Stock.

     (f)     The Company may proceed with the issuance of Non-Public Capital
Stock without first following the foregoing procedures provided that within ten
(10) days following the issuance of such Non-Public Capital Stock, the Company
or the purchaser of the Non-Public Capital Stock undertakes steps substantially
similar to those described above to offer to all Buyers the right to purchase
from such purchaser or from the Company such amount of such Non-Public Capital
Stock at the same price and terms applicable to the purchaser's purchase thereof
as is necessary for the Buyers to maintain the same ownership percentage of the
Company on a fully diluted basis as existed prior to such issuance of Non-Public
Capital Stock.

     (g)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Right of First Offer described
in this Section 6 shall not apply with respect to the issuance of Excluded
Securities or to any Investor who is not an Eligible Purchaser. For purposes of
this Section 6, any Investor shall be an "Eligible Purchaser" with respect to a
proposed issuance of Non-Public Capital Stock if such Investor meets the
Company's reasonable requirements for investors generally (such as being an
Accredited Investor or Qualified Institutional Buyer) to purchase Non-Public
Capital Stock in the particular Private Financing Transaction.

     (h)     The rights granted under this Section 6.1 are personal to the
Investors and shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable other than to an
Affiliate of an Investor.

     Section 6.2    Antidilution Protection.

     (a)     In the event that, at a time when Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock is then outstanding, the Company grants any Antidilution Protection to any
purchaser(s) of 1% or more (on a fully diluted basis) of the Capital Stock which
would (if granted to the holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock) be
materially more favorable (taken as a whole) to the holders of the Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock than the Antidilution Protection then applicable to
the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (a "New Antidilution Protection"), then
if the holders of a majority of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock
outstanding so elect by written notice to the Company, the Company and the
Series C Investors shall use their best efforts to take all steps determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors to be reasonably necessary to provide (and
the Investors and their Permitted Transferees, other than Permitted Transferees
of Common Stock sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144
or Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) shall vote in favor of
any amendment to the Certificate of Designation of the Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock which may be necessary), as nearly as practicable under the
circumstances and consistent with the other terms of Certificate of Designation
for the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, the New Antidilution Protection to
the holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock as a replacement for the
Antidilution Protection then applicable to the Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock.

     (b)     In the event that a New Antidilution Protection is granted to the
holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock as a replacement for the
Antidilution Protection then applicable to the Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock, if the Note Investors holding a majority of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount at maturity of the New Notes so elect, the Company and the Note
Investors shall use their best efforts to take all steps determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors to be reasonably necessary to provide, as nearly
as practicable under the circumstances and consistent with the GM Note Purchase
Agreement, the New Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes and this Agreement, the
New Antidilution Protection to the Note Investors.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
