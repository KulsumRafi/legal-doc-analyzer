somehow construed or recharacterized as a loan agreement, or a line-of-credit agreement, or a promissory note, or some other credit facility.&#160; Licensee shall be entitled to exercise all rights permitted for a secured party by the California
Commercial Code.&#160; Licensee shall be entitled to file a customary UCC-1 Financing Statement with the appropriate State agencies, and Licensor and Licensee shall file with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office a customary notice of Licensee&#146;s

under this Agreement, either (i)&nbsp;Licensee will be given by the Newco Venture an equity interest in Newco equal to the Break-up Fee, or (ii)&nbsp;Licensee will be paid by the Newco Venture a cash sum equal to the Break-up Fee, with Licensee to
