additional rent. On the first day of each month following rendition of each Landlord&#146;s Projected Annual Statement, TENANT shall pay to LANDLORD, on account of the potential additional rent, a sum equal to one-twelfth (<font size=2>1</font><font

Labor Statistics. If the manner in which the Consumer Price Index is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shall be substantially revised, an adjustment shall be made in such revised index which would produce results, equivalent, as nearly as
possible, to those which would have been obtained if the Consumer Price Index had not been so revised. If the Consumer Price Index shall become unavailable to the public because publication is discontinued, or otherwise, LANDLORD will substitute
therefore a comparable index based upon changes in the cost of living or purchasing power of the consumer dollar published by any other governmental agency or, if no such index shall be available, then a comparable index published by a major bank or
other major financial institution or by a major university. The CPI applies to Base Rent only.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Operating Expense is on an actual basis.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;

written notice thereof, or if such default is of a nature that it cannot be completely remedied within said fifteen (15) day period, and TENANT shall not commence within said fifteen (15) days and shall not thereafter diligently procure to
completion all steps necessary to remedy such default;</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>3. If a petition in bankruptcy shall be filed by or against TENANT or if TENANT shall make a general

days;</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>5. If an execution or attachment shall be issued under which the Demised Premises shall be taken or occupied or attempted to be taken or occupied by
anyone other than TENANT;</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>6. If the Demised Premises become and remain vacant, deserted or abandoned for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days;</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>7. If the Demised Premises are used for some purpose other than the use specifically authorized herein.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font

margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>1. LANDLORD may re-enter the Demised Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise and re-let the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, as TENANT&#146;S agent, in the name of LANDLORD or otherwise for a term shorter or
longer than the balance of the term of this Lease, and may grant concessions of free rent, make improvements to the Demised Premises, and may grant any other concessions in connection therewith as are necessary to re-let the Demised Premises. In
computing the net amount of rents collected through such re-letting, LANDLORD may deduct all reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining repossession or re-letting the Demised Premises, including rent concessions, attorney&#146;s fees, brokerage fees,
the cost of restoring or improving the Demised Premises, and the cost of all alterations and decorations deemed necessary by LANDLORD to effect re-letting. In no event shall TENANT be entitled to a credit or repayment for re-rental income which
exceeds the sums payable by TENANT hereunder.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>2. LANDLORD may give TENANT fifteen (15) days notice of termination of this Lease. Upon the expiration of the
fifteen (15) day notice period, this Lease and any rights of renewal or extension thereof shall come to an end and shall terminate as if that were the date originally fixed for the expiration of the term of this LEASE, but TENANT shall remain liable
as hereinafter provided.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>3. LANDLORD may accelerate and claim and demand, as liquidated and agreed upon damages, immediate payment of a sum equal to the
amount by which the Base Rent and all forms of additional rent (as reasonably estimated by LANDLORD), due for the remainder of the term of this Lease and any extensions thereof which may have been exercised by TENANT, exceeds the then fair and
reasonable rental value of the Demised Premises for the same period, both discounted to present worth at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum. If, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any court, commission or tribunal,
the Demised Premises or any part thereof shall have been re-let by LANDLORD for the period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion of the term or any part thereof, the amount of rent reserved upon such re-letting shall be
deemed, prima facie, to be the fair and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the Demised Premises so re-let during the term of the re-letting.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font
size=2>4. LANDLORD may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>10. LIENS:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>A. TENANT
herein shall not have any authority to create any liens for labor or material on LANDLORD&#146;S interest in the land, building or Demised Premises. All materialmen, contractors, mechanics, and laborers, and all persons contracting with TENANT, are
hereby charged with notice that they must look only to TENANT and TENANT&#146;S interests in the Demised Premises to secure any payment. At LANDLORD&#146;S request, TENANT agrees to obtain and deliver to LANDLORD written and unconditional waivers
and releases of any such liens.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>B. TENANT agrees that TENANT will pay all charges of contractors, subcontractors, mechanics, laborers, materialmen and other items of like
character incurred by TENANT with respect to the Demised Premises, and will indemnify, defend and hold LANDLORD harmless from and against any and all expenses, costs and charges, including bond premiums for release of liens and reasonable
attorney&#146;s fees incurred in connection with the defense of any suit in discharging the said Demised Premises or any part thereof from any liens, judgments or encumbrances caused or suffered by TENANT. In the event any such lien shall be made or
filed, TENANT shall bond against or discharge the same within ten (10) days after the same has been made or filed. It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that the expenses, costs and charges referred to above shall be considered as
additional rent and shall be included in any lien for rent.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>11. CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF TENANT:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>A.

terminate this Lease in the event of TENANT&#146;S incapacity, death or cessation of day-to-day management upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to TENANT or his legal representative.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;

actual insurance policy and any amendments and endorsements thereto or a certificate of insurance clearly evidencing each of the coverages and provisions set forth in this section. Upon TENANT&#146;S default in obtaining or delivering the policy or
certificate for any such insurance or TENANT&#146;S failure to pay the charges therefore, LANDLORD may, but shall not be obligated, to procure or pay the charges for any such policies and charge the TENANT therefore as additional rent.</font></p> <p

or damages, which may be imposed upon LANDLORD by reason of TENANT&#146;S failure to comply with the provisions of section B of clause 12 of this Lease and if, by reason of such failure, the fire insurance shall at the beginning of this Lease or at
any time thereafter be higher than it otherwise would be, then TENANT shall reimburse LANDLORD, as additional rent hereunder, for that portion of all fire insurance premiums thereafter paid by LANDLORD which shall have been charged because of such
failure by TENANT.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>13. SUBROGATION</font><b><font size=2>:</font></b></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>LANDLORD and TENANT and their successors or

which Tenant may be required to carry out pursuant to the terms hereof may, at LANDLORD&#146;S option, be made by LANDLORD at the expense of TENANT, and the expenses thereof incurred by LANDLORD shall be collectible as additional rent after the
rendition of a bill or statement therefore.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>B. TENANT shall make no alterations or improvements to the Demised Premises without LANDLORD&#146;S prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. All installations or work done by or on behalf of TENANT shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and shall at all times comply with all laws, rules, orders and regulations of all governmental authorities having
or asserting jurisdiction in all connection therewith; and with the rules and regulations of LANDLORD. TENANT shall obtain, at its expense all necessary governmental approvals and permits.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;
margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>17. FIXTURES AND INSTALLATIONS:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>All appurtenances, fixtures, improvements, additions and other property attached to or built into the Demised
Premises, whether by LANDLORD or TENANT or others, and whether at LANDLORD&#146;S expense, or TENANT&#146;S expense, or the joint expense of LANDLORD and TENANT, shall become and remain the property of LANDLORD, and shall remain upon and be
surrendered with the Demised Premises, unless LANDLORD, by notice to TENANT no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed as the termination of this lease, elects to have them removed by TENANT, in which event the same shall be removed by
TENANT at TENANT&#146;S expense. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to prevent TENANT&#146;S removal of trade fixtures but, upon removal of any such trade fixtures from the Demised Premises or upon the removal of other installations as may be
required by LANDLORD, TENANT shall immediately, at its expense, repair and restore the Demised Premises to the condition existing prior to installation and shall repair any damage to the Demised Premises or the Building due to such removal. All
property permitted or required to be removed by TENANT at the end of the term, which remains in the Demised Premises after TENANT&#146;S removal, shall be deemed abandoned and may, at the election of LANDLORD, either be retained as LANDLORD&#146;S
property or may be removed from the Demised Premises at TENANT&#146;S expense.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>18. CONDITION OF PREMISES:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font
size=2>TENANT&#146;S taking possession of the Demised Premises shall be conclusive evidence as against TENANT that the Demised Premises were in good order and satisfactory condition when the TENANT took possession. At the termination of this Lease,
the TENANT shall return the Demised Premises broom-clean and in as good condition as when the TENANT took possession, ordinary wear and tear or loss by fire or other</font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center'><font size=2>

  <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>casualty excepted, failing which the LANDLORD may restore the Demised Premises to such condition and the TENANT shall pay the cost thereof on demand. The air
conditioning, heating, electrical and plumbing systems should be in good working order prior to TENANT taking possession.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>19. SECURITY DEPOSIT:</font></p> <p style='
margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>TENANT has deposited with LANDLORD the sum of $ -0- as security for the full and faithful performance of every provision of this Lease to be performed by TENANT. If TENANT defaults with respect to any
provision of this Lease, including but not limited to the provisions relating to the payment of Rent, LANDLORD may use, apply or retain all or any part of this security deposit for the payment of any Rent or other sum in default or for the payment
of any other amount which LANDLORD may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of TENANT&#146;S default, or to compensate LANDLORD for any other loss, cost or damage which LANDLORD may suffer by reason of TENANT&#146;S default. If any portion
of said deposit is so used or applied, TENANT shall, within five (5) days after written demand therefore, deposit cash with LANDLORD in an amount sufficient to restore the security deposit to its original amount and TENANT&#146;S failure to do so
shall constitute a breach of this Lease. LANDLORD shall not, unless required by law, be required to pay interest on the security deposit to the TENANT. If TENANT shall fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease, the security deposit
or any balance thereof shall be returned to TENANT (or at LANDLORD&#146;S option, to the last transferee of TENANT&#146;S interest hereunder) within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the Lease term, provided TENANT has vacated the premises.
In the event the building is sold, the security deposit will be transferred to the new owner.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>20. SIGNAGE:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font
size=2>TENANT is allowed to display the name of its business on the front door of its Demised Premises; the front door is defined as being on the east side of the building. The location and type of signs shall be mutually agreed upon by TENANT and
LANDLORD. The TENANT shall not display, inscribe, print, paint, maintain or affix on any place about the building any sign, notice, legend, direction, figure or advertisement, except on the front door of the Demised Premises and on the directory
board, and then only such name(s) and matter, and in such color, size, style, place and materials as shall first have been approved by LANDLORD. The listing of any name other than that of TENANT, whether on the front door of the Demised Premises or
on the directory board, shall not vest any interest in the Lease or in the Demised Premises, it being expressly understood that any such listing is a privilege extended by LANDLORD revocable at will by written notice to TENANT.</font></p> <p style='
margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>21. HOLDING OVER:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>If the TENANT retains possession of the premises or any part thereof after the termination date of this Lease,
the TENANT shall pay to the LANDLORD rent at double the monthly rate payable by the TENANT with respect to the last full calendar month prior to the termination date of this Lease for the time the TENANT remains in possession and, in addition
thereto, shall pay the LANDLORD for all damages, consequential as well as direct, sustained by reason of the TENANT&#146;S retention of possession.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>22. CERTIFICATES:</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>A. TENANT will, within 10 (ten) days of written request from LANDLORD, certify in writing to LANDLORD&#146;S designee (i) whether or not the lease has been modified or amended; (ii) the
date to which rent has been paid; and (iii) whether TENANT has any knowledge of LANDLORD&#146;S default hereunder.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>B. LANDLORD will, within 10 (ten) days of written request from
TENANT, certify in writing to TENANT&#146;S designee (i) whether or not the Lease has been modified or amended; (ii) the date to which rent has been paid; and (iii) whether LANDLORD has any knowledge of TENANT&#146;S default hereunder.</font></p> <p
style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>23. CONDEMNATION:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>LANDLORD reserves unto itself, and TENANT assigns to LANDLORD, all right to damages accruing on
account of any taking or condemnation of any part of the building, or by reason of any act of any public or quasi-public authority for which damages are payable. TENANT agrees to execute such instruments or assignments as may be required by
LANDLORD, to join with LANDLORD in any petition for the recovery of damages if requested by LANDLORD, and LANDLORD agrees to turn over to TENANT its proportionate share of any such damages that may be recovered in any such proceeding. LANDLORD does
not reserve for itself, and TENANT does not assign to LANDLORD, any damages payable for trade fixtures installed by TENANT at its cost and expense and which are not part of the realty, or any moving expense, relocation expense, or loss of business
claim.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>24. SUBORDINATION OF LEASE:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>This Lease is and shall be subject and subordinate to any and all
mortgages or deeds of trust now existing upon or that may be hereafter placed upon the Demised Premises or the property and to all advances made or to be made thereon, and all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or extensions
thereof and the lien of such mortgages, deed of trust and land leases shall be superior to all rights hereby and hereunder vested in TENANT, to the full extent of all sums secured hereby. This provision shall be self-operative and no further
instrument of subordination shall be necessary to effectuate such subordination and the recording of any such mortgage or deed of trust shall have preference</font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center'><font size=2>

request of LANDLORD or the holder of any such mortgage or deed of trust execute and deliver to LANDLORD within ten (10) days any instrument that LANDLORD or such holder may reasonably request. Should any prospective mortgagee or ground lessor
require a modification of this Lease, which modification will not cause an increased cost or expense to TENANT or in any other way materially change the rights and obligations of TENANT hereunder in the reasonable judgment of TENANT, then and in
such event, TENANT agrees that this Lease may be so modified and agrees to promptly execute whatever documents are required therefore. Should any prospective mortgagee or ground lessor require execution of a short form of lease for recording
(containing the names of the parties, a description of the Demised Premises, and the term of this Lease) or a certification from the TENANT concerning the Lease in such form as may be required by a prospective mortgagee or ground lessor, TENANT
agrees to promptly execute such short form of lease or certificate and deliver same to LANDLORD within ten (10) days following the request therefore.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>25. NOTICES:</font></p> <p
style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>All notices required or contemplated by this Lease shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or by special courier or by United States Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested,
addressed to the party to whom such notice is directed at the address as shown in this lease or such other address as either LANDLORD or TENANT may designate as its new address for notice purposes. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been
rendered or given on the date when it shall have been mailed as provided in this clause.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>26. APPLICABLE LAW:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font
size=2>This lease is entered into in the State of Florida and shall be governed by the applicable law of such State.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>27. ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</font></p> <p style='
margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>This Lease contains the entire agreement between the parties. No oral or written statement or representation shall be binding upon either party unless expressly set forth in this Lease. This Lease may
not be modified unless such agreement is set forth in writing by LANDLORD and TENANT. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, LANDLORD and TENANT have duly executed this agreement as of the day and year first above written.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;
