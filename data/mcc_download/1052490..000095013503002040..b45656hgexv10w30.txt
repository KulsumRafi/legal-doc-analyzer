Dear Jerry:

This letter agreement (this "Letter Agreement") sets forth certain agreements
between The Holmes Group, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Corporation"),
and Jordan A. Kahn (the "Executive") with respect to the Executive Employment
and Non-Competition Agreement dated February 1, 2002 by and between the
Corporation and the Executive (the "Agreement"). In consideration of the mutual
promises contained herein and in the Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged),
the Corporation and the Executive hereby agree to amend the Agreement as
follows:

      1.    By deleting from Section 2 of the Agreement the dates "January 31,
            2003" and "November 30, 2002" and by substituting in their
            respective stead the following dates: "January 31, 2004" and
            "November 30, 2003";

      2.    By deleting in its entirety the last sentence of Section 5 of the
            Agreement and by substituting in its stead the following: "As used
            herein, the term `Bonus Base' shall mean Five Hundred Thousand
            Dollars ($500,000)."; and

      3.    By deleting in its entirety the first sentence of Section 10.01 of
            the Agreement and by substituting in its stead the following:

            "In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
            without Cause, or due to the death or Permanent Disability of the
            Executive, or terminated by the Executive for any reason, or if this
            Agreement is not extended at the end of the Term, the Executive
            shall receive as a termination settlement the sum of Three Hundred
            Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($375,000) (the "Termination Payment")
            payable in a lump sum within seven (7) days after the effective date
            of termination."

By its or his respective signature below, each of the Corporation and the
Executive hereby acknowledges and affirms that, (i) except as amended by this
Letter Agreement, all provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and
effect, and (ii) this Letter Agreement shall be deemed a part thereof for all
purposes.
