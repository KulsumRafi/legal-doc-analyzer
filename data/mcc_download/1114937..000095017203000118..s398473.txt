2.2      Purpose and Application
         The:

         2.2.1    Original Term Facility was intended, and was applied, for
                  the following purposes: (a) to finance the acquisition by
                  the Principal Borrower of that part of the Cablecom Business
                  not acquired by NTL SPV Inc. and transferred to the
                  Shareholder and the Principal Borrower pursuant to the
                  Hivedown, (b) to refinance the existing indebtedness (other
                  than Permitted Financial Indebtedness) of the Borrowers and
                  (c) to finance, in an amount of up to CHF30,000,000, working
                  capital of the Borrowers; and

         2.2.2    Revolving Facility is intended to finance operating
                  expenses, working capital and other capital expenditure of
                  the members of the Restricted Group and for such members'
                  general corporate financing requirements and, accordingly,
                  each Borrower shall ensure all amounts raised by it
                  hereunder are applied in or towards satisfaction of such
                  operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital
                  expenditure or (as the case may be) general corporate
                  financing requirements and none of the Finance Parties shall
                  be obliged to concern themselves with such application.

2.3      Conditions Precedent
         The conditions precedent to availability of the Facilities (being the
         documents and other evidence listed in Schedule 3 (Conditions
         Precedent) have been satisfied.

2.4      Banks' Obligations Several
         The obligations of each Bank are several and the failure by a Bank to
         perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the obligations of
         an Obligor towards any other party hereto nor shall any other party
         be liable for the failure by such Bank to perform its obligations
         hereunder.

2.5      Banks' Rights Several
         The rights of each Bank are several and any debt arising hereunder at
         any time from an Obligor to any of the other parties hereto shall be
         a separate and independent debt. Each such party shall be entitled to
         protect and enforce its individual rights arising out of this
         Agreement independently of any other party (so that it shall not be
         necessary for any party hereto to be joined as an additional party in
         any proceedings for this purpose).

3.       UTILISATION OF THE ORIGINAL TERM FACILITY

         The Original Term Facility has been utilised in full.

4.       INTEREST PERIODS FOR ORIGINAL TERM ADVANCES

4.1      Original Term Advance Interest Periods
         The period for which an Original Term Advance is outstanding shall be
         divided into successive periods each of which (other than the first,
         which shall begin on the day such Original Term Advance is made)
         shall start on the last day of the preceding such period.

4.2      Original Term Advance Interest Period Duration
         The duration of each Interest Period in respect of an Original Term
         Advance shall, save as otherwise provided herein, be one, two, three
         or six months or such other period as the

                                     -32-
<page>

         Agent (acting on the instructions of all of the Banks) may agree,
         in each case as the Borrower to which such Original Term Advance is
         made may during the Notice Period, or such other period as the Agent
         may agree, by written notice to the Agent select (or, as the case may
         be, request and agree), provided that:

         4.2.1    if such Borrower fails to give such notice of its selection
                  in relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that
                  Interest Period shall, subject to sub-clauses 4.2.2 and
                  4.2.3 be three months;

         4.2.2    any Interest Period in respect of an Original Term Advance
                  which begins at the same time as any other Interest Period
                  in respect of an Original Term Advance borrowed by the same
                  Borrower shall end at the same time as that other Interest
                  Period; and

         4.2.3    any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the
                  month preceding, or extend beyond, the Termination Date
                  shall be of such duration that it shall end on the
                  Termination Date.

4.3      Consolidation of Original Term Advances
         If two Interest Periods relating to Original Term Advances end at the
         same time and such Original Term Advances have been made to the same
         Borrower then, on the last day of those Interest Periods, the
         Original Term Advances to which they relate shall be consolidated
         into and treated as a single Original Term Advance.

4.4      Division of Original Term Advances
         The Borrower to which an Original Term Advance is made may, by not
         less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent,
         direct that such Original Term Advance shall, at the beginning of any
         Interest Period relating thereto, be divided into (and thereafter,
         save as otherwise provided herein, treated in all respects as) two or
         more Original Term Advances in such amounts (in aggregate, equalling
         the amount of the Original Term Advance being so divided) as shall be
         specified by such Borrower in such notice, provided that such
         Borrower shall not be entitled to make such a direction if:

         4.4.1    as a result of so doing, there would be more than four
                  outstanding Original Term Advances; or

         4.4.2    any Original Term Advance thereby coming into existence
                  would be of an amount less than CHF50,000,000.

5.       PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON original TERM ADVANCES

5.1      Payment of Interest
         On the last day of each Interest Period of an Original Term Advance
         (and, if the duration of an Interest Period exceeds six months, on
         the expiry of each period of six months during such Interest Period)
         the Borrower to whom such Original Term Advance has been made shall
         pay accrued interest on such Original Term Advance.

5.2      Calculation of Interest
         The rate of interest applicable to an Original Term Advance from time
         to time during an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate
         per annum which is the sum of:

         5.2.1    the Margin at such time;

                                     -33-

5.4      Margin Changes
         Any reduction or increase to the Margin provided for by Clause 5.3
         (Margin Ratchet) shall take effect in relation to all existing
         Advances and future Advances, in each case with effect from the date
         the Agent receives the Principal Borrower's Compliance Certificate in
         accordance with Clause 21.5 (Compliance Certificates) for its most
         recent Financial Quarter. Any change in the Margin applicable to an
         existing Advance shall only relate to the remainder of the current
         Interest Period or Term of such an Advance.

5.5      Default Margin
         The Margin shall be 2.50 per cent. per annum from the date determined
         by the Agent (acting reasonably) (in writing) as being the date on
         which an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred
         or come into existence until the date specified by the Agent (in
         writing) as being the date on which it has been demonstrated to its
         satisfaction (acting reasonably) that such Event of Default or
         Potential Event of Default is no longer continuing. The Agent shall
         promptly notify the other parties hereto of any determination that an
         Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred or exists
         or, as the case may be, that it has been demonstrated to its
         reasonable satisfaction that such is no longer continuing.

6.       UTILISATION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

6.1      Drawdown Conditions for Revolving Advances
         A Revolving Advance (which is not a Rollover Advance) will be made by

                            Counterparties of Hedging Liabilities the Interest
                            Account provided always that the maximum aggregate

6.2      Availability of Revolving Facility in Excess of the Facilities Cap

         6.2.1    Notwithstanding sub-clause 6.1.6 of Clause 6.1 (Drawdown
                  Conditions for Revolving Advances), the Principal Borrower
                  shall be entitled to request the making of further Revolving
                  Advances which would cause the Loan to exceed the Facilities
                  Cap provided always that the maximum amount of the Revolving
                  Loan shall not, at any time, exceed the aggregate of the
                  Revolving Commitments of the Banks.

         6.2.2    Such request shall be made by delivery of a written notice
                  from the Principal Borrower to the Agent not less than
                  fifteen Business Days prior to the proposed date for the
                  making of such further Revolving Advances. Such written
                  notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of the
                  proposed further Revolving Advances, and the proposed
                  purpose and application of the proceeds thereof.

         6.2.3    The Agent shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the
                  Banks of any notice received by it from the Principal
                  Borrower pursuant to sub-clause 6.2.2. Each Bank shall,
                  within ten Business Days of receipt of such notification
                  from the Agent, notify the Agent whether or not it consents
                  to the making of the proposed further Revolving Advances for
                  the purposes specified in such notice.

         6.2.4    A proposed further Revolving Advance which is to be applied
                  only in payment of interest due to the Banks hereunder,
                  shall require the prior written consent of an Instructing
                  Group. A proposed further Revolving Advance intended for any
                  other purpose shall require the prior written consent of all
                  the Banks.

         6.2.5    Subject to the Agent receiving the requisite consent
                  referred to in sub-clause 6.2.4, the Agent shall as soon as
                  reasonably practicable thereafter notify the Principal
                  Borrower thereof and the proposed further Revolving Advance
                  shall be made subject to and in accordance with the
                  provisions of Clause 6.1 (Drawdown Conditions for Revolving
                  Advances).

6.3      Each Bank's Participation in Revolving Advances
         Each Bank will participate through its Facility Office in each
         Revolving Advance made pursuant to this Clause 6 (Utilisation of the
         Revolving Facility) in the proportion borne by its Available
         Revolving Commitment to the Available Revolving Facility immediately
         prior to the making of that Revolving Advance.

6.4      Reduction of Available Revolving Commitment
         If a Bank's Revolving Commitment is reduced in accordance with the
         terms hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for
         a Revolving Advance and such reduction was not taken into account in
         the Available Revolving Facility, then the amount of that Revolving
         Advance shall be reduced accordingly.

7.       PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON REVOLVING ADVANCES

7.1      Payment of Interest
         On the Repayment Date relating to each Revolving Advance and, if the
         Term of such Revolving Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of
         each period of six months during such Term, the Borrower to whom such
         Revolving Advance has been made shall pay accrued interest on that
         Revolving Advance.

                                     -36-
<page>

7.2      Calculation of Interest
         The rate of interest applicable to a Revolving Advance from time to
         time during its Term shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

         7.2.1    the Margin at such time;

         7.2.2    the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

         7.2.3    LIBOR.

7.3      Margin
         The Margin for Revolving Advances shall be determined in accordance
         with Clause 5.3 (Margin Ratchet) to Clause 5.5 (Default Margin).

                  relevant Interest Period or Term none or only one of the
                  Reference Banks supplies a rate for the purpose of
                  determining LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period or Term;
                  or

         8.1.2    before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date
                  for such Advance the Agent has been notified by a Bank or
                  each of a group of Banks to whom in aggregate fifty per
                  cent. or more of such Advance is owed (or, in the case of an
                  undrawn Advance, if made, would be owed) that the LIBOR rate
                  does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
                  participation in such Advance,

         then, the Agent shall notify the Principal Borrower, the relevant
         Borrower and the Banks of such event and, notwithstanding anything to
         the contrary in this Agreement, Clause 8.2 (Substitute Interest
         Period and Interest Rate) shall apply to such Advance (if it is an
         Original Term Advance which is already outstanding or a Rollover
         Advance). If sub-clause 8.1.1 or 8.1.2 applies to a proposed Advance
         (other than a Rollover Advance), such Advance shall not be made.

8.2      Substitute Interest Period and Interest Rate
         If sub-clause 8.1.1 of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an
         Advance, the duration of the relevant Interest Period or Term shall
         be one month or, if less, such that it shall end on the Termination
         Date. If either sub-clause 8.1.1 or 8.1.2 of Clause 8.1 (Market
         Disruption) applies to an Advance, the rate of interest applicable to
         each Bank's portion of such Advance during the relevant Interest
         Period or Term shall (subject to any agreement reached pursuant to
         Clause 8.3 (Alternative Rate)) be the rate per annum which is the sum
         of:

         8.2.1    the Margin at such time;

         8.2.2    the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

         8.2.3    the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Bank before
                  the last day of such Interest Period or Term to be that
                  which expresses as a percentage rate per

                                     -37-
<page>

                  annum the cost to such Bank of funding from whatever sources
                  it may reasonably select its portion of such Advance during
                  such Interest Period or Term.

8.3      Alternative Rate
         If either of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of
         Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to an Advance, then
         if the Agent or the Principal Borrower so requires, the Agent and the
         Principal Borrower shall enter into negotiations with a view to
         agreeing a substitute basis (i) for determining the rates of interest
         from time to time applicable to the Advances and/or (ii) upon which
         the Advances may be maintained (whether in Swiss Francs or some other
         currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that is agreed
         shall take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on each
         party hereto, provided that the Agent may not agree any such
         substitute basis without the prior consent of each Bank (which is not
         to be unreasonably withheld).

9.       NOTIFICATION

         (Repayment of the Original Term Facility).

13.2     Cancellation of the Revolving Facility
         The Principal Borrower may, by giving to the Agent not less than five

13.5     Repayment of a Bank's Share of the Loan
         If:

         13.5.1   any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to be
                  increased pursuant to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

         13.5.2   any Bank claims indemnification from the Obligors under
                  Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity), the Agent claims
                  indemnification from the Obligors under Clause 15.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) in respect of payment received by it and paid by
                  it to a Bank under the Finance Documents or any Bank claims
                  indemnification from the Principal Borrower under Clause
                  17.1 (Increased Costs); or

         13.5.3   any Bank gives notice to the Principal Borrower in
                  accordance with the provisions of Clause 15.5 (Bank
                  Notification),

         notice shall be irrevocable) of its intention to procure the
         repayment of such Bank's share of the Loan. On the last day of each
         then current Interest Period or Term, or at any other time subject to
         the provisions of Clause 28.4 (Break Costs), each Borrower to which
         an Advance has been made shall repay such Bank's portion of the
         Advance to which such Interest Period or Term relates. Any repayment
         of an Original Term Advance so made shall reduce pro tanto the
         Borrowers' repayment obligations under Clause 10 (Repayment of the
         Original Term Facility).

13.6     No Further Advances
         A Bank for whose account a repayment is to be made under Clause 13.5
         (Repayment of a Bank's Share of the Loan) shall not be obliged to
         participate in the making of Advances on or after the date upon which

         The Borrowers shall not repay all or any part of the Loan except at
         the times and in the manner expressly provided for in this Agreement.

13.8     No Reborrowing of the Original Term Facility
         None of the Borrowers shall be entitled to reborrow any amount of the
         Original Term Facility which has been repaid.

14.      MANDATORY PREPAYMENT

14.1     Mandatory Prepayment from Acquisition Recovery Proceeds
         The Principal Borrower and Shareholder shall ensure that Acquisition
         Recovery Proceeds received by the Shareholder or any member of the
         Restricted Group, above an aggregate minimum threshold of Acquisition
         Recovery Proceeds of CHF5,000,000 (the "Minimum Threshold"), are paid
         to the Agent and applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance with
         Clause 14.3 (Application of Proceeds) unless the Principal Borrower
         can show to the satisfaction of the Agent (acting reasonably) that:

                                     -40-

                  Recovery Proceeds received above the Minimum Threshold have
                  been, or will promptly upon receipt be, deposited in the
                  Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of Clause
                  14.2 (Payment of Acquisition Recovery Proceeds into Escrow
                  Account); and

         14.1.2   all Acquisition Recovery Proceeds falling within sub-clause
                  14.1.1 are to be applied towards an Acquisition Remedy
                  within a period of 365 days from the date of receipt of such
                  Acquisition Recovery Proceeds by the Shareholder or the
                  relevant member of the Restricted Group.

         Any Acquisition Recovery Proceeds received above the first
         CHF150,000,000 aggregate amount of Acquisition Recovery Proceeds
         shall be paid to the Agent and applied in repayment of the Loan in
         accordance with Clause 14.3 (Application of Proceeds).

14.2     Payment of Acquisition Recovery Proceeds into Escrow Account
         The Principal Borrower and Shareholder shall ensure that any

         Prepayment from Acquisition Recovery Proceeds) are deposited in the
         Escrow Account. The Shareholder or the relevant member of the
         Restricted Group that received the Acquisition Recovery Proceeds
         shall be entitled, during the aforementioned 365 day period, to
         withdraw sums from the Escrow Account only to the extent that it is
         reasonably able to demonstrate that such sums will be applied towards
         an Acquisition Remedy. Any sums not so withdrawn during such 365 day
         period shall thereafter be paid to the Agent and applied in repayment
         of the Loan in accordance with Clause 14.3 (Application of Proceeds).

14.3     Application of Proceeds
         14.3.1   Any amounts paid to the Agent in accordance with Clause 14.1
                  (Mandatory Prepayment from Acquisition Recovery Proceeds)
                  and Clause 14.2 (Payment of Acquisition Recovery Proceeds
                  into Escrow Account) shall be retained in the Escrow Account
                  for application on one or more Repayment Dates or the last
                  day of Interest Periods in respect of Original Term Advances
                  until such time as such amounts have been applied in full in
                  repayment of the Loan in accordance with this 14.3.

         14.3.2   Subject to sub-clause 14.3.3 below, any amounts paid to the
                  Agent in accordance with Clause 14.1 (Mandatory Prepayment
                  from Acquisition Recovery Proceeds) and Clause 14.2 (Payment
                  of Acquisition Recovery Proceeds into Escrow Account) shall,
                  on the dates indicated in sub-clause 14.3.1 above, be
                  applied as follows: (i) first, in prepayment of the Original
                  Term Loan (satisfying pro tanto the Borrowers' repayment
                  obligations under Clause 10 (Repayment of the Original Term
                  Facility)), (ii) secondly, in prepayment of the Revolving
                  Loan (and a corresponding cancellation of the Available
                  Revolving Facility), in an amount equal to the balance not
                  applied in accordance with (i) above and (iii) thirdly, if
                  any excess remains thereafter, in payment of such excess to
                  the relevant member of the Group and in cancellation of the
                  remaining Available Revolving Facility by an equal amount,
                  in each case in accordance with the provisions of Clause 13
                  (Cancellation and Prepayment).

                                     -41-
<page>

         14.3.3   If the application of such amounts received by the Agent
                  would at any time amount to an unlawful distribution by a
                  member of the Restricted Group to its shareholders and such
                  amounts cannot otherwise be lent by the member of the
                  Restricted Group entitled to such amounts to sufficient
                  Borrowers to allow the requirements of this Clause 14
                  (Mandatory Repayment) to be satisfied, then the Agent will
                  retain any monies which cannot be applied in accordance with
                  this Clause 14 in the Escrow Account until such time that
                  those monies can be so applied or all amounts outstanding
                  under the Finance Documents have been repaid in full.

14.4     Mandatory Prepayment due to Change in Control
         14.4.1   If any person, or group of persons acting in concert, which
                  does not at the date hereof have control of the Parent or,
                  of NTL Inc. acquires control of the Parent or of NTL Inc.:

                  (a)       the Principal Borrower shall give notice of that
                            event to the Agent promptly upon becoming aware
                            thereof;

                  (b)       if the Agent (acting on the instructions of an
                            Instructing Group) gives notice to such effect,
                            the Available Revolving Commitment (if any) of
                            each Bank shall immediately be cancelled and
                            reduced to zero; and

                  (c)       if the Agent (acting on the instructions of an
                            Instructing Group) gives notice to such effect,
                            the Loan shall become immediately due and payable
                            and shall be repaid by the relevant Borrowers
                            together with accrued interest and all other
                            amounts payable by the Borrowers under the Finance
                            Documents within seven days of the date of such
                            notice.

                  due to Change in Control):

                  "control" means:

                  (a)       the power (whether by way of ownership of shares,

                                    one-half of the maximum number of votes

         14.4.3   This Clause 14.4 (Mandatory Prepayment due to Change in
                  Control) will not apply, and the Available Revolving
                  Commitments will not be cancelled and the Loan will not
                  become due and payable, in the event that France Telecom
                  S.A. or any of its affiliates acquires control of either the
                  Parent or NTL Inc.

15.      TAXES

15.1     Tax Gross-up
         All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Bank under the Finance
         Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
         or on account of tax unless such Obligor is required to make such a
         payment subject to the deduction or withholding of tax, in which case
         the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of which such deduction
         or withholding is required to be made) shall, subject to Clause 25.10
         (Swiss Withholding Tax) and Clause 15.4 (Excluded Claims), be
         increased to the extent necessary to ensure that such Bank receives a
         sum net of any deduction or withholding equal to the sum which it
         would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made or
         required to be made.

15.2     Tax Indemnity
         Without prejudice to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up) but subject to Clause
         25.10 (Swiss Withholding Tax), if the Agent or (as a result of the
         introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
         administration or application of, any law or regulation or order or
         governmental rule or double taxation agreement or any published
         practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority after the
         date hereof) an Obligor or any Bank (a) is required to make any
         payment of or on account of tax on or in relation to any sum received
         or receivable under the Finance Documents (including any sum deemed
         for purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the Agent or such
         Bank whether or not actually received or receivable) or (b) has any
         liability in respect of any such payment asserted, imposed, levied or
         assessed against it, the Obligors (jointly and severally) shall,
         within five Business Days of demand by the Agent, promptly indemnify
         the Agent or Bank which suffers a loss or liability as a result
         against such payment or liability, together with any interest,
         penalties, costs and expenses payable or incurred in connection
         therewith, provided that this Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) shall not
         apply to:

         15.2.1   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                  income, profits or gains actually received or receivable by
                  the Agent or such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
                  including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received
                  or receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not actually
                  receivable) by the jurisdiction in which the Agent or such
                  Bank is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or
                  jurisdictions) in which the Agent or such Bank is treated as
                  resident for tax purposes; or

                                     -43-
<page>

         15.2.2   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                  income, profits or gains of the Facility Office of the Agent
                  or such Bank actually received or receivable by the Agent or
                  such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including
                  any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received or
                  receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not actually
                  receivable) by the jurisdiction in which its Facility Office
                  is located; or

         15.2.3   any tax imposed on a Bank which would not have arisen but
                  for a payment by such Bank, with reference to this Agreement
                  and in respect of sums received or receivable under the
                  Finance Documents.

15.3     Claims by Banks and the Agent
         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax
         Indemnity) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the
         claim, whereupon the Agent shall notify the Principal Borrower and
         the other Borrowers thereof. If the Agent intends to make a claim
         pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) it shall notify the Principal
         Borrower and the other Borrowers of the event giving rise to the
         claim.

15.4     Excluded Claims
         If any Bank is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no Obligor
         shall be liable to pay to that Bank under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up)
         any amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed in excess of the
         amount it would have been obliged to pay if that Bank had been or had
         not ceased to be a Qualifying Lender provided that this Clause 15.4
         shall not apply (and each Obligor shall be obliged to comply with its
         obligations under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

         15.4.1   after the date hereof, there shall have been any
                  introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
                  administration or application of, any law or regulation or
                  order or governmental rule or double taxation agreement or
                  any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing
                  authority and as a result thereof such Bank ceases to be a
                  Qualifying Lender; or

         15.4.2   such Bank is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender as a
                  result of the actions of or omission to act by any Obligor;
                  or

         15.4.3   the relevant Obligor would be required to make a deduction
                  or withholding in respect of tax irrespective of whether the
                  Bank is or is not a Qualifying Lender.

15.5     Bank Notification
         Each Bank (other than a Bank which became a Bank in accordance with
         sub-clause 35.7.2 of Clause 35.7 (Qualifying Lenders)) shall, as soon
         as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that it will cease to
         be a Qualifying Lender, other than in the circumstances contemplated
         by sub-clauses 15.4.1 or 15.4.2 of Clause 15.4 (Excluded Claims) or
         if the circumstances contemplated by sub-clause 15.4.3 of Clause 15.4
         (Excluded Claims) apply, notify the Principal Borrower thereof. If a
         Bank gives notice in accordance with this Clause 15.5 (Bank
         Notification) and at any time thereafter while the relevant
         circumstances are continuing the Principal Borrower notifies it (in
         writing) that it has identified a financial institution acceptable to
         it and willing to participate in the Facilities, then such Bank shall
         (as requested in such notice) transfer all of its rights, benefits
         and obligations under the Finance Documents to such financial
         institution

                                     -44-
<page>

         provided that, save in the case of a Bank which will cease to be a
         Qualifying Lender as a result of a decision by such Bank or any
         holding company thereof (or any deliberate omission which has the
         same consequence) to cease to carry on the business it carries on and
         in respect of which it is a Qualifying Lender, the Principal Borrower
         shall reimburse such Bank for all reasonable costs and expenses
         incurred in connection with such transfer (including any costs
         payable under Clause 28.4 (Break Costs)), other than any minor costs
         and expenses of an administrative nature.

16.      TAX RECEIPTS

16.1     Notification of Requirement to Deduct Tax
         If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction
         or withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents
         (or if thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the
         manner in which such deductions or withholdings are calculated), the
         Principal Borrower and the Bank to which such sum is payable shall
         promptly upon becoming aware of such a requirement notify the Agent
         accordingly. If the Agent receives such a notification from a Bank it
         shall notify the Principal Borrower and the relevant Obligor.

16.2     Evidence of Payment of Tax
         If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in
         respect of which it is required to make any deduction or withholding,
         it shall pay the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to
         the relevant taxation or other authority within the time allowed for
         such payment under applicable law and shall request and, within
         thirty days of it receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each
         Bank an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued by such
         authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so
         required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that Bank's share
         of such payment.

16.3     Tax Credit Payment
         If an additional payment is made under Clause 15 (Taxes) by an
         Obligor for the benefit of the Agent or any Bank and the Agent or
         such Bank, in its sole discretion, determines that it has obtained
         (and has derived full use and benefit from) a credit against, a
         relief or remission for, or repayment of, any tax, then, if and to
         the extent that the Agent or such Bank, in its sole opinion,
         determines that:

         16.3.1   such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect
                  of, calculated with reference to or otherwise relates to the
                  additional payment made pursuant to Clause 15 (Taxes); and

         16.3.2   its tax affairs for its tax year in respect of which such
                  credit, relief, remission or repayment was obtained have
                  been finally settled,

         the Agent or such Bank shall, to the extent that it can do so without
         prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,
         remission or repayment, pay to such Obligor such amount as the Agent
         or such Bank shall, in its sole opinion, determine to be the amount
         which will leave the Agent or such Bank (after such payment) in no
         worse after-tax position than it would have been in had the
         additional payment in question not been required to be made by such
         Obligor.

                                     -45-
<page>

16.4     Tax Credit Clawback
         If the Agent or any Bank makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to
         Clause 16.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and the Agent or such Bank
         subsequently determines in its sole opinion that the credit, relief,
         remission or repayment in respect of which such payment was made was
         not available or has been withdrawn or that it was unable to use such
         credit, relief, remission or repayment in full, such Obligor shall
         reimburse the Agent or such Bank such amount as the Agent or such
         Bank determines in its sole opinion is necessary to place it in the
         same after-tax position as it would have been in if such credit,
         relief, remission or repayment had been obtained and fully used and
         retained by the Agent or such Bank.

16.5     Tax and Other Affairs
         No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
         Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever
         manner it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit,
         relief, remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause
         15 (Taxes) in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or
         repayment available to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose
         any information relating to its tax or other affairs or any
         computations in respect thereof.

17.      INCREASED COSTS

17.1     Increased Costs
         If, by reason of the occurrence, in each case after the date on which
         this Agreement was originally entered into, of (a) any change in law
         or in its interpretation or administration and/or (b) compliance with
         any such new law or with any request or requirement relating to the
         maintenance of capital or any other request from or requirement of
         any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (in
         each case, where a request or requirement that does not have the
         force of law is a request or requirement with which financial
         institutions subject to such request or requirement are generally
         accustomed to comply):

         17.1.1   a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to
                  obtain the rate of return on its capital which it would have
                  been able to obtain but for such Bank's entering into or
                  assuming or maintaining a commitment or performing its
                  obligations under the Finance Documents;

         17.1.2   a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as
                  a result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or
                  maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations under
                  the Finance Documents; or

         17.1.3   there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
                  company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's
                  share of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

         then the Principal Borrower shall, within three Business Days of a
         demand of the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of that Bank
         amounts sufficient to indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to
         indemnify its holding company from and against, as the case may be,
         (i) such reduction in the rate of return on capital, (ii) such cost
         or (iii) such increased cost.

                                     -46-
<page>

17.2     Increased Costs Claims
         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 17.1 (Increased
         Costs) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to such claim,
         whereupon the Agent shall notify the Principal Borrower thereof.

17.3     Exclusions
         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 17 (Increased
         Costs), no Bank shall be entitled to make any claim under this Clause
         17 (Increased Costs) in respect of any reduction in the rate of
         return on its capital, cost, increased cost or liability:

         17.3.1   attributable to a deduction or withholding for or on account
                  of tax from a payment under a Finance Document required by
                  law to be made by an Obligor and compensated for pursuant to
                  the provisions of Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but
                  was not so compensated solely because of Clause 15.4
                  (Excluded Claims) or Clause 25.10 (Swiss Withholding Tax));

         17.3.2   compensated by Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) but
                  was not so compensated solely because of one of the
                  exclusions set out in sub-clauses 15.2.1 to 15.2.3 of Clause
                  15.2 (Tax Indemnity) or Clause 25.10 (Swiss Withholding
                  Tax));

         17.3.3   compensated by the Mandatory Cost Rate; or

         17.3.4   attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance
                  Party or its affiliates of any law or regulation.

18.      ILLEGALITY

         If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make,
         fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the
         Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the
         same, deliver to the Principal Borrower through the Agent a notice to
         that effect and:

         18.1.1   such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in
                  the making of any Advances and the amount of its Available
                  Revolving Commitment (if any) shall be immediately reduced
                  to zero;

         18.1.2   if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, each
                  Borrower which has drawn an Advance shall on the last day of
                  the current Interest Period or, as the case may be, Term of
                  each Advance or, if earlier, on the date specified by such
                  Bank (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable
                  grace period permitted by law) repay such Bank's share of
                  any outstanding Advances together with accrued interest
                  thereon and all other amounts owing to such Bank under the
                  Finance Documents; and

         18.1.3   any repayment of Original Term Advances so made shall reduce
                  pro tanto the Borrowers' repayment obligations under Clause
                  10 (Repayment of the Original Term Facility).

                                     -47-
<page>

19.      MITIGATION

         If any Bank gives notice to the Principal Borrower under Clause 15.5
         (Bank Notification) or if, in respect of any Bank, circumstances
         arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in:

         19.1.1   an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account
                  pursuant to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up);

         19.1.2   a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) or Clause 17.1 (Increased Costs); or

         19.1.3   the reduction of its Available Revolving Commitment to zero
                  or any repayment being required to be made pursuant to
                  Clause 18 (Illegality),

         then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying
         the rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors under any
         of the Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall (in the case of the
         circumstances referred to in sub-clauses 19.1.1, 19.1.2 and 19.1.3)
         promptly upon becoming aware of such circumstances notify the Agent
         thereof and, in all cases (but without prejudice to the obligations
         of such Bank under Clause 15.5 (Bank Notification)), in consultation
         with the Agent and the Principal Borrower and to the extent that it
         can do so lawfully, take reasonable steps (including a change of
         location of its Facility Office or the transfer of its rights,
         benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents to another
         financial institution acceptable to the Principal Borrower and
         willing to participate in the Facility) to mitigate the effects of
         such circumstances, provided that such Bank shall be under no
         obligation to take any such action if, in the opinion of such Bank,
         to do so might have any adverse effect upon its business, operations
         or financial condition (other than any minor costs and expenses of an
         administrative nature).

                            Statements of such Obligor,

                  in which case any reference in this Agreement to those

                  those financial statements as adjusted to reflect the basis
                  upon which the Original Financial Statements were prepared;
                  or

         21.12.2  the Principal Borrower also notifies the Agent that it is no
                  longer practicable to test compliance with the financial

                  against the financial statements received in which case:

                  (b)       if, after one month commencing on the date of the
                            notice given to the Agent pursuant to this
                            sub-clause 21.12.2, the Agent and the Principal
                            Borrower cannot agree alternative financial
                            conditions which are acceptable to an Instructing
                            Group, the Agent shall refer the matter to such
                            internationally recognised accounting firm as may
                            be agreed between the Principal Borrower and an
                            Instructing Group for determination of the
                            adjustments required to be made to such financial
                            statements or the calculation of such ratios to
                            take account of such change, such determination to
                            be binding on the parties hereto, provided that
                            pending such determination the Principal Borrower
                            shall continue to prepare financial statements and
                            calculate such ratios in accordance with

         Each Obligor (other than the Shareholder) shall, and the Principal
         Borrower shall procure that each member of the Restricted Group

                  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Licences
                  in all material respects and no Obligor shall, and the
                  Principal Borrower shall procure that no member of the
                  Restricted Group shall knowingly, do, omit to do or suffer
                  to be done, any act whereby any person is entitled or
                  empowered to revoke, materially and adversely amend,
                  suspend, withdraw or terminate any Licence (except in each
                  case where the failure to comply with this sub-clause 23.8.1
                  could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                  Effect); and

         23.8.2   save in order to effect the Reorganisation or an Additional
                  Merger, continue to carry on the business that it carries on
                  at the date hereof and not enter into any type of business
                  (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a business which

                  cable and/or television and/or telephone network or system
                  or the provision of such services) which would result in a
                  material change in the business of the Restricted Group
                  taken as a whole from the business of the Restricted Group
                  as at the date hereof.

                  take all action necessary to ensure the continued validity
                  and enforceability of its rights thereunder;

         23.9.2   not amend, vary, novate or supplement any such Material
                  Commercial Contract in any material respect; and

         23.9.3   not terminate any such Material Commercial Contract prior to
                  its contractual termination date,

         if such non-compliance, failure to take action, amendment, variation,

         material in the conduct of its business as conducted at the date
         hereof in good working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear
         excepted) and shall maintain in all material respects all books and
         records which are necessary in connection therewith or in connection
         with the conduct of its business.

                  Permitted Facilities Provider's rights under and preserving

                  its material assets in favour of the Permitted Facilities

         For the purposes of this Clause 23.23 the aggregate EBITDA of the
         Guarantors and the consolidated EBITDA of the Restricted Group at any

         Restricted Group for the immediately preceding four complete
         Financial Quarters.

         A breach of this Clause 23.23 shall not constitute an Event of

         23.25.2  pay, prepay or repay or defease, exchange or repurchase any
                  amount under the Subordinated NTL CV1 Debt or any other

         between the Principal Borrower and the Agent (both acting
         reasonably), for a minimum period of 4

                                     -71-

         entered into provided that the Principal Borrower shall not be
         required to enter into a Hedging Agreement in respect of any Advance
         if, on the date falling 180 days after the date of such Advance, at
         least 40 per cent. of the Loan is already so capped and provided
         further that the obligations set out in this Clause 23.26 shall cease
         to apply on the Restatement Amendment Effective Date.

                  directly or indirectly) in the Restricted Group; and

         (ii)     any proposed purchase of, or investment (whether directly or
                  indirectly) in the Restricted Group, which is approved by an

         respect of the overindebtedness of the Overindebted Subsidiaries, as

         where any consent of an Instructing Group or the Banks in connection
         with such other solution is required as soon as reasonably
         practicable following the giving of such consent, provided that such
         consent is requested as soon as reasonably practicable).

         to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when
         made or deemed to be made and the circumstances giving rise to such
         inaccuracy, if capable of remedy or change, are not remedied or do

         24.15.1  the Parent, NTL SPV Inc., NTL CV1 or any Obligor repudiates
                  a Finance Document; or

         24.15.2  the security intended to be created by, or the subordination
                  effected under, the Finance Documents is not or ceases to be
                  legal and valid and (except as contemplated by the
                  Reservations or, if capable of remedy, such as is remedied
                  within five Business Days of the earlier of (a) notice of
                  the relevant event by the Agent to the Parent and the
                  Principal Borrower and (b) the date on which the Parent, the
                  Principal Borrower or the relevant Obligor becomes aware of
                  such event) binding and enforceable.

24.16    Illegality
         At any time it is or becomes unlawful for the Parent or an Obligor to
         perform or comply with any or all of its obligations under the
         Finance Documents to which it is a party or any of the obligations of
         the Parent or an Obligor under the Finance Documents to which it is a
         party are not or cease to be legal and valid and (except as
         contemplated by the Reservations or, if capable of remedy, such as is
         remedied within five Business Days of the earlier of (a) notice of
         the relevant event by the Agent to the Parent or, as the case may be,
         the relevant Obligor and (b) the date on which the Parent or, as the
         case may be, the relevant Obligor becomes aware of such event)
         binding and enforceable.

24.17    Adverse Proceedings
         If any investigation or proceedings are commenced by, any government,
         court or regulatory agency or authority, which could reasonably be
         expected to be adversely determined, and if so determined, are
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

24.18    Subordinated Funding
         Any person (other than a Finance Party or an Obligor) party to the
         Subordination Deed, the Second Subordination Deed or any other

         Funding fails to comply with its obligations under the Subordination
         Deed, the Second Subordination Deed or such other agreement or deed
         and (unless an Obligor party to the Subordination Deed, the Second
         Subordination Deed or any such other agreement or deed has also so
         failed to comply) such failure might reasonably be expected to have a
         material adverse effect on the subordination intended to be effected
         by the Subordination Deed, the Second Subordination Deed or such
         other agreement or deed.

         24.20.1  declare all or any part of the Advances to be immediately

                  then owed by the Borrowers under the Finance Documents) or

         24.20.2  declare that any undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility

         24.21.1  require repayment of all or such part of the Advances on
                  such date as it may specify in such notice (whereupon the

                  together with accrued interest thereon and any other sums
                  then owed by the Borrowers under the Finance Documents) or
                  withdraw its declaration with effect from such date as it
                  may specify; and/or

         24.21.2  select as the duration of any Interest Period or Term which

                  other person, the amount of such loss being the amount which

         obligations under the Finance Documents.

25.3     Continuing Obligations
         The obligations of each Guarantor herein contained shall constitute

                  the Finance Documents; or

         25.4.7   any other act, event or omission which, but for this Clause
                  25.4, might operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect

                  any of the rights, powers or remedies conferred upon any of
                  the Finance Parties by the Finance Documents or by law.

25.5     Settlement Conditional

         Obligor being avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to
         bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar laws of general
         application and, if any such security or payment is so avoided or
         reduced, each Finance Party shall be entitled to recover the value or
         amount of such security or payment from such Guarantor subsequently
         as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.

25.6     Exercise of Rights

         Guarantor by the Finance Documents or by law:

         25.6.1   to make any demand of any Obligor (save where such demand is

         Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of
         performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents:

         25.7.1   to be indemnified by a Borrower;

         25.7.2   to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of the

                  and/or

         25.7.3   to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way
                  of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance
                  Parties under the Finance Documents or

         of the Share Pledges has been enforced.

25.8     Appropriations
         Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Borrowers

         on its behalf) may:

         25.8.1   refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys,
                  security or rights held or received by that Finance Party
                  (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those
                  amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and
                  order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or
                  otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit
                  of the same; and

         25.8.2   hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys
                  received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's
                  liability under this Clause 25.

         the Principal Borrower shall pay to the Agent within three Business
         Days of demand for account of such Bank an amount equal to the amount
         (if any) by which (a) the additional interest which would have been
         payable on the amount so received or recovered had it been received
         or recovered on the last day of that Interest Period or Term exceeds
         (b) the amount of interest which that Bank would have been able to
         obtain by placing an amount equal to the amount so received or
         recovered on deposit with a prime bank in London for a period
         starting on the Business Day following the date of such receipt or

         Where a sum is to be paid hereunder to the Agent for account of

         available to that other person until it has been able to establish to
         its satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but if it
         does so and it proves to be the case that it had not actually
         received such sum, then the person to whom such sum was so made
         available shall on request refund the same to the Agent together with
         an amount sufficient to indemnify the Agent against any cost or loss
         it may have suffered or incurred by reason of its having paid out

         31.6.1   to the extent such sums are not denominated in Swiss Francs,
                  they will be converted by the Agent into the equivalent
                  amount of Swiss Francs; and

         31.6.2   the net Security Proceeds will then be credited to such
                  account or accounts as the Agent thinks fit pending their
                  application in accordance with Clause 31.7 (Application of
                  Security Proceeds), the Agent being entitled to retain the
                  net Security Proceeds in such account or accounts whilst any
                  Obligor remains under any actual or contingent obligations
                  under the Finance Documents and/or any member of the Group
                  remains under any actual or contingent obligations under or
                  in respect of the Secured Permitted Facilities.

31.7     Application of Security Proceeds
         Amounts standing to the credit of the account or accounts referred to
         in Clause 31.6 (Security Proceeds) shall (save to the extent
         prohibited by any applicable law) be applied by the Agent in the
         following order of priority:

         31.7.1   first, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs and
                  expenses of the Agent;

         31.7.2   secondly, in or towards discharging all assessments to tax
                  made on the Agent (or, as the case may be, any other
                  Security Party) in respect of any of the Security held by it
                  or its receipt of the Security Proceeds;

         31.7.3   thirdly, after setting aside any sums which the Agent
                  believes will or may become payable under either sub-clause
                  31.7.1 or sub-clause 31.7.2 above, in or towards satisfying
                  the Principal Borrower's obligations to the Banks under
                  sub-clause 29.1.2 of Clause 29.1 (Borrowers' Indemnities);

         31.7.4   fourthly, to the Finance Parties and the Permitted
                  Facilities Provider in or towards the discharge, pro rata,
                  of all sums due and payable by the Parent or the Obligors
                  under the Finance Documents or, as the case may be, by any
                  members of the Group under or in respect of the Secured
                  Permitted Facilities;

                                     -89-
<page>

         31.7.5   fifthly, if no Obligor has any further actual or contingent
                  liability under the Finance Documents and no member of the
                  Group has any further actual or contingent liability under
                  the documentation relating to the Secured Permitted
                  Facilities, in payment to the extent necessary to any person
                  the Agent is obliged to pay in priority to the member of the
                  Group otherwise entitled to such sum; and

         31.7.6   thereafter, in payment to the member of the Group entitled
                  to such sum.

         The Permitted Facilities Provider shall, for the purposes of enabling
         the Agent to determine the amounts to be applied in accordance with
         the provisions of Clause 31.7.4 and Clause 31.7.5, promptly after the
         Agent declares all or any part of the Advances to be immediately due
         and payable in accordance with either Clause 24.20 (Acceleration and
         Cancellation) or Clause 24.21 (Advances Due on Demand), notify the
         Agent of the amounts due and payable to it under or in respect of the
         Secured Permitted Facilities (identifying, in such notification, the
         nature of each such amount payable and whether it is in respect of
         principal, interest or some other obligation).

31.8     Partial Payments
         31.8.1   If and whenever a payment is made by an Obligor hereunder
                  and the Agent receives an amount less than the due amount of
                  such payment, the Agent may apply the amount received
                  towards the obligations of the Obligors under the Finance
                  Documents in the following order:

                  (a)       first, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs
                            and expenses of the Agent;

                  (b)       secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any
                            accrued interest or commitment commission due but
                            unpaid;

                  (c)       thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any
                            principal due but unpaid; and

                  (d)       fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any
                            other sum due but unpaid.

31.9     Variation of Partial Payments
         The order of partial payments set out in Clause 31.8 (Partial
         Payments) shall, in the case of the payment made by any member of the
         Group, override any appropriation made by the member of the Group to
         which the partial payment relates but the order set out in
         sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) of Clause 30.8 (Partial Payments) may be
         varied if agreed by all the Banks.

31.10    Business Days

         31.10.1  Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a
                  Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the
                  same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding
                  Business Day (if there is not).

         31.10.2  During any extension of the due date for payment of any
                  principal or an Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is
                  payable on the principal at the rate payable on the original
                  due date.

32.      SET-OFF

32.1     Contractual Set-off
         Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and
         payable hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to
         which such Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with
         such Bank in satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such
         Obligor to such Bank under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this
         purpose, each Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing
         to the credit of any such account such other currencies as may be
         necessary to effect such application.

32.2     Set-off not Mandatory
         No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause
         32.1 (Contractual Set-off).

33.      SHARING

33.1     Payments to Banks
         If (a) prior to the Agent declaring all or any part of the Advances
         to be immediately due and payable in accordance with either
         sub-clause 14.4.1(b) of Clause 14.4 (Mandatory Prepayment due to
         Change in Control), Clause 24.20 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or
         Clause 24.21 (Advances Due on Demand), a Bank (a "Recovering Bank")
         applies any receipt or recovery from an Obligor to a payment due and
         payable under this Agreement and such amount is received or recovered
         other than in accordance with Clause 31.3 (Payments by the Agent), or
         (b) after the Agent declaring all or any part of the Advances to be
         immediately due and payable in accordance with either sub-clause
         14.4.1(b) of Clause 14.4 (Mandatory Prepayment due to Change in
         Control), Clause 24.20 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or Clause
         24.21 (Advances Due on Demand), a Bank or the Permitted Facilities
         Provider (a "Recovering Entity") applies any receipt or recovery from
         a member of the Group to a payment due and payable under this
         Agreement and/or the documentation relating to the Secured Permitted
         Facilities and such amount is received or recovered other than in
         accordance with Clause 31.7 (Application of Security Proceeds) or
         Clause 31.8 (Partial Payments), then such Recovering Bank or, as the
         case may be, such Recovering Entity shall:

         33.1.1   notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

         33.1.2   at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an
                  amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be
                  retained by such Recovering Bank or, as the case may be,
                  such Recovering Entity as its share of any payment to be
                  made in accordance with Clause 31.8 (Partial Payments).

33.2     Redistribution of Payments
         The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by
         the relevant member of the Group and distribute it between the
         Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Bank) or, as the case may
         be, between the Security Parties (other than the Recovering Entity)
         in accordance with Clause 31.8 (Partial Payments).

33.3     Recovering Bank's Rights
         The Recovering Bank or, as the case may be, the Recovering Entity
         will be subrogated into the rights of the parties which have shared
         in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 33.2

                                     -91-
<page>

         (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and
         the relevant Obligor (or, in the case of any member of the Group
         which is not an Obligor, the Principal Borrower shall procure that
         such member of the Group) shall be liable to the Recovering Bank or,
         as the case may be, the Recovering Entity in an amount equal to the
         Sharing Payment).

33.4     Repayable Recoveries
         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Bank or, as the case may be, the Recovering Entity becomes
         repayable and is repaid by such Recovering Bank or, as the case may
         be, by such Recovering Entity, then:

         33.4.1   each party which has received a share of such Sharing
                  Payment pursuant to Clause 33.2 (Redistribution of Payments)
                  shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for
                  account of such Recovering Bank or, as the case may be, such
                  Recovering Entity an amount equal to its share of such
                  Sharing Payment; and

         33.4.2   such Recovering Bank's or, as the case may be, such
                  Recovering Entity's rights of subrogation in respect of any
                  reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant member of
                  the Group will be liable to the reimbursing party for the
                  amount so reimbursed.

33.5     Exception
         This Clause 33 shall not apply if the Recovering Bank or, as the case
         may be, the Recovering Entity would not, after making any payment
         pursuant hereto, have a valid and enforceable claim against the
         relevant member of the Group.

33.6     Recoveries Through Legal Proceedings
         If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
         prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall
         commence any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and,
         as a result thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount,
         then such Bank shall not be required to share any portion of such
         amount with any Bank which has the legal right to, but does not, join
         in such action or commence and diligently prosecute a separate action
         to enforce its rights in another court.

33.7     Hedging Agreements
         The Principal Borrower shall provide the Agent with, as soon as is
         reasonably practicable after the same are entered into, copies of the
         Hedging Agreements entered into by either it or any other Borrowers
         selected by it pursuant to Clause 22.26 (Hedging). The Principal
         Borrower and each Hedging Bank shall ensure that each Hedging
         Agreement to which (a) (in the case of the Principal Borrower) it or
         any other member of the Group is a party or (b) (in the case of a
         Hedging Bank) it or any of its affiliates is a party as a Hedge
         Counterparty:

         33.7.1   provides for "two-way payments" in the event of a
                  termination of a hedging transaction entered into pursuant
                  to a Hedging Agreement whether upon a termination event or
                  an event of default (each as defined in the Hedging
                  Agreement), meaning that the defaulting party under that
                  Hedging Agreement will be entitled to receive payment under
                  the relevant termination provisions if

                                     -92-
<page>

                  the net replacement value of all terminated transactions
                  affected under the Hedging Agreement is in its favour;

         33.7.2   includes as an event of default (as defined in the Hedging
                  Agreement) an Event of Default.

33.8     Termination of Hedging Agreements
         Each Hedging Bank shall:

         33.8.1   if (a) any hedging transaction under any Hedging Agreement
                  to which it (or, as the case may be, its affiliate) is a
                  party is terminated, (b) a settlement amount or other amount
                  falls due from it (or, as the case may be, its affiliate) to
                  any Obligor under such a Hedging Agreement and (c) the
                  Security has become, and remains at the proposed date of
                  payment, enforceable, pay (or procure that its affiliate
                  pays) such a settlement amount to the Agent as Security
                  Proceeds for application in accordance with Clause 31.7
                  (Application of Security Proceeds); and

         33.8.2   unless the Agent otherwise instructs it, exercise (or
                  procure that its affiliate exercises) any rights it may have
                  to terminate the hedging transactions under the Hedging
                  Agreements to which either it or its affiliate is a party as
                  soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which
                  the Agent declares all or any part of the Advances to be
                  immediately due and payable in accordance with either Clause
                  24.20 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or Clause 24.21
                  (Advances Due on Demand).

33.9     Rights of Hedge Counterparties
         Whilst any Obligor has any actual or contingent liabilities under the
         Finance Documents, except with the prior consent of the Agent (acting
         on the instructions of an Instructing Group), no Hedging Bank will
         (and each Hedging Bank will procure that any of its affiliates who
         are Hedge Counterparties do not):

         33.9.1   demand or receive payment, prepayment, repayment, or any
                  distribution in respect of or on account of any of the
                  Hedging Liabilities in cash or in kind or apply any money or
                  property in or towards the discharge of any Hedging
                  Liabilities except for:

                  (a)       scheduled payments arising under the terms of the
                            Hedging Agreements; and

                  (b)       the proceeds of enforcement of the Security
                            Documents received and applied in the order
                            permitted by Clause 31.7 (Application of Security
                            Proceeds);

         33.9.2   exercise any right it might otherwise have pursuant to any
                  Hedging Agreement to terminate any hedging transactions
                  under such Hedging Agreement or to refuse to make any
                  payment due from it under such hedging transactions until
                  the Agent declares all or any part of the Advances to be
                  immediately due and payable in accordance with either Clause
                  24.20 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or Clause 24.21
                  (Advances Due on Demand);

                                     -93-

         33.9.3   discharge all or any part of the Hedging Liabilities by
                  set-off, any right of combination of accounts or otherwise
                  except if and to the extent that those Hedging Liabilities
                  are permitted to be paid under sub-clause 33.9.1(a); or

         33.9.4   take, accept or receive the benefit of any Encumbrance or
                  guarantee in respect of the Hedging Liabilities other than
                  under (a) the Finance Documents or (b) any other Encumbrance
                  or guarantee granted for the full benefit of the Finance
                  Parties in accordance with the ranking specified in this
                  Agreement.

33.10    Amendment of Hedging Agreements
         Except with the prior written consent of the Agent (acting on the
         instructions of an Instructing Group), neither an Obligor nor a
         Hedging Bank will (and each Hedging Bank which has an affiliate who
         is a Hedge Counterparty will procure that such affiliate does not)
         amend, vary, supplement or allow to be superseded any provision of
         the Hedging Agreements which would result in:

         33.10.1  any provision in the Hedging Agreements being amended unless
                  the Hedge Counterparty concerned, acting reasonably and in
                  good faith, certifies to the Agent that it considers such
                  amendment does not impose restrictions or obligations or
                  conditions on any Obligor which are more onerous than those
                  originally provided for in the Hedging Agreements;

         33.10.2  any payment under the Hedging Agreements being required to
                  be made by a Obligor earlier than the date originally
                  provided for in the Hedging Agreements; or

         33.10.3  any Obligor becoming liable to make an additional payment
                  (or increase an existing payment) under any of the Hedging
                  Agreements, where such liability does not arise from the
                  original provisions of the Hedging Agreements.

34.1     Appointment of the Agent
         Each of the Arrangers, the Banks and, for the purposes of (a) Clause

         34.2.1   assume, unless it has, in its capacity as agent for the
                  Banks, received notice to the contrary from any other party
                  hereto, that (a) any representation made or deemed to be
                  made by the Parent or an Obligor in connection with the
                  Finance

                  Banks or any other person or group of persons has not been
                  exercised;

         34.2.2   assume that (a) the Facility Office of each Bank is that

                  (Notices), Clause 34.15 (Banks' Mandatory Cost Details) and
                  Schedule 10 (Mandatory Costs), and the information provided
                  by the Permitted Facilities Provider pursuant to Clause 41
                  (Notices), is true and correct in all respects until it has
                  received from such Bank or, as the case may be, the
                  Permitted Facilities Provider notice of a change to the
                  Facility Office or any such information and act upon any
                  such notice until the same is superseded by a further
                  notice;

         34.2.3   engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
                  accountants, surveyors or other experts whose advice or
                  services may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable
                  and rely upon any advice so obtained;

         34.2.4   rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
                  expected to be within the knowledge of the Parent or an

                  Parent or such Obligor;

         34.2.5   rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
                  genuine;

         34.2.6   refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
                  vested in it as agent under the Finance Documents unless and
                  until instructed by an Instructing Group as to whether or
                  not such right, power or discretion is to be exercised and,
                  if it is to be exercised, as to the manner in which it
                  should be exercised;

         34.2.7   refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of
                  an Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding
                  arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
                  until it shall have received such security as it may require
                  (whether by way of payment in advance or otherwise) for all
                  costs, claims, losses, expenses (including legal fees) and
                  liabilities together with any VAT thereon which it will or
                  may expend or incur in complying with such instructions; and

         34.2.8   assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that
                  any notice or request made by the Principal Borrower is made
                  on behalf of all the Obligors.

34.3     Agent's Obligations

         34.3.2   promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
                  Default or any default by the Parent or an Obligor in the

                  behalf of that Bank in any legal or arbitration proceedings
                  relating to any Finance Document.

         The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical
         and administrative in nature.

34.4     Excluded Obligations
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
         neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall:

         34.4.1   be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any
                  representation made or deemed to be made by either the

                  such information is confidential or (b) such disclosure

                  provision is made herein; or

34.5     Delegation
         The Agent may delegate, transfer or assign to any subsidiary of J.P.
         Morgan Chase & Co. or its successor from time to time all or any of
         the rights, powers, authorities and discretions vested in it under
         the Finance Documents and the performance of its duties in accordance
         therewith, and such delegation, transfer or assignment may be made
         upon such terms and subject to such conditions (including the power
         to sub-delegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may
         think fit (and the term "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall
         include any such delegate).

34.6     Indemnification
         Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by
         the Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims,
         losses, expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with
         any VAT thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason
         of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its
         capacity as agent under the Finance Documents (other than any which
         have been reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to Clause 29.1
         (Borrowers' Indemnity)).

34.7     Exclusion of Liabilities
         Each Bank confirms that it has read the Notice to Recipients in the
         Information Memorandum, that it has complied with the Recipients'
         Obligations (as set out in the Notice to Recipients) and,
         accordingly, that it enters into this Agreement on the basis of the
         Notice to Recipients. In particular, each of the Banks accepts that
         it is entering into this Agreement in reliance only on the
         representations of the Parent and Obligors in this Agreement (and, in
         relation to the Information Memorandum, in reliance only on the
         representations of the Shareholder in Clause 20.22 (Information
         Memorandum)) and on its own investigations, that it has not relied on
         the Arrangers and that, except as set out below, it neither has nor
         will have any claims against the Arrangers arising from or in
         connection with this Agreement. Similarly, each of the Banks accepts
         that the Notice to Recipients in the Information Memorandum is
         applicable also to the Agent as if the Agent had been named in
         addition to the Arrangers in the Important Notice.

         Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
         Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the Banks
         and/or to the Permitted Facilities Provider:

         34.7.1   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, by the Parent or an Obligor or
                  by any other person in connection with the Finance Documents
                  or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered
                  into, made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents;

         34.7.2   for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents; or

         34.7.3   for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any
                  judgement, discretion or power given to any of them by or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents or any

                                     -97-
<page>

                  other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made
                  or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, neither the Agent nor the Arrangers shall be under any
         liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect of such
         matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

34.8     No Actions
         Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
         against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the
         Arrangers any claim it might have against any of them in respect of
         the matters referred to in Clause 34.7 (Exclusion of Liabilities).

34.9     Business with the Group
         The Agent and the Arrangers may accept deposits from, lend money to
         and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
         any member of the NTL Inc. Group, the NTL Inc. Holding Group or any
         member of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a conflict
         with the interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent or the
         Arrangers may undertake business with or for others even though it
         may lead to a conflict with the interests of any of the Banks.

34.10    Resignation
         The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
         assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days'
         prior notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto,
         provided that no such resignation shall be effective until a
         successor for the Agent is appointed in accordance with the
         succeeding provisions of this Clause 34.

34.11    Removal of Agent
         An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Principal
         Borrower, remove the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance
         Documents by giving notice to that effect to each of the other
         parties hereto. Such removal shall take effect only when a successor
         to the Agent is appointed in accordance with the terms of the Finance
         Documents.

34.12    Successor Agent
         If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 34.10
         (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 34.11 (Removal of
         Agent), then any reputable and experienced bank or other financial
         institution may, with the prior consent of the Principal Borrower, be
         appointed as a successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group during
         the period of such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed,
         the Agent may appoint such a successor itself.

34.13    Rights and Obligations
         If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of
         Clause 34.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing
         Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation under the
         Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the
         provisions of this Clause 34 and (b) its successor and each of the
         other parties to the Finance Documents shall have the same rights and
         obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such
         successor had been a party thereto.

                                     -98-

34.14    Own Responsibility
         It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has
         itself been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making
         its own independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks
         arising under or in connection with the Finance Documents including,
         but not limited to:

         34.14.1  the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition,
                  affairs, status and nature of each member of the NTL Inc.
                  Group, the NTL Inc. Holding Group and the Group;

         34.14.2  the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents and any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents;

         34.14.3  whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                  that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any
                  of their respective assets under or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents; and

         34.14.4  the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum and any other information provided by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, the Parent, an Obligor, or by
                  any other person in connection with the Finance Documents,
                  the transactions contemplated therein or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers
         that it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent
         and the Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

34.15    Banks' Mandatory Cost Details
         Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such
         detail as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory
         Cost Rate in accordance with Schedule 10 (Mandatory Costs).

34.16    Receipt of Information by the Agent
         Any information or document received by the Agent shall only be
         treated as having been received by the Agent if the same has been
         delivered to the Agent's agency department in accordance with Clause
         41 (Notices). Accordingly, any information or documents received by
         the Agent other than by its agency department in accordance with
         Clause 41 (Notices) is not by reason of that receipt to be treated as
         having been received by the Agent unless and until the Agent's agency
         department has received actual notice of the same in accordance with
         such Clause. Save as expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless
         the Agent's agency department shall have received information or
         documents in accordance with Clause 41 (Notices) the Agent shall have
         no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
         disclose, any information or documents, that are communicated to or
         obtained by the Agent.

35.      ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS

35.1     Binding Agreement

         of each party hereto and its or any subsequent successors and
         Transferees.

35.2     No Assignments and Transfers by the Parent or the Obligors
         Neither the Parent nor any Obligor shall be entitled to assign or

         Finance Documents.

35.3     Assignment and Transfers by Banks
         35.3.1   Subject to Clause 35.7 (Qualifying Lenders), any Bank may,
                  at any time, assign all or any of its rights and benefits
                  hereunder, transfer in accordance with Clause 35.5
                  (Transfers by Banks) all or any of its rights, benefits and
                  obligations hereunder to, or enter into any form of
                  sub-participation agreement with, a bank or financial
                  institution.

         35.3.2   The prior written consent of the Principal Borrower (which
                  shall be deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf
                  of the other Obligors) is required for an assignment or
                  transfer by a Bank unless the assignment or transfer is to:

                  (a)       another Bank; or

                  (b)       an affiliate of the transferring Bank.

         35.3.3   The Principal Borrower's consent must not be (a)
                  unreasonably delayed or withheld or (b) withheld solely
                  because the assignment or transfer may result in an increase
                  to the Mandatory Cost Rate.

         35.3.4   Any assignment or transfer by a Bank shall be in respect of
                  a pro rata amount of such Bank's participation in each
                  Facility.

35.4     Assignments by Banks
         If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
         Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 35.3 (Assignments and

         delivered a notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the other
         Finance Parties that it shall be under the same obligations towards
         each of them as it would have been under if it had been an original
         party hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee shall become a party
         hereto as a "Bank"), the Agent, the Arrangers, the other Banks and
         the Permitted Facilities Provider shall not be obliged to recognise
         such assignee as having the rights against each of them which it
         would have had if it had been such a party hereto.

35.5     Transfers by Banks
         If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits
         and/or obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in
         Clause 35.3 (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer
         may be effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed
         Transfer Certificate executed by such Bank and the relevant
         Transferee in which event, on the later of the Transfer Date
         specified in such Transfer Certificate and the fifth Business Day
         after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Agent on such
         Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of delivery of
         such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

<page>

         35.5.1   to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank
                  party thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights,
                  benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents, the
                  Parent and each of the Obligors and such Bank shall be
                  released from further obligations towards one another under
                  the Finance Documents and their respective rights against
                  one another shall be cancelled (such rights and obligations
                  being referred to in this Clause 35.5 as "discharged rights
                  and obligations");

         35.5.2   the Parent, each of the Obligors and the Transferee party
                  thereto shall assume obligations towards one another and/or
                  acquire rights against one another which differ from such

                  acquired the same in place of the Parent, the Obligors and

         35.5.3   the Agent, the Arrangers, the Permitted Facilities Provider,
                  such Transferee and the other Banks shall acquire the same
                  rights and benefits and assume the same obligations between
                  themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had such
                  Transferee been an original party hereto as a Bank with the
                  rights, benefits and/or obligations acquired or assumed by
                  it as a result of such transfer and to that extent the
                  Agent, the Arrangers, the Permitted Facilities Provider, the
                  other Banks and the relevant Bank shall each be released
                  from further obligations to each other under the Finance
                  Documents; and

         35.5.4   such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "Bank".

                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

         35.6.2   as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
                  assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an
                  Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee,
                  Transferee or the Bank acting through its new Facility
                  Office under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up), Clause 15.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) or Clause 17 (Increased Costs),

         then the assignee, Transferee or the Bank acting through its new
         Facility Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those
         Clauses to the same extent as the assignor, transferor or the Bank
         acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
         assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

                  benefits hereunder or transfer all or any of their rights,

                            or grant any interest over the sub-participation

                  (b)       the sub-participant enters into an undertaking in
                            favour of each Obligor to abide by the terms

44.      GOVERNING LAW

         This Agreement is governed by English law.

45.      JURISDICTION

45.1     English Courts
         The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
         dispute (a "Dispute") arising out of or in connection with this
         Agreement (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or
         termination of this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

45.2     Convenient Forum
         The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
         and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and,
         accordingly, that they will not argue to the contrary.

45.3     Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction
         This Clause 45 is for the benefit of the Finance Parties only. As a
         result and notwithstanding Clause 45.1 (English Courts), it does not
         prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a
         Dispute ("Proceedings") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the
         extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent
         Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

45.4     Service of Process
         The Parent and each Original Obligor agrees that the documents which
         start any Proceedings and any other documents required to be served
         in relation to those Proceedings may be served on it:

         45.4.1   in the case of the Parent, on NTL Group Limited at NTL
                  House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire RG27 9XA
                  or, if different, its registered office.

         45.4.2   in the case of each Original Obligor, on NTL Group Limited
                  at NTL House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire
                  RG27 9XA or, if different, its registered office.

         If the Parent or any Original Obligor ceases to have a place of
         business in Great Britain or, as the case may be, the appointment of
         the person mentioned in this Clause 45.4 (Service of Process) ceases
         to be effective, the Parent or the relevant Original Obligor shall
         immediately appoint another person in England to accept service of
         process on its

                                    -109-
<page>

         behalf in England. If the Parent or an Original Obligor fails to do
         so (and such failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen
         days), the Agent shall be entitled to appoint such a person by notice
         to the Parent or, as the case may be, the relevant Original Obligor.
         Nothing contained herein shall restrict the right to serve process in
         any other manner allowed by law. This Clause 45.4 (Service of
         Process) applies to Proceedings in England and to Proceedings
         elsewhere.

This Agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of
this Agreement.

                                 SCHEDULE 10
                                MANDATORY COSTS

1.       The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to
         compensate Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements
         of the Financial Services Authority (or any other authority which
         replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the
         European Central Bank.

2.       On the first day of each Interest Period or Term, as the case may be,
         (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a
         percentage rate, a rate (the "additional costs rate") for each Bank,
         in accordance with the formula set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate
         will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted average of such Bank's
         additional costs rates rounded to five decimal places (weighted in
         proportion to the percentage participation of each Bank in the
         relevant Advance) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per
         annum.

3.       The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by
         that Bank to the Agent as the cost of complying with the minimum
         reserve requirements of the European Central Bank.

4.       The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

                       F x 0.01
                       --------  per cent. per annum.
                         300

         Where F is the rate of charge payable by that Bank to the Financial
         Services Authority pursuant to the Fee Regulations (but, for this
         purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to the Fee
         Regulations) and expressed in pounds per (pound)1,000,000 of the Fee
         Base of that Bank.

5.       For the purposes of this Schedule:

         (a)      "Fee Regulations" means the Banking Supervision (Fees)
                  Regulations 1999 or such other law as may be in force from
                  time to time in respect of the payment of fees for banking
                  supervision; and

         (b)      "Fee Base" has the meaning given to it, and will be
                  calculated in accordance with, the Fee Regulations.

6.       Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
         purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
         without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information
         in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

         (a)      its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of
                  its Facility Office; and

         (b)      such other information that the Agent may reasonably require
                  for such purpose.

         Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to
         the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

                                    -131-
<page>

7.       The rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of F above shall be
         determined by the Agent based upon the information supplied to it
         pursuant to paragraph 6 above and on the assumption that unless a
         Bank notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations in
         relation to the Fee Regulations are the same as those of a typical
         bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in
         the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.

         The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
         results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates
         any Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information
         provided by any Bank pursuant to paragraph 6 above is true and
         correct in all respects.

8.       The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant
         to the Mandatory Cost Rate to the Banks on basis of the additional
         cost rate incurred by each Bank, as calculated in accordance with the
         above formula and based on the information provided by each Bank
         pursuant to paragraph 6 above.

9.       Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation
         to a formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or
         any amount payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error,

Dear Sirs

We refer to the CHF 4,100,000,000 credit agreement dated 28 March 2000 (as

Capitalised terms used in this letter shall, unless otherwise stated, have the
meaning given to them in paragraph 11 below.

In consideration of you agreeing to certain information being made available
to us, by our signature of this letter we agree as follows:

1.       Confidentiality Undertaking We undertake (a) to keep the Confidential
         Information confidential and not to disclose it to anyone except as
         provided for by paragraph 2 below and to ensure that the Confidential
         Information is protected with security measures and a degree of care
         that would apply to our own confidential information, (b) to use the
         Confidential Information only for the Permitted Purpose and (c) to
         use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that any person to whom we
         pass any Confidential Information (unless disclosed under paragraph 2
         (c) below) acknowledges and complies with the provisions of this
         letter as if that person were also a party to it (and so bound by its
         terms in your favour).

2.       Permitted Disclosure You agree that we may disclose Confidential
         Information:

         (a)      to any other bank which becomes (or is considering becoming)
                  a bank under the Credit Agreement and their officers,
                  directors, employees and professional advisers only to the
                  extent necessary for the Permitted Purpose and so long as
                  any such other bank has addressed and delivered a letter to
                  you in substantially the same form as this letter;

         (b)      subject to us procuring that the following comply with the

                  Permitted Purpose, and to their auditors;

         (c)      (i) where requested or required by any court of competent
                  jurisdiction or any competent judicial, governmental,
                  supervisory or regulatory body, (ii) where

                  listed or (iii) where required by the laws or regulations of
                  any country with jurisdiction over the affairs of any member
                  of the Group; and

                  advisers, in each case to the extent necessary for the
                  Permitted Purpose, and to our auditors to the extent
                  necessary for auditing our business.

3.       Notification of Required or Unauthorised Disclosure We agree (to the
         extent permitted by law) to inform you promptly of the full
         circumstances of any disclosure under paragraph 2(c) or upon becoming

         regulation or by any competent judicial, governmental, supervisory or
         regulatory body or in accordance with internal policy, or where the

         the information the subject of this letter. No failure or delay in
         exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a
         waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise of any right,
         power or privilege preclude any further exercise thereof or the
         exercise of any other right, power or privileges hereunder. The terms
