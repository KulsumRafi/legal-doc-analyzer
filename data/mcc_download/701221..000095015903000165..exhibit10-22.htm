will pay him a non-qualified, unfunded pension benefit determined by using the benefit
formula under the pension plan of his former employer (National Life Insurance Company)
and his actual salary and bonuses at both National Life and CIGNA, reduced by his actual
vested pension benefits, if any, under the pension plans of National Life and CIGNA. If
Mr. Welch voluntarily leaves CIGNA before age 60, CIGNA will pay Mr. Welch a
non-qualified, unfunded pension benefit equal to the unvested benefit he forfeits under
the CIGNA Pension Plan.  </P>
