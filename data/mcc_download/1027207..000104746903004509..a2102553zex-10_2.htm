Reason, Employee's salary and other benefits, including, without limitation, any bonus described in Section&nbsp;2(b), shall cease at the time of such termination, and Employee shall not be entitled
to any compensation that has not been paid prior to such termination or which has not accrued for services provided prior to such termination; provided, however, that the Employee shall be entitled to
continue to participate in the Company's benefit plans to the extent required by law. Further, subject to paragraph&nbsp;2.3.2 of MIPA, in the event that Employee voluntarily terminates his
employment without Good Reason prior to the termination of the Initial Term of this Agreement, then such termination shall trigger liability as provided in paragraph&nbsp;2.3.2 of said MIPA.
Further, and in addition to the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;2.3.2 of the MIPA, Company shall be entitled, with respect to Employee, to any and all other remedies, whether injunctive relief, damages
or both, to which it would otherwise be entitled to for breach of the MIPA. </FONT></P>
