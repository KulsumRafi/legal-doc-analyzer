use the Premises for any other use or purpose other than the use
described in subparagraph&nbsp;1&nbsp;(D), <U><I>supra</I></U>. Lessee further agrees that it
will at no time use the Premises in any manner which may be deemed a
violation of any municipal (including, but not limited to, municipal
authorities, regulatory agencies and water and sewer authorities),
state or federal law or regulations. Lessee shall comply at its sole
cost and expense with any and all municipal, state and federal
regulations or laws covering Lessee&#146;s occupancy and/or any additional
installations, other than those specifically provided for in this
Lease, which may be required, including, but not limited to, full
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Lessee shall
also comply at its sole cost and expense with any and all reasonable
rules and regulations promulgated by Lessor by notice hereunder. In
the event the installation of a sprinkler system, an emergency
lighting system and/or a fire/smoke alarm or monitoring system or
public sewer or water connection or tapping fees are necessitated by
any governmental body for issuance of a building permit and/or
occupancy permit for the Premises, or generally after the Effective
Date, the actual cost for the providing and installing the system
shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor within ten (10) days of the posted
date of a bill therefore. Twenty One Percent (21%) of the cost thereof
shall be paid prior to the commencement of any work and the balance
shall be escrowed by Lessee in a manner acceptable to Lessor. Lessor
shall not be responsible for obtaining occupancy or other permits for
Lessee. Responsibility for obtaining all necessary occupancy or other
permits shall be the obligation of Lessee, but Lessor shall provide all reasonable
non-financial assistance to Lessee.

Lessee further agrees that it will use every reasonable
precaution against fire or other casualty; peaceably deliver up and
surrender possession of the Premises to the Lessor at the expiration
or sooner termination of this Lease promptly delivering to Lessor at
Lessor&#146;s office all keys for the Premises; and give to Lessor prompt
written notice of any fire or other casualty, or any damage
occurring on or to the Premises.
</font>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lessee further covenants and agrees that it will not, without
first obtaining the consent in writing of Lessor, and without
providing Lessor with reimbursement for any expenses incurred or
incidental to Lessee&#146;s proposed action, do or suffer to be done,
any act, matter or thing objectionable to the property insurance
companies whereby the property insurance or any other insurance now
in force or hereafter to be placed on the Premises, or any part
thereof, or on the building of which the Premises may be a part,
shall become void or suspended, or whereby the same shall be rated as
a more hazardous risk  that at the date of execution of this Lease,
or employ any person or persons objectionable to the underwriting
insurance companies or carry or have any benzene or explosive matter
of any kind in and about the Premises. In case of a breach of this
covenant (in addition to all other remedies given to Lessor in case
of the breach of any of the conditions of covenants of this lease)
Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor as Additional Rent any and all
increase or increases of premiums on insurance carried by Lessor on
the Premises, or any part thereof, or on the building of which the
Premises may be a part, caused in any way by the occupancy of Lessee.

contained in this paragraph, in addition to any other indemnification
provisions set forth in this Lease. Lessee shall deposit no process
wastes into the sanitary sewer system serving the Premises and agrees

</font>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A. The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from
any and all losses, damages and liability for anything and everything
whatsoever (i) arising from or out of the occupancy of the Premises
and use of abutting and nearby common areas or any part thereof or any
sidewalks, streets, driveways, right of way or roadways, adjacent or
nearby thereto, during the term of this Lease, or any Holdover,
Renewal, or Extension Term thereof, by or under the Lessee, the
Lessee&#146;s agents, servants, contractors, sub-contractors, or business
visitors, and (ii) from any loss or damage or liability, as above
described, arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee or any
failure on the Lessee&#146;s part to comply with any of the covenants,
terms and conditions contained in this Lease, or regardless of
Lessee&#146;s fault to the extent of any deductible in any policy of
insurance covering the loss or damage. Provided, however, that
Lessee&#146;s obligations hereunder shall be pro-ratably reduced to the
extent that a particular claim, liability, expense, loss, damage,
demand, fine or cause of action is a result of Lessor&#146;s gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in
the event Lessor is held liable to an employee of Lessee (either an
actual employee or one deemed to be an employee by operation of law)
on account of work-related injuries sustained by such employee,
Lessee shall be liable to Lessor for damages, contribution and
indemnity in any action at law or otherwise. This subparagraph 11(B)
shall constitute &#147;a written contract&#148; between Lessor and Lessee
pursuant to Section 303(b) of the Workmen&#146;s Compensation Act, 77 P.S.
Section 481(b).

12. <u>Assignment and Subletting.</u> Lessee covenants and agrees that
it will not, without first obtaining the consent, in writing of
Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided
the business operations of such assignee on the Premises shall be no
more hazardous than that of Lessee&#146;s present business and shall
comply with the zoning and all other governmental regulations and
regulations of insurance underwriters and without providing Lessor
with reimbursement for any reasonable expenses incurred or incidental
to Lessee&#146;s proposed action, assign, mortgage or pledge this Lease,
or under-let, or sub-lease the Premises, or any part thereof, nor
shall any assignee or sub-lessee assign, mortgage or pledge this Lease
or such sub-lease, without an additional written consent by the
Lessor, which consent may be withheld for any reason whatsoever, or
no reason, and without such consent no such assignment, mortgage or
pledge shall be valid. The above notwithstanding, Lessee shall not
mortgage or pledge this Lease without the prior approval of Lessor,
which approval may be withheld for any reason whatsoever, or no
reason. If the Lessee becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed by
or against the Lessee or a bill in equity or other proceeding for the
appointment of a receiver for the Lessee is filed, or if the real or
personal property of the Lessee shall be sold or levied upon by any
Sheriff, Marshall or Constable, the same shall be a violation of this
covenant. Should the Lessor consent in writing to any such assignment
or subletting, the business of the assignee or the sublessee shall be
no more hazardous than that of Lessee&#146;s present business and shall
comply with the zoning and all other governmental regulations and
regulations of insurance underwriters. Provided, however, Lessee
shall not be relieved of any liability or responsibility under the
terms of this Lease by reason of such assignment or subletting.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An assignment of this Lease shall be deemed to have occurred if
in a single transaction or a related or unrelated series of
transactions, and whether Lessee is a corporation, partnership or
other entity, more than fifty percent (50%) or more of the ownership
interests in Lessee (whether shares, partnership interests,
membership interests or other equity, and whether one or more classes
thereof) are transferred, diluted, reduced, or otherwise affected
with the result that the owners or holders on the date of this Lease
of the ownership interests in each class of equity of Lessee together
cease to own fifty percent (50%) or more of such equity. This section
shall not apply to sale of shares of stock on the NASDAQ National
Listings or the New York or American Stock Exchanges.

the sum of Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars

hereunder. Lessee has on deposit with Lessor a security deposit in
the amount of Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars
($8,750.00) under the terms and conditions of its Prior Lease, which
shall be credited against the security deposit due hereunder.
Additionally, from time to time, as necessary, Lessee shall deposit
with Lessor amounts as determined by Lessor under paragraph 24(D),
<i><u>infra</u></i>., to secure the removal of Alterations and Improvements (as
hereinafter defined) upon termination of the Lease. If Lessee fails
to pay rent or other charges due hereunder, or otherwise defaults
with respect to any provision of this Lease, Lessor may use, apply or
retain all or any portion of said security deposit for the payment of
any rent or other charge in default or for the payment of other sums
to which Lessor may become obligated by reason of Lessee&#146;s default,
or to compensate Lessor for any loss or damage which Lessor may
suffer thereby. If Lessor so uses or applies all or any portion of said
deposit, Lessee shall within ten (10) days after written demand
thereof, deposit funds with Lessor, by good check, in an amount
sufficient to restore said deposit to the full amount herein above
stated and Lessee&#146;s failure to do so shall be a material breach of
this Lease. If Lessee is in default under this Lease more two
(2) times within any twelve (12) month period, irrespective of
whether or not such default is cured, then, without limiting Lessor&#146;s
other rights and remedies provided for in this Lease or at law or
equity, or both, the Lessee, within ten (10) days of notice from
Lessor, shall deposit with Lessor such amount as is necessary to
increase the deposit held by Lessor to two (2) times the amount held
at the time of said notice. Lessor shall not be required to keep said
deposit separate from its general accounts. If Lessee performs all of
Lessee&#146;s obligations hereunder, said deposit, or so much thereof as
had not theretofore been applied by Lessor, shall be returned to
Lessee without interest (or at Lessor&#146;s option, to the last assignee,
if any, of Lessee&#146;s interest hereunder) at the expiration of the term
hereof, and after Lessee has vacated the Premises. No trust
relationship is granted herein between Lessor and Lessee with respect
to said security deposit.

itself or its duly authorized agents, go upon and inspect the Premise
and every part thereof and/or at their option to make repairs,
alterations, and additions to the Premises or the building of which
the Premise is a part. Provided, however, that Lessor agrees that
they will not enter upon the Premise for repairs except during normal
business hours unless said repairs are of an emergency nature.

contrary notwithstanding. In addition, upon such assignment, Lessor

respect to Lessee&#146;s signs, Lessee will save Lessor harmless from any

notice periods if Lessee shall have removed from or shall be in the

A. Lessee may, at its sole cost and expense, make additional
alterations, additions, or improvements to the interior of the
Premises, which is the subject of this Lease (hereinafter called
&#147;Alterations and Improvements&#148;), provided that such
Alterations and Improvements shall not adversely or otherwise affect
the roof and Structural portions of the Premises or the building of
which the Premises is a part in the case of multi-tenant properties,
or any Systems contained therein. <B>THE ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING,
LESSEE SHALL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE ANY HOLES IN OR
PENETRATIONS OF THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN
CONSENT OF LESSOR, WHICH MAY BE WITHHELD, DELAYED OR REFUSED FOR ANY
REASON OR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.</B></font>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B. All such Alterations and Improvements shall be in accordance with
detailed plans and specifications to be supplied by Lessee to Lessor,
which plans shall in all instances first be subject to Lessor&#146;s
prior written approval (&#147;Lessor&#146;s Approval&#148;), which
Lessor&#146;s Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
event that Lessor grants approval for the construction of such
Interior Improvements, Lessor shall also advise Lessee, if Lessor
will allow such Interior Improvements to remain upon the Premises as
of the Lease Termination Date. If Lessor shall determine that such
Interior Improvements are to remain upon the Premises, as of the
Lease Termination Date, Lessee shall be required to restore them to
the same condition as existed upon the initial completion of the
construction of such Interior Improvements and to the specifications
initially approved by the Lessor. In the event that Lessor shall not
confirm in writing to Lessee that such Interior Improvements shall
remain upon the Premises, it shall be deemed to be a requirement that
such Interior Improvements be removed from the Premises prior to the
Lease Termination Date specified in Subparagraph&nbsp;D hereinbelow.
Lessee shall provide Lessor with evidence that each contractor
performing work on the Premises has adequate workmen&#146;s
compensation insurance, Commercial General Liability insurance, and
Vehicular Liability insurance (written on an occurrence basis) in the
amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence
and at least Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) aggregate as to the
Premises for bodily injury, including death, personal injury and
property damage, in the form of a certificate from an insurer, who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, to the effect that such
insurance may not be canceled or substantially modified without at
least thirty (30) days&#146; prior written notice, certified mail,
return receipt requested, to Mark Hankin, personally, as authorized
representative of Lessor. Said insurance policies shall be with an
insurance company having a Best Rating of A and shall name Lessor, Montgomery County Industrial Development
Authority, any mortgagee of record and other appropriate parties
designated by Lessor as additional named insureds. Lessor&#146;s
Approval is intended solely for purposes of this Paragraph 24, for
the purpose of providing Lessor with notice of all Alterations and
Improvements, and the opportunity to reject any adverse effect on the
Premises and Lessor&#146;s obligations under this Lease.
Lessor&#146;s Approval shall not signify approval by Lessor of the
design or functionality of any Alterations and Improvements and shall
not confer any rights whatsoever on third parties.</font>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C. No Alterations and Improvements by Lessee at the Premises shall be
done except after filing a waiver of mechanic&#146;s lien in
accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 hereinabove. A
time-stamped copy of each &#147;mechanic&#146;s lien&#148; waiver
shall be filed with Lessor prior to the commencement of any work or
purchase of any material by Lessee or any subcontractor.</font>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
D. As to Alterations and Improvements installed with prior
Lessor&#146;s Approval, Lessee may, or at Lessor&#146;s demand,

term of this Lease and Lessee shall at its own cost and expense,

event, in violation of subparagraph B hereof, Lessee installs
Alterations and Improvements upon the Premises without prior
Lessor&#146;s Approval, Lessee shall remove all Alterations and

expense, returning the Premises to its condition as of the Lease
Commencement Date. In the event Lessee shall fail to remove the
Alterations and Improvements and restore the Premises, as herein
provided, Lessor shall have the right to go upon the Premises and do
so, and Lessee agrees to pay the cost thereof plus Twenty One Percent
(21%) of the cost thereof, as Additional Rent. Additionally, Lessor
may decline to accept surrender of the Premises by Lessee so long as
such Alterations and Improvements have not been removed and until
removal of the same and restoration of the Premises, Lessee shall be
deemed to have held over under the provisions  of paragraph 2(C),
<U>supra</U>. With respect to those Alterations and Improvements
which, with Lessor&#146;s consent, have remained upon the Premises
at the end of the term of this Lease, Lessee agrees that title to the
same shall vest in Lessor. Prior to commencing to install any
Alterations or Improvements, Lessee shall deposit with Lessor an
additional security deposit, to be held by Lessor in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph 14, <U>supra</U>., in an amount
reasonably established by Lessor to cover the cost of removal of said

authorization from the Lessor, any person and/or property shall be
injured and/or damaged, liability therefore shall be the sole
responsibility of Lessee.</font>

with any and all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations
and requirements of the municipal and other duly constituted
governmental authorities and insurance organizations.

G. It is understood and agreed that no Alterations and Improvements
to any portion of the Premises except the interior of the Building
(&#147;Exterior Alterations and Improvements&#148;) may be performed
by Lessee, except in full compliance with any conditions established
by Lessor, in writing prior to the  performance thereof. Lessee must
first obtain Lessor&#146;s Approval for any such Exterior Alterations
and Improvements, which Lessor&#146;s Approval may be withheld for
any reason whatsoever, whereupon all of the remaining provisions of
this Paragraph 24 relating to the duties and responsibilities of the
Lessee shall apply to all such proposed Exterior Alterations and
Improvements. All such Exterior Alterations and Improvements are to
be made at Lessee&#146;s sole cost and expense.</font>

written notice at least six&nbsp;(6) months prior thereto, and Lessor
may terminate this Lease at the end of this term and any renewal or
extension thereof by giving to Lessee written notice at least
