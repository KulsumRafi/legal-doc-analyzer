(d)   The  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement by the Servicer and the
performance  and  compliance  with the terms of this Agreement by the Servicer
will not violate the Articles of  Association  or Bylaws of the  Servicer,  or
constitute  a material  default  (or an event  which,  with notice or lapse of

creditors'  rights in  general,  as they may be applied in the  context of the
insolvency  of  a  national  banking   association,   and  by  general  equity

proceeding  in  equity  or  at  law),  and  by  public  policy  considerations

order,  writ,  judgment  or decree of any court,  arbitrator  or  governmental

the Issuer is bound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Section 2.03 <U>Enforcement
of Representations and Warranties</U>. The Servicer, on behalf of and subject to
the direction of the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans, or the
Issuer, shall enforce the representations and warranties of the Seller pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement. Upon the discovery by the Seller, the Depositor, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the Enhancer or the Issuer of a breach of any
of the representations and warranties made by the Seller in the Purchase
Agreement, in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially and adversely
affects the interests of the Securityholders or the Enhancer, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties.
The Servicer shall promptly notify the Seller of such breach and request that,
pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Seller either (i) cure such
breach in all material respects within 90 days from the date the Seller was
notified of such breach or (ii) purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Issuer at
the price and in the manner set forth in Section&#160;3.1(d) of the Purchase
Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Seller shall, subject to
the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, have the option to
substitute an Eligible Substitute Loan or Loans for such Mortgage Loan. In the
event that the Seller elects to substitute one or more Eligible Substitute Loans
pursuant to Section&#160;3.1(d) of the Purchase Agreement, the Seller shall
deliver to the Servicer, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, with respect
to such Eligible Substitute Loans, the original Loan Agreement, the Mortgage,
and such other documents and agreements as are required by the Purchase
Agreement. Payments due with respect to Eligible Substitute Loans in the month
of substitution shall not be transferred to the Issuer and will be retained by
the Servicer and remitted by the Servicer to the Seller on the next succeeding
Payment Date except to the extent that a payment less than the applicable
Minimum Monthly Payment has been received by the Issuer for such month in
respect of the Mortgage Loan to be removed. The Servicer shall amend or cause to
be amended the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of such Mortgage
Loan and the substitution of the Eligible Substitute Loans and the Servicer
shall promptly deliver the amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Owner Trustee
and Indenture Trustee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to cure such breach
or purchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan as to which such a breach has
occurred and is continuing shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such
breach available to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, as pledgee of the
Mortgage Loans, against the Seller. In connection with the purchase of or
substitution for any such Mortgage Loan by the Seller, the Issuer shall assign
to the Seller all of its right, title and interest in respect of the Purchase

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)   The Trust,  by  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement,  does hereby
appoint the  Servicer  for,  and subject to the terms of this  Agreement,  the
Servicer  assumes  responsibility  for, the  servicing of the Mortgage  Loans.
Each  original  Mortgage  File  and any  Related  Documents  delivered  to the
Servicer by the Seller  pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement  shall be
held in trust by the Servicer for the benefit of the Trust in accordance  with
the terms of this Agreement.  The Servicer's  possession of any portion of any
original  Mortgage  File,  any Related  Documents or copies  thereof  shall be
maintained in accordance  with the  provisions of this Agreement to facilitate
the servicing of the related Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)   The  Servicer  shall  service and  administer  the  Mortgage  Loans in a
manner  generally  consistent  with  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  and  the
collection  policy set forth on Exhibit B (the  "Collection  Policy") and in a
manner that shall be normal and usual in its  mortgage  servicing  activities.
Subject to the Collection  Policy and the terms of this  Agreement  (including
without  limitation  Sections  3.08 and 3.09),  the  Servicer  shall have full
power  and  authority  to do any  and  all  things  in  connection  with  such
servicing and  administration  which it may deem  necessary or  desirable,  it
being  understood,  however,  that  the  Servicer  shall at all  times  remain
responsible  to the Issuer and the Indenture  Trustee for the  performance  of
its duties and obligations hereunder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Servicer will at all times apply the same standards and follow the same
procedures with respect to the decision to commence litigation, and in
prosecuting and litigating with respect to the Mortgage Loans as it applies and
follows with respect to mortgage loans like the Mortgage Loans generally. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)   The Servicer  shall enforce the  respective  rights and interests of the
Indenture  Trustee in and under each  Mortgage  Loan,  including the Mortgaged
Property and any other  related  security.  The Servicer is hereby  authorized
and empowered, in performing its duties hereunder,  subject to the limitations
set forth  herein,  to execute and deliver,  on behalf of itself,  the Issuer,
the Indenture  Trustee or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction
or  cancellation,  or of partial or full  release or  discharge  and all other
comparable  instruments  with respect to the Mortgage  Loans and the Mortgaged
Properties.  The  Issuer  and the  Indenture  Trustee,  as  applicable,  shall
furnish  the  Servicer  with  any  powers  of  attorney  and  other  documents
necessary or  appropriate  to enable the  Servicer to carry out its  servicing
and  administrative  duties hereunder.  In addition,  the Servicer may, at its
own  discretion  and  on  behalf  of  the  Indenture  Trustee,  obtain  credit
information in the form of a "credit score" from a credit  repository.  On the
Closing Date,  the  Indenture  Trustee shall deliver to the Servicer a limited
power of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
costs incurred by the Servicer in respect of Servicing Advances shall, for the
purposes of distributions to the Noteholders, be added to the amount owing under
the related Mortgage Loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Servicer, in servicing and
administering the Mortgage Loans, shall employ or cause to be employed
procedures (including collection, foreclosure and management procedures with
respect to REO Property) and exercise the </FONT></P>

</FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=3 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>
<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>same care that it customarily employs
and exercises in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account,
in accordance with accepted mortgage servicing practices of prudent lending
institutions servicing mortgage loans similar to the Mortgage Loans and giving
due consideration to the Noteholders&#146; and the Trust&#146;s reliance on the
Servicer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Mortgage did not have a Lien senior to the related Mortgage Loan on the
related Mortgaged Property as of the Cut-Off Date, then the Servicer, in such
capacity, may not consent to the placing of a Lien senior to that of the
Mortgage on the related Mortgaged Property. If the Mortgage had a Lien senior to
the related Mortgage Loan on the related Mortgaged Property as of the Cut-Off
Date, then the Servicer, in such capacity, may consent to the refinancing of
such prior senior Lien, provided that (i) the resulting CLTV of such Mortgage
Loan is no higher than the greater of the CLTV prior to such refinancing or
100%; (ii) the interest rate for the loan evidencing the refinanced senior Lien
is no higher than the interest rate on the loan evidencing the existing senior
Lien immediately prior to the date of such refinancing (meaning, in the case of
an adjustable rate loan, a substantially similar index and a gross margin no
higher than that of the existing senior Lien); and (iii) the loan evidencing the
refinanced senior Lien is not subject to negative amortization. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with servicing the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer may take reasonable
actions to encourage or effect the termination of Loan Agreements that have
become dormant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
relationship of the Servicer (and of any successor to the Servicer as servicer
under this Agreement) to the Issuer under this Agreement is intended by the
parties to be that of an independent contractor and not that of a joint
venturer, partner or agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)   The Servicer may enter into  Subservicing  Agreements with  Subservicers
for the  servicing  and  administration  of  certain  of the  Mortgage  Loans,
provided that  notwithstanding  such  appointment,  the Servicer  shall remain
liable  for the  performance  of all  servicing  duties  delegated  by it. The
Servicer  shall  provide  written  notice  to the  Indenture  Trustee  and the
Enhancer  upon  entering  into a  Subservicing  Agreement.  References in this
Agreement to actions  taken or to be taken by the  Servicer in  servicing  the
Mortgage  Loans  include  actions  taken or to be taken  by a  Subservicer  on
behalf of the Servicer and any amount  actually  received by such  Subservicer
in  respect of a Mortgage  Loan shall be deemed to have been  received  by the
Servicer whether or not actually  received by the Servicer.  Each Subservicing
Agreement will be upon such terms and conditions as are not inconsistent  with
this Agreement and as the Servicer and the Subservicer  have agreed.  With the
approval  of  the  Servicer,   a   Subservicer   may  delegate  its  servicing
obligations  to  third-party  servicers,  but such  Subservicers  will  remain
obligated  under the related  Subservicing  Agreements.  The  Servicer and the
Subservicer may enter into amendments to the related Subservicing  Agreements;
<U>provided</U>, <U> however</U>,  that any such  amendments  shall not  cause the  Mortgage
Loans to be serviced in a manner that would be  materially  inconsistent  with
the standards set forth in this  Agreement.  The Servicer shall be entitled to
terminate  any  Subservicing  Agreement  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and
conditions  thereof and without any  limitation  by virtue of this  Agreement;
<U>provided</U>, <U> however</U>,  that in the  event  of  termination  of any  Subservicing
Agreement by the Servicer or the  Subservicer,  the Servicer  shall either act
as  servicer  of the  related  Mortgage  Loan  or  enter  into a  Subservicing
Agreement  with a  successor  Subservicer  which will be bound by the terms of
the related  Subservicing  Agreement.  The Servicer shall be entitled to enter
into any agreement with a Subservicer for  indemnification of the Servicer and
nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall be deemed to limit or modify such
indemnification.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the rights, duties and obligations of the Servicer are terminated
hereunder, any successor to the Servicer in its sole discretion may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, terminate the existing Subservicing
Agreement with any Subservicer in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Subservicing Agreement or assume the terminated Servicer&#146;s rights and
obligations under such subservicing arrangements which termination or assumption
will not violate the terms of such arrangements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of its servicing activities hereunder, the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Indenture Trustee, the Enhancer and the Securityholders, shall use reasonable
efforts to enforce the obligations of each Subservicer under the related
Subservicing Agreement, to the extent that the non-performance of any such
obligation would have a material adverse effect on a Mortgage Loan. Such
enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims,
termination of Subservicing Agreements and the pursuit of other appropriate
remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such
time as the Servicer, in its good faith business judgment, would require were it
the owner of the related Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall pay the costs of
such enforcement at its own expense, and shall be reimbursed therefor only (i)
from a general recovery resulting from such enforcement to the extent, if any,
that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage
Loan or (ii) from a specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys fees
against the party against whom such enforcement is directed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)   The  Servicer  shall make  reasonable  efforts to collect  all  payments
called for under the terms and  provisions of the Mortgage  Loans,  and shall,
to the extent such  procedures  shall be  consistent  with this  Agreement and
generally  consistent  with the  Collection  Policy,  follow  such  collection
procedures  as shall be normal  and usual in its  general  mortgage  servicing
activities  and  consistent  with  the  procedures  the  Servicer  employs  in
servicing  all  other   Mortgage   Loans  in  the  servicing   portfolio  with
characteristics  similar to those of the Mortgage  Loans.  Consistent with the
foregoing,  and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer
may in its discretion  (i) waive any late payment charge,  penalty interest or
other  fees which may be  collected  in the  ordinary  course of  servicing  a
Mortgage  Loan and (ii) arrange with a Mortgagor a schedule for the payment of
principal  and  interest  due  and  unpaid;   provided,   however,  that  such
arrangement is consistent  with the  Servicer's  policies with respect to home
equity mortgage  loans.  The Servicer may also extend the Due Date for payment
due on a Mortgage Loan in accordance  with the  Collection  Policy;  provided,
however,  that the  Servicer  shall  first  determine  that any such waiver or
extension  will not impair the  coverage  of any related  insurance  policy or
materially  adversely affect the Lien of the related Mortgage or the interests
of the  Securityholders or the Enhancer,  and the Servicer shall not grant any
such waiver or  extension  that would have any such  effect.  Consistent  with
the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may also:</FONT></P>

Mortgage Loan;</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(v)   capitalize  past due amounts owed under the Mortgage  Loan by adding any
amounts in arrearage to the existing  principal  balance of the Mortgage  Loan
(a  "Capitalization  Workout")  which  will  result  in an  increased  monthly
payment amount,  provided that: (A) the amount added to the existing principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan (the  "Capitalized  Amount")  shall be no greater
than five times the Mortgagor's  current  Minimum Monthly Payment amount;  and
(B) the  Servicer  shall not enter into a  Capitalization  Workout  unless the
CLTV of the  Mortgage  Loan  prior to the  Capitalization  Workout  equals  or
exceeds 80% and the Mortgagor has  qualified  for the  Capitalization  Workout
under the Servicer's servicing guidelines; or</FONT></P>

(vi)  reset the  maturity  date for the Mortgage  Loan,  but in no event shall
such reset date extend beyond the end of the Collection  Period  preceding the
Final Payment Date;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>or any combination of the
foregoing, if in the Servicer&#146;s determination such waiver, modification,
postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the interests of the
Securityholders or the Enhancer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Servicer may not modify or permit any Subservicer to modify any Mortgage Loan
(including without limitation any modification that would change the Loan Rate,
forgive the payment of any principal or interest (unless in connection with the
liquidation of the related Mortgage Loan) or extend the final maturity date of
such Mortgage Loan) unless such Mortgage Loan is in default or, in the judgment
of the Servicer, such default is reasonably foreseeable or except as provided in
Section&#160;3.06. In connection with any such waiver, modification,
postponement or indulgence, the Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to
maximize the receipt of principal and interest thereon. The general terms of any
waiver, modification, forgiveness, postponement or indulgence with respect to
any of the Mortgage Loans will be included in the Servicing Certificate, and
such Mortgage Loans will not be considered &#147;delinquent&#148; for the
purposes of the Basic Documents so long as the Mortgagor complies with the terms
of such waiver, modification, forgiveness, postponement or indulgence. </FONT></P>

Custodial Account," in which the Servicer or the Issuer, as applicable,  shall
deposit  or  cause to be  deposited  any  amounts  representing  payments  and

amounts to be retained as additional servicing compensation in accordance with
Section&#160;3.10 hereof), or amounts received by the Servicer for the accounts
of Mortgagors for application towards the payment of taxes, insurance premiums,
assessments and similar items. In the event any amount not required to be
deposited in the Custodial Account is so deposited, the Servicer may at any time
withdraw such amount from the Custodial Account, any provision herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, and pay such amount to the Person entitled to such
amount. The Servicer shall retain all Foreclosure Profits as additional
servicing compensation. Payments and collections allocable to an Excluded Amount
shall not be deposited into the Custodial Account, the Distribution Account or
the Note Payment Account, but shall be distributed by the Servicer to the Seller
pursuant to Section&#160;3.04. </FONT></P>

Custodial Account, as provided herein, any amounts so advanced. The Servicer may
cause the institution maintaining the Custodial Account to invest any funds in
the Custodial Account in Permitted Investments, which investments shall mature
not later than the Business Day preceding the next succeeding Payment Date, and
which investments shall not be sold or disposed of prior to maturity. In
addition, no such Permitted Investment shall be purchased at a price in excess
of par. Except as provided above, all income and gain realized from any such
investment shall inure to the benefit of the Servicer and shall be subject to
its withdrawal or order from time to time. The amount of any losses incurred in
respect of the principal amount of any such investments shall be deposited in
the Custodial Account by the Servicer out of its own funds immediately as
realized. </FONT></P>

of care with respect to the  possession  of the Mortgage  Files as it would if
they were its own property.  The Mortgage  Files shall at all times be held by

as custodian,  the Servicer shall act with reasonable  care, using that degree
of skill and attention that other servicers  exercise with respect to the loan
files  relating to all  comparable  loans that they  service.  Mortgage  Files
shall  be  held  for  the   benefit   of  the   Indenture   Trustee   and  the

of Hazard Insurance; Property Protection Expenses</U>. To the extent permitted
under the related Loan Agreement and Mortgage, and to the extent the Servicer
receives notice that a hazard insurance policy has been cancelled, the Servicer
shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan hazard insurance naming the
Servicer or related Subservicer as loss payee thereunder providing extended
coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum
insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan from time to
time or (ii) the combined principal balance owing on such Mortgage Loan and any
mortgage loan senior to such Mortgage Loan from time to time; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that such coverage may not be less than the minimum amount
required to fully compensate for any loss or damage on a replacement cost basis.
The Servicer shall use its best efforts to monitor that hazard insurance is
maintained as described in the previous sentence in the same manner as it would
for mortgage loans in its own portfolio. The Servicer shall cause to be
maintained on property acquired upon foreclosure, or deed in lieu of
foreclosure, of any Mortgage Loan, fire insurance with extended coverage in an
amount which is at least equal to the amount necessary to avoid the application
of any co-insurance clause contained in the related hazard insurance policy, the
premium for which shall be a Servicing Advance within the meaning of
Section&#160;3.08. Amounts collected by the Servicer under any such policies
(other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related
Mortgaged Property or property thus acquired or amounts released to the
Mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer&#146;s normal servicing procedures)
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account to the extent called for by
Section&#160;3.03. In cases in which any Mortgaged Property is located at any
time during the life of a Mortgage Loan in a federally designated flood area, to
the extent permitted under the related Loan Agreement and Mortgage, and to the
extent the Servicer receives notice that the related flood insurance has been
cancelled, the hazard insurance to be maintained for the related Mortgage Loan
shall include flood insurance (to the extent available). All such flood
insurance shall be in amounts equal to the lesser of (i) the amount required to
compensate for any loss or damage to the related Mortgaged Property on a
replacement cost basis and (ii) the maximum amount of such insurance available
for such Mortgaged Property under the national flood insurance program (assuming
that the area in which such Mortgaged Property is located is participating in
such program). The Servicer shall use its best efforts to monitor such flood
insurance as described in the previous sentence in the same manner as it would
for mortgage loans in its own portfolio. The Servicer shall be under no
obligation to require that any Mortgagor maintain earthquake or other additional
insurance and shall be under no obligation itself to maintain any such
additional insurance on property acquired in respect of a Mortgage Loan, other
than pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance. If the Servicer shall
obtain and maintain a blanket policy consistent with its general mortgage
servicing activities insuring against hazard losses on all of the Mortgage
Loans, it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set
forth in the first sentence of this Section&#160;3.05, it being understood and
agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case the
Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on the
related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with the first sentence of this
Section&#160;3.05 and there shall have been a loss which would have been covered
by such policy, deposit in the Custodial Account the amount of such loss </FONT></P>

entitled to (a) execute assumption agreements,  substitution  agreements,  and
instruments of  satisfaction  or cancellation or of partial or full release or
discharge,  or any other  document  contemplated  by this  Agreement and other
comparable  instruments with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to
the related  Mortgaged  Properties  (and the Issuer and the Indenture  Trustee
each shall  promptly  execute any such  documents on request of the  Servicer)
and (b)  approve  the  granting  of an  easement  thereon  in favor of another
Person,  any  alteration or demolition of such  Mortgaged  Properties or other
similar  matters,  if it has  determined,  exercising  its good faith business
judgment  in the same  manner as it would if it were the owner of the  related
Mortgage Loans, that the security for, and the timely and full  collectability
of, such Mortgage  Loans would not be adversely  affected  thereby.  A partial
release pursuant to this Section 3.06  shall be permitted only if the CLTV for
the related  Mortgage Loan after such partial release does not exceed the CLTV
for such  Mortgage  Loan as of the  Cut-Off  Date.  Any fee  collected  by the

Mortgage  Loan to (i) change the Loan Rate  payable  on the  related  Mortgage
Loan,  (ii)  increase the credit limit on the related  Mortgage Loan above the
limit  stated in the related  Loan  Agreement,  (iii)  refinance  the existing
senior Lien or place a new senior Lien  related to a Mortgage  Loan  resulting

Balance of the  Mortgage  Loans  modified  by this  Section 3.06(b)  shall not
exceed  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  Pool  Balance  as of the  Cut-Off  Date;
provided,  further,  that any  decision  by the  Servicer to modify a Mortgage
Loan  shall be  normal  and  usual in  accordance  with its  general  mortgage
servicing  activities and consistent with the procedures the Servicer  employs
in  servicing  all  other  Mortgage  Loans  in the  servicing  portfolio  with

the Collection Policy,  foreclose upon or otherwise  comparably convert (which
may include  acquisition  of an REO  Property)  the ownership of any Mortgaged
Property  securing a Mortgage Loan (but shall not sell or convey such Mortgage
Loan) in the  event of a  default  under  the  Mortgage  when no  satisfactory
arrangements  can be made for  collection of delinquent  payments  pursuant to
Section 3.02,  subject to the provisions contained in this Section 3.08(a) and
only if the  Servicer  determines  that  there  is  sufficient  equity  in the
related  Mortgaged  Property to justify such  foreclosure.  In connection with
such  foreclosure  or other  conversion,  the  Servicer  shall use  reasonable
efforts to realize upon such  defaulted  Mortgage  Loan in such manner as will
maximize the receipt of principal and interest  thereon,  taking into account,
among  other  things,  the timing of  foreclosure  proceedings.  The  Servicer
shall pay all  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by it in any such  proceedings;
provided,  however,  that  such  costs  and  expenses  shall be deemed to be a
"Servicing  Advance" and the Servicer shall be reimbursed therefor as provided
in  Section 3.04  hereof;  provided,  further,  that, in any case in which the
Mortgaged   Property  shall  have  suffered  damage  such  that  the  complete
restoration  thereof is not fully  reimbursable by insurance policies required
to be maintained with respect  thereto,  the Servicer shall not be required to
expend  its own  funds to  restore  such  Mortgaged  Property  unless it shall
determine,  in good faith, that such restoration will increase the Liquidation
Proceeds  to the Trust after  reimbursement  to itself for such  expenses.  In
addition to the  reimbursement  of its costs and expenses,  the Servicer shall
be entitled to a  reasonable  and  customary  fee as agreed to by the Servicer
and the Issuer for  performing  any  foreclosure  activities  pursuant to this
Section 3.08(a), which fee shall be payable pursuant to Section 3.04.</FONT></P>

deposited  in the  Custodial  Account  pursuant  to  Section 3.03  and applied
pursuant to Section 3.04.</FONT></P>

(c)   In connection with such  foreclosure or other  conversion,  the Servicer
shall exercise  collection and  foreclosure  procedures in accordance with the
Collection  Policy and with the same degree of care and skill in its  exercise
or use as it would exercise or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of
its own  affairs.  The Servicer  shall take into account the  existence of any
hazardous  substances,  hazardous  wastes or solid  wastes,  as such terms are
defined  in  the  Comprehensive   Environmental   Response   Compensation  and
Liability  Act, the Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act of 1976, or other

complete such sale and disposition no later than, and the Trust shall not retain
ownership of any REO Property for longer than, 36 months after the date on which
such REO Property is acquired by the Trust. The Servicer shall, either itself or
through an agent selected by the Servicer, manage, conserve, protect and operate
the REO Property in the same manner that it manages, conserves, protects and
operates other foreclosed property for its own account, and in the same manner
that similar property in the same locality as the REO Property is managed. The

sale of the REO Property shall be promptly set aside pursuant to
Section&#160;3.03 as received from time to time and, as soon as practicable
thereafter, the expenses of such sale shall be paid. Any costs or advances of
the Servicer pursuant to this Section&#160;3.09 also shall constitute Servicing

Servicing Advances and unpaid Servicing Fees pursuant to Section&#160;3.04. </FONT></P>

Mortgage, which instrument of satisfaction shall be recorded by the Servicer if
required by applicable law and be delivered to the Person entitled thereto. It
is understood and agreed that any expenses incurred in connection with such
instrument of satisfaction or transfer shall be reimbursed from amounts
deposited in the Custodial Account as provided in Section&#160;3.04. From time

recognized independent public accountants (which firm may also render other
services to the Servicer) to furnish a report to the Issuer, each Rating Agency

established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
assertions made pursuant to Section&#160;3.12 regarding compliance with the
minimum servicing standards set forth in the Uniform Single Attestation Program

Mortgage Loans. Such access shall be afforded without charge, but only upon
reasonable request and during normal business hours at the offices of the
Servicer. Nothing in this Section&#160;3.14 shall derogate from the obligation
of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of
information regarding Mortgagors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide
access as provided in this Section&#160;3.14 as a result of such obligation
shall not constitute a breach of this Section&#160;3.14. </FONT></P>

and  interest  in  the   Mortgage   Loans  and  other   Transferred   Property
constituting  the Trust Estate to the Indenture  Trustee to secure payments on
the Notes.  The Seller  will  deliver  the  original  Loan  Agreements  to the
Servicer on behalf of the Depositor,  endorsed or assigned in blank, to effect
the transfer to the Issuer of the Loan  Agreements  and all related  Mortgages
and  other   loan   documents.   To  avoid   the   unnecessary   expense   and
administrative   inconvenience  associated  with  the  execution  of  multiple
assignment  documents,  the  Seller may  execute  one or more  Assignments  of
Mortgage naming the Indenture  Trustee as assignee.  Notwithstanding  the fact
that such assignments name the Indenture Trustee as the assignee,  the parties
hereto  acknowledge  and agree that the Mortgage  Loans shall for all purposes
be  deemed  to have been  transferred  from the  Seller,  as  designee  of the
Depositor,  to the  Depositor,  from the  Depositor to the Issuer and from the

within 60 days of any such event or  reduction,  at its own expense,  complete
and submit for  recording in the  appropriate  public office for real property
records the  Assignments of Mortgage for each Mortgage Loan,  provided that no
such  recordation  will be  required  in any state  where,  in the  opinion of
counsel  acceptable to the Indenture  Trustee  (which opinion of counsel shall
not be an expense of the Indenture  Trustee),  such  recording is not required
to protect the Indenture  Trustee's interests in the Mortgage Loan against the
claim of any subsequent  transferee or any creditor of the Seller.  While such
assignment  to be recorded is being  recorded,  the  Servicer  shall  retain a
photocopy  of  such  assignment.   If  any  assignment  is  lost  or  returned
unrecorded to the Servicer  because of any defect therein,  the Servicer shall
prepare a substitute  assignment or cure such defect,  as the case may be, and
the Servicer  shall cause such  assignment to be recorded in  accordance  with

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance under clause (i) or (ii) of
the definition of Servicing Default, after the applicable grace periods
specified therein, shall not constitute a Servicing Default if such delay or
failure could not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the
Servicer and such delay or failure was caused by an act of God or the public
enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion or
sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve the Servicer
from using reasonable efforts to perform its respective obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer shall
provide the Indenture Trustee, the Enhancer and the Securityholders with written
notice of any such failure or delay by it, together with a description of its
efforts to so perform its obligations. The Servicer shall immediately notify the
Indenture Trustee, the Enhancer and the Issuer in writing of any Servicing
Default. </FONT></P>

no Enhancer  Default  exists,  the  Enhancer  may send  written  notice to the
Securityholders  of its  intention  to  remove  the  Servicer  and  appoint  a
successor  Servicer  and the date on  which  such  removal  will  take  place;
provided,  however,  that such date shall be at least 30 days from the date of
such  notice.  Neither the  Indenture  Trustee nor the  Securityholders  shall
have the right to initiate  removal of the Servicer if a Servicer  Termination
Trigger has occurred.</FONT></P>

Section 7.02      <U>Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor</U>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)   On and  after the time the  Servicer  receives  a notice of  termination
pursuant  to  Section 7.01  or sends a notice  pursuant to  Section 6.04,  the
Indenture  Trustee as pledgee of the Mortgage  Loans shall itself  become,  or
shall appoint an affiliate of the Indenture  Trustee to become,  the successor
in all  respects  to the  Servicer  in its  capacity  as  servicer  under this
Agreement  and the  transactions  set forth or  provided  for herein and shall
immediately  assume all of the obligations of the Servicer to make advances on
Mortgage  Loans  under  Section 3.03(b)  and  will  be  subject  to all  other
responsibilities,  duties  and  liabilities  relating  thereto  placed  on the
Servicer by the terms and </FONT></P>

provisions hereof as soon as practicable,  but in no
event  later  than 90 days  after  the  Indenture  Trustee  becomes  successor
servicer.  During such 90 day period, the Indenture Trustee,  with the written
consent  of the  Enhancer,  may  require  the  Servicer  being  terminated  to
continue  to  perform  such  servicing  responsibilities  (other  than  making
advances  on the  Mortgage  Loans  under  Section 3.03(b))  as  the  Indenture
Trustee  deems  appropriate.  In such event,  the  Servicer  being  terminated
shall  provide such  services as directed by the  Indenture  Trustee until the
earliest  of  the  date  the  Indenture  Trustee  notifies  such  Servicer  to
discontinue  providing such services,  the date on which a successor  servicer
or  the  Indenture  Trustee  has  assumed  all  responsibilities,  duties  and
liabilities  of  the  Servicer  hereunder  or  the  expiration  of  the 90 day
period.  The Servicer  shall be entitled to the  Servicing  Fee  hereunder for
any period  during which the Servicer is obligated to provide such services as
if no termination  of the Servicer had occurred.  Nothing in this Agreement or
in the Trust  Agreement  shall be construed to permit or require the Indenture
Trustee to (i) succeed to the responsibilities,  duties and liabilities of the
initial  Servicer in its  capacity  as Seller  under the  Purchase  Agreement,
(ii) be  responsible  or  accountable  for any act or omission of the Servicer
prior to the issuance of a notice of termination  hereunder,  (iii) require or
obligate the  Indenture  Trustee,  in its capacity as successor  Servicer,  to
purchase,   repurchase  or  substitute  any  Mortgage  Loan,   (iv)  fund  any
Additional  Balances with respect to any Mortgage Loan, (v) fund any losses on
any  Permitted  Investment  directed  by  any  other  Servicer,   or  (vi)  be
responsible  for  the  representations  and  warranties  of the  Servicer.  As
compensation  therefor,  the  Indenture  Trustee  shall  be  entitled  to such
compensation  as the Servicer would have been entitled to hereunder if no such
notice of termination had been given.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if the
Indenture  Trustee is (x) unwilling to act as successor  Servicer itself or to
appoint an affiliate to become  successor  Servicer,  or (y) legally unable so
to act, the  Indenture  Trustee as pledgee of the  Mortgage  Loans may (in the
situation  described  in clause (x)) or shall (in the  situation  described in
clause (y)) appoint or petition a court of competent  jurisdiction  to appoint
any established housing and home finance  institution,  bank or other mortgage
loan  servicer  having  a net  worth  of  not  less  than  $10,000,000  as the
successor to the Servicer  hereunder in the  assumption  of all or any part of
the  responsibilities,  duties  or  liabilities  of  the  Servicer  hereunder;
provided,  however,  that any such  successor  Servicer shall be acceptable to
the Enhancer,  as evidenced by the  Enhancer's  prior written  consent,  which
consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld.   Pending  appointment  of  a
successor  to  the  Servicer  hereunder,   unless  the  Indenture  Trustee  is
prohibited by law from so acting,  the Indenture  Trustee  itself shall act or
appoint  an  affiliate  to  act  in  such  capacity  as  provided   above.  In
connection  with such  appointment  and  assumption,  the  successor  shall be
entitled to receive  compensation  out of  payments  on  Mortgage  Loans in an
amount  equal to the  compensation  that the  Servicer  would  otherwise  have
received  pursuant  to  Section 3.11  (or  such  other   compensation  as  the
Indenture  Trustee and such  successor  shall  agree).  The  appointment  of a
successor Servicer shall not affect any liability of the predecessor  Servicer
that may  have  arisen  under  this  Agreement  prior  to its  termination  as
Servicer  (including  the  obligation to purchase  Mortgage  Loans pursuant to
Section 3.01,  to pay any  deductible  under an insurance  policy  pursuant to
Section 3.05 or to indemnify the Indenture  Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06),
nor shall any  successor  Servicer be liable for any acts or  omissions of the
predecessor  Servicer  or  for  any  breach  by  such  Servicer  of any of its
representations  or warranties  contained herein or in any related document or
agreement.  The Indenture  Trustee and such successor  shall take such action,
consistent  with this  Agreement and the  requirements  (including  any notice
requirements)  of applicable law, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such
succession.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Indenture  Trustee,  in its
capacity  as  successor  Servicer,  shall not be  responsible  for the lack of
information  and/or documents that it cannot obtain through reasonable efforts
or for  failing  to take any  action  that the  Indenture  Trustee  is legally
prohibited from taking by applicable law.</FONT></P>
