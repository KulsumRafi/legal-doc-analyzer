     Company shall pay to Employee for the services to be rendered hereunder a
     base salary at an annual rate of Two Hundred Sixty One Thousand Dollars
     ($261,000), plus such bonuses (if any) as shall be awarded in the
     discretion of the Board pursuant to Section 3.2. The base salary may be
     increased on an annual basis by the Board in its discretion. Employee's
     salary shall be payable in periodic installments in accordance with the
     Company's usual practice for similarly situated employees of the Company
     and subject to all required withholdings for income taxes, FICA, Medicaid,
     etc."

     2. Section 3.2 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:

     "3.2 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. In addition to the base salary, Employee shall
     be entitled to receive payments under the Company's executive incentive
     compensation and/or bonus programs (as in effect from time to time), if
     any, in such amounts as are determined by the Board to be appropriate for
     similarly situated employees of the Company but in any event not less than
     fifty percent (50%) of the Base Salary."

     3. Section 3.4 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:

     "3.4 EXPENSES. During the term of his employment hereunder, Employee shall
     be entitled to receive reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred

     entitled to a housing and automobile allowance in the amount of $7,500 per
