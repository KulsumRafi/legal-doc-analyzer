                       AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE COMMITMENTS

         SECTION 2.1 General Description of Facilities. Subject to and upon the
terms and conditions herein set forth, (i) the Lenders hereby establish in favor
of the Borrower a revolving credit facility pursuant to which the Lenders
severally agree (to the extent of each Lender's Pro Rata Share up to such
Lender's Revolving Commitment) to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower in
accordance with Section 2.2, (ii) the Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of
Credit in accordance with Section 2.20, and (iii) each Lender agrees to purchase
a participation interest in the Letters of Credit pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof; provided that in no event shall the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, plus the outstanding LC Obligations
exceed at any time the lesser of: (a) the Borrowing Base, and (b) the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments from time to time in effect.

         SECTION 2.2 Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make Revolving Loans to the
Borrower, from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any time that will not result in (a) such
Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment
or (b) the sum of the Loans and the LC Exposure exceeding the lesser of: (i) the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or (ii) the Borrowing Base. During the
Availability Period, the Borrower shall be entitled to borrow, prepay and
reborrow Revolving Loans in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; provided that the Borrower may not borrow or reborrow should there
exist a Default or Event of Default.

         SECTION 2.3 Procedure for Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) of each Borrowing substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.3 attached
hereto (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") (x) prior to 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day
prior to the requested date of each Base Rate Borrowing and (y) prior to 11:00
a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of each Eurodollar
Borrowing. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify: (i)
the aggregate principal amount of such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the Type of such Revolving Loan
comprising such Borrowing and (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to the
provisions of the definition of Interest Period). Each Borrowing shall consist
entirely of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, as the Borrower may request.
The aggregate principal amount of each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be not less
than $1,000,000 or a larger multiple of $500,000, and the aggregate principal
amount of each Base Rate Borrowing shall not be less than $500,000 or a larger
multiple of $100,000; provided that Base Rate Loans made pursuant to Section
2.20(d) may be made in lesser amounts as provided therein. At no time shall the
total number of Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding at any time exceed five (5).
Promptly following the receipt of


<PAGE>

a Notice of Borrowing in accordance herewith, the Administrative Agent shall
advise each Lender of the details thereof and the amount of such Lender's
Revolving Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.4 Funding of Borrowings

                  (a)      Each Lender will make available each Loan to be made
         by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer in
         immediately available funds by 11:00 a.m. to the Administrative Agent
         at the Payment Office. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
         available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts that it
         receives, in like funds by the close of business on such proposed date,
         to an account maintained by the Borrower with the Administrative Agent.

                  (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified by any Lender prior to 5 p.m. one (1) Business Day prior to
         the date of a Borrowing in which such Lender is participating that such
         Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
         Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
         that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative
         Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance on such
         assumption, may make available to the Borrower on such date a
         corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made
         available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender on the date of
         such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover
         such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with
         interest at the Federal Funds Rate for up to two (2) days and
         thereafter at the rate specified for such Borrowing. If such Lender
         does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
         Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall
         promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay
         such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent together with
         interest at the rate specified for such Borrowing. Nothing in this
         subsection shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
         fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing hereunder or to prejudice any
         rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of
         any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  (c)      All Borrowings shall be made by the Lenders on the
         basis of their respective Pro Rata Shares. No Lender shall be
         responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligations
         hereunder, and each Lender shall be obligated to make its Loans
         provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any
         other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.

         SECTION 2.5 Interest Elections.

                  (a)      Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type
         specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, and in the case of a
         Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
         specified in such Notice of Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may
         elect to convert such Borrowing into a different Type or to continue
         such Borrowing, and in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect
         Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The
         Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions
         of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
         allocated


<PAGE>

         ratably among the Lenders holding Loans comprising such Borrowing, and
         the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
         Borrowing.

                  (b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
         Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior written notice (or
         telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing (a
         "NOTICE OF CONVERSION/CONTINUATION") that is to be converted or
         continued, as the case may be, (x) prior to 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business
         Day prior to the requested date of a conversion into a Base Rate
         Borrowing and (y) prior to 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to
         a continuation of or conversion into a Eurodollar Borrowing. Each such
         Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall be irrevocable and shall
         specify (i) the Borrowing to which such Notice of
         Continuation/Conversion applies and if different options are being
         elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions
         thereof that are to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which
         case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv)
         shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective
         date of the election made pursuant to such Notice of
         Continuation/Conversion, which shall be a Business Day, (iii) whether
         the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurodollar
         Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar
         Borrowing, the Interest Period applicable thereto after giving effect
         to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the
         definition of "Interest Period". If any such Notice of
         Continuation/Conversion requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not
         specify an Interest Period, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         selected an Interest Period of one month. The principal amount of any
         resulting Borrowing shall satisfy the minimum borrowing amount for
         Eurodollar Borrowings and Base Rate Borrowings set forth in Section
         2.3.

                  (c)      If, on the expiration of any Interest Period in
         respect of any Eurodollar Borrowing, the Borrower shall have failed to
         deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, then, unless such
         Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to
         have elected to convert such Borrowing to a Base Rate Borrowing. No
         Borrowing may be converted into, or continued as, a Eurodollar
         Borrowing if a Default or an Event of Default exists, unless the
         Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall have otherwise
         consented in writing. No conversion of any Eurodollar Loans shall be
         permitted except on the last day of the Interest Period in respect
         thereof.

                  (d)      Upon receipt of any Notice of
         Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
         each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each
         resulting Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.6 Optional Reduction and Termination of Commitments.

                  (a)      Unless previously terminated, all Revolving
         Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.

                  (b)      Upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written
         notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
         Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable), the Borrower
         may reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments in part or terminate the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments in whole; provided that (i) any partial




<PAGE>
         reduction shall apply to reduce proportionately and permanently the
         Revolving Commitment of each Lender, (ii) any partial reduction
         pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be in an amount of at least
         $1,000,000 and any larger multiple of $1,000,000, and (iii) no such
         reduction shall be permitted which would reduce the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments to an amount less than the outstanding Revolving Credit
         Exposures of all Lenders. Any such reduction in the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments shall result in a proportionate reduction (rounded to the
         next lowest integral multiple of $100,000) LC Commitment.

         SECTION 2.7 Repayment of Loans. The outstanding principal amount of all
Revolving Loans shall be due and payable (together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon) on the Commitment Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.8 Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
         usual practice appropriate records evidencing the indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender
         from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
         payable thereon and paid to such Lender from time to time under this
         Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall maintain appropriate records
         in which shall be recorded (i) the Revolving Commitment of each Lender,
         (ii) the amount of each Loan made hereunder by each Lender, the Type
         thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) the date of
         each continuation thereof pursuant to Section 2.5, (iv) the date of
         each conversion of all or a portion thereof to another Type pursuant to
         Section 2.5, (v) the date and amount of any principal or interest due
         and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
         Lender hereunder in respect of such Loans and (vi) both the date and
         amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from
         the Borrower in respect of the Loans and each Lender's Pro Rata Share
         thereof. The entries made in such records shall be prima facie evidence
         of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein
         recorded; provided that the failure or delay of any Lender or the
         Administrative Agent in maintaining or making entries into any such
         record or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans (both principal and
         unpaid accrued interest) of such Lender in accordance with the terms of
         this Agreement.

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees that it will execute and deliver
         to each Lender a Revolving Credit Note, payable to the order of such
         Lender, in the amount of such Lender's Revolving Commitment.

         SECTION 2.9 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty, by giving irrevocable written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent no later than
(i) in the case of prepayment of any Eurodollar Borrowing, 11:00 a.m. not less
than three (3) Business Days prior to any such prepayment, and (ii) in the case
of any prepayment of any Base Rate Borrowing, not less than one (1) Business Day
prior to the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the proposed date of such prepayment and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be


<PAGE>
prepaid. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each affected Lender of the contents thereof and of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of any such prepayment. If such notice is given, the
aggregate amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
designated in such notice, together with accrued interest to such date on the
amount so prepaid in accordance with Section 2.10(b); provided that if a
Eurodollar Borrowing is prepaid on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay all amounts required
pursuant to Section 2.16. Each partial prepayment of any Loan shall be in an
amount not less than the minimum amount that would be permitted in the case of
an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type pursuant to Section 2.2. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans comprising such
Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.10 Interest on Loans.

                  (a)      While an Event of Default exists or after
         acceleration, at the option of the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall
         pay interest ("DEFAULT INTEREST") with respect to all Eurodollar Loans
         at the rate otherwise applicable for the then-current Interest Period
         plus an additional two percent (2%) per annum until the last day of
         such Interest Period, and thereafter, and with respect to all Base Rate
         Loans and all other Obligations hereunder (other than Loans), at the
         rate in effect from time to time for Base Rate Loans, plus an
         additional two percent (2%) per annum.

                  (b)      Interest on the principal amount of all Loans shall
         accrue from the date such Loans are made to the date of any repayment
         thereof. Interest on all outstanding Base Rate Loans shall be payable
         in arrears on the last day of each calendar month and on the Commitment
         Termination Date. Interest on all outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be
         payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto,
         and, in the case of any Eurodollar Loans having an Interest Period in
         excess of three months or ninety (90) days, respectively, on each day
         which occurs every three months or ninety (90) days, as the case may
         be, after the initial date of such Interest Period, and on the
         Commitment Termination Date. All Default Interest shall be payable on
         demand.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall determine each
         interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder and shall promptly
         notify the Borrower and the Lenders of such rate in writing (or by
         telephone, promptly confirmed in writing). Any such determination shall
         be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.11 Fees.

                  (a)      Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower shall pay to
         the Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at
         the times previously agreed upon the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent.

                  (b)      Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent a facility fee equal to one quarter of one percent
         (.25%) per annum on the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. The Facility
         Fee shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
         September, and December of each year and on the Commitment Termination
         Date.
<PAGE>

                  (c)      Payments. Accrued fees shall be payable quarterly in
         arrears on the last day of each March, June, September, and December
         (commencing June 30, 2002) of each year and on the Commitment
         Termination Date.

                  (d)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i)
         to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a letter
         of credit fee with respect to its participation in each Letter of
         Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Margin on the average
         daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion
         thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to
         such Letter of Credit during the period from the date of issuance of
         such Letter of Credit to the date on which such Letter of Credit
         expires or is drawn in full (including without limitation any LC
         Exposure that remains outstanding after the Commitment Termination
         Date) and (ii) to the Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee,
         which shall accrue at the rate of .125% per annum on the average daily
         amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable
         to Unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the Availability Period (or
         until the date that such Letter of Credit is irrevocably canceled,
         whichever is later), as well as the Issuing Bank's standard
         administrative fees with respect to issuance, amendment, renewal or
         extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.

         SECTION 2.12 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of
interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable (to the
extent computed on the basis of days elapsed). Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest amount or fee hereunder shall be made in
good faith and, except for manifest error, shall be presumed correct for all
purposes.

         SECTION 2.13 Inability to Determine Interest Rates. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing,

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
         determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that,
         by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank market,
         adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest
         Period, or

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
         from the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate does not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender, as
         the case may be) of making, funding or maintaining their (or its, as
         the case may be) Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give written notice (or telephonic notice,
promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Lenders as soon as
practicable thereafter. In the case of Eurodollar Loans, until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) the obligations of
the Lenders to make Eurodollar Revolving Loans or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) all
such affected Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable thereto unless the
<PAGE>

Borrower prepays such Loans in accordance with this Agreement. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before the
date of any Eurodollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously
been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, then such Borrowing shall
be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.14 Illegality. If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund any Eurodollar Loan and such
Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the other Lenders, whereupon
until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of
such Lender to make Eurodollar Revolving Loans, or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Revolving Loans, shall be suspended. In
the case of the making of a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Lender's Loan shall be
made as a Base Rate Loan as part of the same Borrowing for the same Interest
Period and if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, such Loan shall
be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current
Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (ii) immediately if such Lender
shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar
Loan to such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affected Lender shall,
prior to giving such notice to the Administrative Agent, designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if such designation would avoid the need for giving
such notice and if such designation would not otherwise be disadvantageous to
such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

         SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs.

                  (a)      If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit or similar requirement that is not
                  otherwise included in the determination of the Adjusted LIBO
                  Rate hereunder against assets of, deposits with or for the
                  account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
                  reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or
                  the Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii)     impose on any Lender or on the Issuing Bank
                  or the eurodollar interbank market any other condition
                  affecting this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loans made by such
                  Lender or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein;

         and the result of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost to such
         Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining a
         Eurodollar Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank of participating in or issuing any Letter of Credit or to reduce
         the amount received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
         hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then
         the Borrower shall promptly pay, upon written notice from and demand by
         such Lender on the Borrower (with a copy of such notice and demand to
         the Administrative Agent), to the Administrative Agent for the account
         of such Lender, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such
         notice and demand, additional amount or amounts sufficient to
         compensate such Lender or the

<PAGE>

         Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs actually
         incurred or reduction actually suffered.

                  (b)      If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have
         determined that on or after the date of this Agreement any Change in
         Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
         actually reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing
         Bank's capital (or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing
         Bank's parent corporation) as a consequence of its obligations
         hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level
         below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or
         the Issuing Bank's parent corporation could have achieved but for such
         Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing
         Bank's policies or the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
         parent corporation with respect to capital adequacy) then, from time to
         time, within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of
         written demand by such Lender (with a copy thereof to the
         Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
         additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank
         or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's parent corporation for any such
         reduction actually suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
         forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the
         Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's parent corporation,
         as the case may be, specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
         shall be delivered to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
         Agent) and shall be presumed correct, absent manifest error. The
         Borrower shall pay any such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
         be, such amount or amounts within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
         Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
         constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to
         demand such compensation.

         SECTION 2.16 Funding Indemnity. In the event of: (a) the payment of any
principal of a Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion or continuation of a Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (c) the failure by the Borrower to
borrow, prepay, convert or continue any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in
any applicable Notice of Borrowing (regardless of whether such notice is
withdrawn or revoked), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate
each Lender, within five (5) Business Days after written demand from such
Lender, for any loss, cost or expense attributable to such event. In the case of
a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense shall be deemed to include an
amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of
interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan
if such event had not occurred at the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to such
Eurodollar Loan for the period from the date of such event to the last day of
the then current Interest Period therefor (or in the case of a failure to
borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Loan) over (B) the amount of interest that would
accrue on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan for the same period if
the Adjusted LIBO Rate were set on the date such Eurodollar Loan was prepaid or
converted or the date on which the Borrower failed to


<PAGE>
borrow, convert or continue such Eurodollar Loan. A certificate as to any
additional amount payable under this Section 2.16 submitted to the Borrower by
any Lender shall be presumed correct, absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.17 Taxes.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by or on account of any
         obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of
         and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes; provided that if the
         Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such
         payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
         that after making all required deductions (including deductions
         applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
         Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may
         be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
         no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
         deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
         the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower shall be responsible for
         the payment of any Indemnified Taxes to the relevant Governmental
         Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
         Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within five (5) Business Days
         after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified
         Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
         account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including
         Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts
         payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable
         expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto as a result of the
         Borrower's failure to comply with this Section 2.17(c) in a timely
         manner. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
         delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
         Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the
         Issuing Bank, shall be presumed correct absent manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
         Indemnified Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the
         Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
         certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
         evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or
         other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent.

                  (e)      Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
         from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
         in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such
         jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement
         shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
         Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such
         properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
         law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such
         payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Foreign Lender agrees
         that it will deliver to


<PAGE>
         the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (or in the case of a
         Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall
         have been purchased) two (2) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form 1001 or 4224, or any successor form thereto, as the case
         may be, certifying in each case that such Foreign Lender is entitled to
         receive payments made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes
         payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any United States
         federal income taxes and (ii) a duly completed Internal Revenue Service
         Form W-8 or W-9, or any successor form thereto, as the case may be, to
         establish an exemption from United State backup withholding tax. Each
         such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent such forms on or before the date that it becomes a
         party to this Agreement (or in the case of a Participant, on or before
         the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In
         addition, each such Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
         obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such
         Lender. Each such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent at any time that it determines that it is no
         longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to
         the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S.
         taxing authorities for such purpose).

         SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
         Set-Offs.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall make each payment required to be
         made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
         reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section
         2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, on the Business
         Day when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
         counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in
         the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been
         received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
         calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the
         Administrative Agent at the Payment Office, except payments to be made
         directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except
         that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 and 10.3 shall
         be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative
         Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account
         of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
         receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is
         not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
         succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
         interest, interest thereon shall be made payable for the period of such
         extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
         available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of
         principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due
         hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
         interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
         entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
         then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
         and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the
         parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
         and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.


<PAGE>

                  (c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
         set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
         principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or
         participations in LC Disbursements that would result in such Lender
         receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
         its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued
         interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
         the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash
         at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations
         in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that
         the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably
         in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
         interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC
         Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are
         purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
         recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
         price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
         (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply
         to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
         the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender
         as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
         any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee
         or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
         Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall
         apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
         extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
         acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
         exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with
         respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
         creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
         notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the
         Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment,
         the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such
         payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
         such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the
         case may be, the amount or amounts due. In such event, if the Borrower
         has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
         Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
         Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
         such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from
         and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
         excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
         greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by
         the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
         interbank compensation.

                  (e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required
         to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.20(d) or (e), 2.18(d) or
         10.3(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
         (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts
         thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
         Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until
         all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

<PAGE>
         SECTION 2.19 Mitigation of Obligations. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the sole judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable under
Section 2.17 or Section 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would
not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
all costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with such
designation or assignment.

         SECTION 2.20 Letters of Credit.

                  (a)      During the Availability Period, the Issuing Bank, in
         reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders pursuant to Section
         2.20(d), agrees to issue, at the request of the Borrower, Letters of
         Credit for the account of the Borrower on the terms and conditions
         hereinafter set forth; provided that (i) each Letter of Credit shall
         expire no later than five (5) days prior to the Commitment Termination
         Date; (ii) each Letter of Credit shall be in a stated amount of at
         least $250,000.00; and (iii) the Borrower may not request any Letter of
         Credit, if, after giving effect to such issuance (A) the aggregate LC
         Exposure would exceed the LC Commitment or (B) the aggregate LC
         Exposure, plus the aggregate outstanding Revolving Loans of all
         Lenders, would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. Upon the
         issuance of each Letter of Credit each Lender shall be deemed to, and
         hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the
         Issuing Bank without recourse a participation in such Letter of Credit
         equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available
         to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each issuance of a Letter of
         Credit shall be deemed to utilize the Revolving Commitment of each
         Lender by an amount equal to the amount of such participation.

                  (b)      To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or any
         amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit),
         the Borrower shall give the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent
         irrevocable written notice at least three (3) Business Days prior to
         the requested date of such issuance specifying the date (which shall be
         a Business Day) such Letter of Credit is to be issued (or amended,
         extended or renewed, as the case may be), the expiration date of such
         Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit , the name and
         address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall
         be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.
         In addition to the satisfaction of the conditions in Article III, the
         issuance of such Letter of Credit (or any amendment which increases the
         amount of such Letter of Credit) will be subject to the further
         conditions that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain
         such terms as the Issuing Bank shall approve (such approval not to be
         withheld unreasonably) and that the Borrower shall have executed and
         delivered any additional applications, agreements and instruments
         relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank shall reasonably
         require; provided that in the event of any conflict between such
         applications, agreements or instruments and this Agreement, the terms
         of this Agreement shall control.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      At least two (2) Business Days prior to the issuance
         of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank will confirm with the
         Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
         Administrative Agent has received such notice and if not, the Issuing
         Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless
         the Issuing Bank has received notice from the Administrative Agent on
         or before the Business Day immediately preceding the date the Issuing
         Bank is to issue the requested Letter of Credit directing the Issuing
         Bank not to issue the Letter of Credit because such issuance is not
         then permitted hereunder because of the limitations set forth in
         Section 2.20(a) or that one or more conditions specified in Article III
         are not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
         hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue such
         Letter of Credit in accordance with the Issuing Bank's usual and
         customary business practices.

                  (d)      The Issuing Bank shall examine all documents
         purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit
         promptly following its receipt thereof. The Issuing Bank shall notify
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such demand for payment
         and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make a LC Disbursement
         thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such
         notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse
         the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to such LC Disbursement.
         The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to
         reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursements paid by the Issuing
         Bank in respect of such drawing, without presentment, demand or other
         formalities of any kind. Unless the Borrower shall have notified the
         Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. on the
         Business Day immediately prior to the date on which such drawing is
         honored that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the
         amount of such drawing in funds other than from the proceeds of
         Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a
         Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting the Lenders
         to make a Base Rate Borrowing on the date on which such drawing is
         honored in an exact amount due to the Issuing Bank; provided that for
         purposes solely of such Borrowing, the conditions precedent set forth
         in Section 3.2 hereof shall not be applicable. The Administrative Agent
         shall notify the Lenders of such Borrowing in accordance with Section
         2.3, and each Lender shall make the proceeds of its Base Rate Loan
         included in such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for
         the account of the Issuing Bank in accordance with Section 2.4. The
         proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied directly by the
         Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such LC
         Disbursement.

                  (e)      If for any reason a Base Rate Borrowing may not be
         (as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), or
         is not, made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, then each
         Lender (other than the Issuing Bank) shall be obligated to fund the
         participation that such Lender purchased pursuant to subsection (a) in
         an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such LC Disbursement on and as
         of the date which such Base Rate Borrowing should have occurred. Each
         Lender's obligation to fund its participation shall be absolute and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including,
         without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
         or other right that such Lender or any other Person may have against
         the Issuing Bank or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii)
         the existence of a Default or an

<PAGE>

         Event of Default or the termination of the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
         otherwise) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) any breach
         of this Agreement by the Borrower or any other Lender, (v) any
         amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit, or (vi) any
         other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
         similar to any of the foregoing. On the date that such participation is
         required to be funded, each Lender shall promptly transfer, in
         immediately available funds, the amount of its participation to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank. Whenever, at
         any time after the Issuing Bank has received from any such Lender the
         funds for its participation in a LC Disbursement, the Issuing Bank (or
         the Administrative Agent on its behalf) receives any payment on account
         thereof, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
         be, will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment;
         provided that if such payment is required to be returned for any reason
         to the Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
         similar official in any bankruptcy proceeding, such Lender will return
         to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank any portion thereof
         previously distributed by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank
         to it.

                  (f)      To the extent that any Lender shall fail to pay any
         amount required to be paid pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section
         2.20 on the due date therefor, such Lender shall pay interest to the
         Issuing Bank (through the Administrative Agent) on such amount from
         such due date to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate; provided that if such Lender shall
         fail to make such payment to the Issuing Bank within three (3) Business
         Days of such due date, then, retroactively to the due date, such Lender
         shall be obligated to pay interest on such amount at the Default Rate.

                  (g)      If any Event of Default shall occur and be
         continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from
         the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit
         of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall
         deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
         Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in
         cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued
         and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit
         such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
         deposit shall become immediately due and payable, with demand or notice
         of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect
         to the Borrower described in clause (g) or (h) of Section 8.1. Such
         deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the
         payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this
         Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
         control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
         account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such
         deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
         discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and
         expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest and profits,
         if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in
         such account shall applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the
         Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it had not been reimbursed
         and to the extent so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
         reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such
         time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, with the
         consent of the Required Lenders, be

<PAGE>

         applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
         Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
         collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
         Default, such amount (to the extent not so applied as aforesaid) shall
         be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all
         Events of Default have been cured or waived.

                  (h)      Omitted by Agreement.

                  (i)      The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
         Disbursements hereunder shall be absolute, unconditional and
         irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the
         terms of this Agreement under all circumstances whatsoever and
         irrespective of any of the following circumstances:

                           (i)      Any lack of validity or enforceability of
         any Letter of Credit or this Agreement;

                           (ii)     The existence of any claim, set-off, defense
         or other right which the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
         Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee
         of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons or entities for whom any such
         beneficiary or transferee may be acting), any Lender (including the
         Issuing Bank) or any other Person, whether in connection with this
         Agreement or the Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or
         thereto or any unrelated transaction;

                           (iii)    Any draft or other document presented under
         a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
         respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
         respect, if such documents on their faces appear to be in order;

                           (iv)     Payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter
         of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document to the
         Issuing Bank that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of
         Credit;

                           (v)      Any other event or circumstance whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
         provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge
         of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations
         hereunder; or

                           (vi)     The existence of a Default or an Event of
         Default.

         Neither the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders nor any
         Related Party of any of the foregoing shall have any liability or
         responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
         transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any
         payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred
         to above), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
         transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
         under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document
         required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
         technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the



<PAGE>

         control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be
         construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
         the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages,
         claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the
         extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
         caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
         whether drafts or other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree, that
         in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
         the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
         in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
         limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect
         to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial
         compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may,
         in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
         documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
         of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
         make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
         compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (j)      Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform
         Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision),
         International Chamber of Commerce Publication No.500, as the same may
         be amended from time to time, and, to the extent not inconsistent
         therewith, the governing law of this Agreement set forth in Section
         10.5.

                                  ARTICLE III

               CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

         the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 3.2 Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender to make a
Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing and of the Issuing Bank to issue, amend,
renew or extend any Letter of Credit is subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

                  (a)      at the time of and immediately after giving effect to
         such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such
         Letter of Credit, as applicable, no Default or Event of Default shall

         changes in facts and circumstances that are not prohibited by the terms

<PAGE>

                  (c)      since the date of the most recent financial
         statements of the Borrower described in Section 5.1(a), there shall
         have been no change which has had or could reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (d)      the Administrative Agent shall have received such
         other documents, certificates, information or legal opinions as the
         Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request,

by the Borrower on the date thereof as to the matters specified in paragraphs

Notes, in sufficient counterparts or copies for each of the Lenders and shall be
in form and substance satisfactory in all respects to the Administrative Agent.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender as follows:

         SECTION 4.1 Existence; Power. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries: (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing as a
corporation under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted, and
(iii) is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where a failure to be
so qualified could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 4.2 Organizational Power; Authorization. The execution,
delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is
a party are within such Loan Party's organizational powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary organizational action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Borrower, and constitutes, and each other Loan
Document to which any Loan Party is a party, when executed and delivered by such
Loan Party, will constitute, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower or
such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable against it in accordance with
their respective terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

         SECTION 4.3 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement, and by each Loan
Party of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party (a) do not require any
consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any action by, any
Governmental Authority, except those as have been obtained or


<PAGE>

made and are in full force and effect or where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation
or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not
violate or result in a default under any indenture, material agreement or other
material instrument binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its material assets or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to
be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and (d) will not result in
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, except Liens (if any) created under the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.4 Financial Statements. The Borrower has furnished to each
Lender: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as of August 31, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the end of February 28, 2002,
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for
the fiscal quarter and year-to-date period then ending, certified by a
Responsible Officer. Such financial statements fairly present the consolidated
financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of such dates and
the consolidated results of operations for such periods in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied, subject to year end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii). Since August
31, 2001, there have been no changes with respect to the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which have had or could reasonably be expected to have, singly or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.5 Litigation and Environmental Matters.

                  (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5(a), no
         litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrators or
         Governmental Authorities is pending against or, to the knowledge of the
         Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries: (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an
         adverse determination that could reasonably be expected to have, either
         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii)
         which in any manner draws into question the validity or enforceability
         of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(b)      Except as to any matter which would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
         neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has failed to
         comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with
         any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental
         Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has
         received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental
         Liability, or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

Subsidiary is in compliance with (a) all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority, and (b) all indentures, agreements or

non-compliance, either singly or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 4.7 Investment Company Act, Etc. Neither the Borrower nor any
of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company", as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (b) a "holding
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or (c) otherwise subject to any other
regulatory scheme limiting its ability to incur debt.

         SECTION 4.8 Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have timely filed
or caused to be filed (or have obtained permitted extensions for) all Federal
income tax returns and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, have filed or caused
to be filed (or have obtained permitted extensions for) all other material tax
returns that are required to be filed by them, and have paid all taxes shown to
be due and payable on such returns or on any assessments made against it or its
property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its
property by any Governmental Authority, except (i) to the extent the failure to
do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) where the same are
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has set aside on its books
adequate reserves.

         SECTION 4.9 Margin Regulations. None of the proceeds of any of the
Loans or Letters of Credit will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any
"margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of such terms under
Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose
that violates the provisions of the applicable Margin Regulations.

         SECTION 4.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most
recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than
$300,000.00 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present
value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Standards No. 87)
did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such
amounts, exceed by more than $300,000.00 the fair market value of the assets of
all such underfunded Plans.

         SECTION 4.11 Ownership of Property.

                  (a)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good
         title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of its real and personal
         property material to the operation of its business.

                  (b)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
         licensed, or otherwise has the right, to use, all material patents,
         trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights and other
         intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by
         the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of
         any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually
         or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.


<PAGE>
         SECTION 4.12 Disclosure.

                  (a)      The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all
         agreements, instruments, and corporate or other restrictions to which
         the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other
         matters known to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
         None of the reports (including without limitation all reports that the
         Borrower is required to file with the Securities and Exchange
         Commission), financial statements, certificates or other information
         furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
         or any Lender in connection with the negotiation or syndication of this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or
         thereunder (as modified or supplemented by any other information so
         furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state
         any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, taken as a
         whole, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading.

                  (b)      The financial projections and other pro forma
         financial information contained in the information referred to in
         subsection (a) above were based on good faith estimates and assumptions
         believed by the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made and at the
         time furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, it being
         recognized by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that such
         projections and other pro forma financial information as to future
         events may differ from the actual results for such period or periods.

         SECTION 4.13 Labor Relations. There are no strikes, lockouts or other
labor disputes or grievances against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or, to the Borrower's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no unfair labor practice, charges or grievances are
pending against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Borrower's
knowledge, threatened against any of them before any Governmental Authority,
which individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse
Effect. All payments due from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement have been paid or
accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary,
except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.14 Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.14 sets forth the name of, the
ownership interest of the Borrower in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of, and
the type of, each Subsidiary and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
Loan Party, in each case as of the Closing Date.

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         The Borrower covenants and agrees that so long as any Lender has a

any LC Disbursement remains unpaid or any Letter of Credit remains outstanding:

         explanation and without any qualification or exception as to scope of
         such audit) to the effect that such financial statements present fairly

         operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for such fiscal year on
         a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP and that the examination
         by such accountants in connection with such consolidated financial
         statements has been made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
         standards;

in this Section shall prohibit any merger, consolidation, liquidation or
dissolution permitted under Section 7.3.

         SECTION 5.4 Compliance with Laws, Etc. The Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and

         SECTION 5.5 Payment of Obligations. The Borrower will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, pay and discharge at or before maturity, all of its
obligations and liabilities (including without limitation all tax liabilities
and claims that could result in a statutory Lien) before the same shall become

being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the Borrower or
such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect

exercise any discretionary powers, except those discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 10.2), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 10.2) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice
thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and
the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements, or other terms and conditions set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere in any Loan
Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 9.3 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Each of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the Lenders, and the
Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, continue to make its own decisions
in taking or not taking of any action under or based on this Agreement, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         SECTION 9.4 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any action or actions (including the failure to act) in connection
with this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
such act or taking such act, unless and until it shall have received
instructions from such Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall not incur
liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent



<PAGE>
acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions
of the Required Lenders where required by the terms of this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.5 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or
made by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent may also rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

         SECTION 9.6 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. The
bank serving as the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement and any other Loan Document in its capacity as a Lender as
any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though
it were not the Administrative Agent; and the terms "Lenders", "Required
Lenders", "holders of Notes", or any similar terms shall, unless the context
clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. The bank acting as the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower as if
it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

         SECTION 9.7 Successor Administrative Agent.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
         giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
         resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
         successor Administrative Agent, subject to the approval by the Borrower
         provided that no Default or Event of Default shall exist at such time.
         If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed, and
         shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
         Administrative Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring
         Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
         Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
         commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
         America or any state thereof or a bank which maintains an office in the
         United States, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
         $500,000,000.

                  (b)      Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the
         Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
         Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
         all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
         Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
         discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents. If within 45 days after written notice is given
         of the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation under this Section
         9.7 no successor Administrative Agent shall have been appointed and
         shall have accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day (i) the
         retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall become effective,
         (ii) the retiring Administrative Agent shall thereupon be discharged
         from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents, and


<PAGE>

         (iii) the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the
         retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents until such time
         as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
         provided above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
         hereunder, the provisions of this Article IX shall continue in effect
         for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent and its
         representatives and agents in respect of any actions taken or not taken
         by any of them while it was serving as the Administrative Agent.

         communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all
         notices and other communications to any party herein to be effective
         shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices
         and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
         hereto. All such notices and other communications shall, when
         transmitted by overnight delivery, or faxed, be effective when
         delivered for overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted in legible
         form by facsimile machine, respectively, or if mailed, upon the third
         Business Day after the date deposited into the mails or if delivered,
         upon delivery; provided that notices delivered to the Administrative
         Agent, or the Issuing Bank shall not be effective until actually
         received by such Person at its address specified in this Section 10.1.

                  (b)      Any agreement of the Administrative Agent and the
         Lenders herein to receive certain notices by telephone or facsimile is
         solely for the convenience and at the request of the Borrower. The
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on the
         authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the
         Borrower to give such notice and the Administrative Agent and Lenders
         shall not have any liability to the Borrower or other Person on account
         of any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent or the
         Lenders in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The
         obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans and all other Obligations
         hereunder shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any
         failure of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to receive written
         confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by
         the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of a confirmation which is at
         variance with the terms understood by the Administrative Agent and the
         Lenders to be contained in any such telephonic or facsimile notice.

         SECTION 10.2 Waiver; Amendments.

                  (a)      No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the
         Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
         or any other Loan Document, and no course of dealing between the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender, shall operate as a
         waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
         right or power or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
         such right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
         the exercise of any other right or power hereunder or thereunder. The
         rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and
         the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
         and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. No
         waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
         consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event
         be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of
         this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
         in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the
         issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of
         any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the
         Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had
         notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.

                  (b)      No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
         Agreement or the other Loan Documents, nor consent to any departure by
         the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same
         shall be in writing and signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders
         or the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the



<PAGE>

         Required Lenders and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
         only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
         given; provided that no amendment or waiver shall: (i) increase the
         Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,
         (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or
         reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable
         hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
         (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of any principal of, or
         interest on, any Loan or LC Disbursement or interest thereon or any
         fees hereunder or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
         payment, or postpone the scheduled date for the termination or
         reduction of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
         affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(c) in a manner that would
         alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby , without the
         written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of
         this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other
         provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders which
         are required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
         determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the consent of
         each Lender; (vi) release any guarantor or limit the liability of any
         such guarantor under any guaranty agreement; (vii) release all or
         substantially all collateral (if any) securing any of the Obligations;
         provided further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
         otherwise affect the rights, duties or obligations of the
         Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Bank without the prior written
         consent of such Person.

         SECTION 10.3 Expenses; Indemnification.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable,
         out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent, including
         the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the
         Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
         facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of
         the Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers thereof
         (whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or any
         other Loan Document shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable
         out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with
         the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
         or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees,
         charges and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of
         inside counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing
         Bank in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
         connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
         Section, or in connection with the Loans made or any Letters of Credit
         issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred
         during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
         Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (b)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
         Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any
         of the foregoing (each, an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each of them
         harmless from, any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages
         and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of
         any counsel for any Indemnitee, which may be reasonably incurred by or
         asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or
         as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
         other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the


<PAGE>

         performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
         hereunder or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
         hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or any actual or proposed use
         of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to
         honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
         presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with
         the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged
         presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
         owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Environmental Liability
         related in any way to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or (iv) any actual
         or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating
         to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
         theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
         provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any
         Indemnitee for any of the foregoing arising out of such Indemnitee's
         gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
         competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall pay, and hold the Administrative
         Agent and each of the Lenders harmless from and against, any and all
         present and future stamp, documentary, indebtedness taxes, and other
         similar taxes incurred with respect to perfecting its and their Liens
         in and against the Collateral.

                  (d)      To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any
         amount required to be paid to the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing
         Bank under clauses (a), (b) or (c) hereof, each Lender severally agrees
         to pay to the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Bank, as the case
         may be, such Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that
         the unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
         amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified payment,
         claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was
         incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Bank in its capacity as such.

                  (e)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
         Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any
         Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
         consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to actual or direct
         damages) arising out of, in connection with or as a result of, this
         Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
         transactions contemplated therein, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or
         the use of proceeds thereof.

                  (f)      All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
         promptly after written demand therefor.

         SECTION 10.4 Successors and Assigns.

                  (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
         upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
         assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder without the prior
         written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or
         transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
         assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and the Loans and LC Exposure at the time owing to it);
         provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a
         Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure,
         the Issuing Bank) must give their prior written consent (which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case
         of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
         assignment of the entire amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
         hereunder or an assignment while an Event of Default has occurred and
         is continuing, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
         subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
         Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
         to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000.00
         (unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise
         consent), (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
         of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) the
         assigning Lender and the assignee shall execute and deliver to the
         Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
         processing and recordation fee payable by the assigning Lender or the
         assignee (as determined between such Persons) in an amount equal to
         $3,500 and (v) such assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver a
         duly completed Administrative Questionnaire to the Administrative
         Agent; provided that any consent of the Borrower otherwise required
         hereunder shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and
         is continuing. Upon the execution and delivery of the Assignment and
         Acceptance and payment by such assignee to the assigning Lender of an
         amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such Persons, such
         assignee shall become a party to this Agreement and any other Loan
         Documents to which such assigning Lender is a party and, to the extent
         of such interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have
         the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
         assigning Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a
         corresponding extent (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
         covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
         this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
         continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16
         and 10.3. Upon the consummation of any such assignment hereunder, the
         assigning Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make
         appropriate arrangements to have new Notes issued if so requested by
         either or both the assigning Lender or the assignee. Any assignment or
         other transfer by a Lender that does not fully comply with the terms of
         this clause (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
         sale of a participation pursuant to clause (c) below.

                  (c)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of
         the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Bank, sell
         participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant")
         in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Loans
         owing to it and its LC Exposure); provided that (i) such Lender's
         obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
         Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
         the performance of its obligations hereunder, and (iii) the Borrower,
         the


<PAGE>
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents. Any agreement between such Lender and the
         Participant with respect to such participation shall provide that such
         Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the sole right to approve
         any amendment, modification, consent, or waiver regarding this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that such
         participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without
         the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or
         waiver of this Agreement described in the first proviso of Section
         10.2(b) that affects the Participant.

                  (d)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
         security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
         Agreement and its Notes (if any) to secure its obligations to a Federal
         Reserve Bank without complying with this Section; provided that no such
         pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
         hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
         a party hereto.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose
         funding vehicle (an "SPV"), identified as such in writing from time to
         time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the
         Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any
         Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to
         the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing
         herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and
         (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to
         provide all or any part of any Loan, the Granting Lender shall be
         obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of
         a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting
         Lender to the same extent, and as if such Loan were made by such
         Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be
         liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
         Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting
         Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
         agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
         Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after
         the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior
         indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any
         other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy,
         reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
         under the laws of the United States or any State. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.4, any SPV may
         (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing
         fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to
         the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or
         credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding
         or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
         non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency,
         commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit
         or liquidity enhancement to such SPV. As this Section 10.4(e) applies
         to any particular SPV, this Section may not be amended without the
         written consent of such SPV.

         SECTION 10.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
         Process.

                  (a)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
         construed in accordance with and be governed by the law (without giving
         effect to the conflict of law principles thereof) of the State of
         Tennessee.

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         submits, for itself and its property, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
         of the United States District Court of the Middle District of
         Tennessee, and of any state court of the State of Tennessee located in
         Davidson County and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
         or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
         Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or
         for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
         hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
         respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
         such Tennessee state court or, to the extent permitted by applicable
         law, such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
         judgment in any such action or proceeding may be enforced in other
         jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
         by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
         affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
         this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its
         properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c)      The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives
         any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
         of any such suit, action or proceeding described in paragraph (b) of
         this Section and brought in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of
         this Section. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives, to the
         fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an
         inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
         any such court.

                  (d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
         the service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
         10.1. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document will
         affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other
         manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 10.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.


<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.7 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall have the right, at any time or
from time to time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and
apply against all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) of the Borrower at any time held or other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender and the Issuing Bank to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all Obligations held by such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such Lender or the Issuing
Bank shall have made demand hereunder and although such Obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank agree promptly to notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower after any such set-off and any application
made by such Lender and the Issuing Bank, as the case may be; provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

         SECTION 10.8 Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be executed
by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate
counterparts (including by telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreement(s)
relating to any fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto and thereto regarding the subject matters
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral
or written, regarding such subject matters.

         SECTION 10.9 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, and 10.3 and Article
IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 10.10 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the legality,
validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and
the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and each Lender agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions to
maintain the confidentiality of any information designated in writing as
confidential and provided to it by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except that
such information may be disclosed (i) to any Related Party of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Lender, including without limitation
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, (ii) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process,
(iii) to the extent requested by any regulatory agency or authority having
jurisdiction, (iv) to the extent that such information becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, or which becomes
available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Lender or any
Related Party of any of the foregoing on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of rights hereunder, and (ix) subject to provisions substantially
similar to this Section 10.11, to any actual or prospective assignee or
Participant, or (vi) with the consent of the Borrower. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of any information as provided for in this Section
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person
has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
information as such Person would accord its own confidential information.

         SECTION 10.12 Interest and Loan Charges Not to Exceed Maximum Amounts
Allowed by Law. Anything in this Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents or
any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
whatsoever, whether by reason of advancement of proceeds of the Loans,
acceleration of the maturity of the unpaid balance of the Loans or otherwise,
shall the interest and loan charges agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use
of the money advanced or to be advanced hereunder exceed the maximum amounts
collectible under applicable laws in effect from time to time. It is understood
and agreed by the parties that, if for any reason whatsoever the interest or
loan charges paid or contracted to be paid by Borrower in respect of the Loans
shall exceed the maximum amounts collectible under applicable laws in effect
from time to time, then ipso facto, the obligation to pay such interest and/or
loan charges shall be reduced to the maximum amounts collectible under
applicable laws in effect from time to time, and any amounts collected by any
Lender that exceed such maximum amounts shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal balance of the Loans and/or refunded to Borrower so that at no time
shall the interest or loan charges paid or payable in respect of the Loans
exceed the maximum amounts permitted from time to time by applicable law.
