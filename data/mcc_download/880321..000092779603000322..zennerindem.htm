<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Indemnification Agreement (the &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) dated as of April 6, 2001, by
and between Dendrite International Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), and Patrick&nbsp;L. Zenner, a Director of the Company (the

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Indemnitee is presently serving as a director of the Company, and the Company desires
the Indemnitee to continue in such capacity; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Indemnitee is willing, subject to certain conditions (including the execution and
performance of this Agreement by the Company), to continue in that capacity; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in addition to the indemnification to which the Indemnitee is entitled under the
Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation (the &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;), the
Company maintains at its sole expense insurance protecting its officers and directors
(including the Indemnitee) against certain losses arising out of actual or threatened
actions, suits or proceedings to which such persons may be made or threatened to be made
parties; and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
as a result of circumstances having no relation to, and beyond the control of, the Company
and the Indemnitee, there can be no assurance of the continuation or renewal of that
insurance; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, to induce the Indemnitee to continue to serve in his present capacity and in
consideration of these premises and the mutual agreements set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and the Indemnitee agree as follows: </FONT></P>


<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
     &nbsp;<U>Continued  Service</U>. The Indemnitee will continue to serve as a
director  of the  Company  so  long  as he is  duly  elected  and  qualified  in
accordance with the Company&#146;s by-laws (the  &#147;<U>By-Laws</U>&#148;)  or
until  he  resigns  in  writing  in  accordance   with  applicable  law.  &nbsp;
</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
&nbsp;<U>Initial Indemnity</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The
Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee who was or is a party  or is  threatened  to be
made a party  to any  threatened,  pending  or completed   action,   suit  or
 proceeding,   whether   civil,   administrative, investigative  or  criminal  (other
 than an  action  by or in the  right of the Company),  by  reason  of the fact  that he
is or was or had  agreed to become a director  of the  Company,  or is or was  serving
 or had agreed to serve at the request of the Company as a  director,  officer,  trustee,
 employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or by reason of any action  alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against any and all costs, charges and expenses (including  attorneys&#146;  and
others&#146; fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably  incurred by the Indemnitee in connection  therewith and any appeal
 therefrom if the  Indemnitee  acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
 believed  to be in or not  opposed  to  the  best  interests  of the Company,  and,
 with  respect  to any  criminal  action  or  proceeding,  had no reasonable  cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful.  The  termination  of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement,  conviction or upon a plea of nolo  contendre  or its
 equivalent  shall  not,  of  itself,  create  a presumption  that the  Indemnitee  did
not  satisfy  the  foregoing  standard of conduct to the extent applicable thereto.  </FONT></P>

threatened to be made a party to any  threatened,  pending or completed  action, suit or
 proceeding  by or in the right of the  Company to procure a judgment in its  favor by
 reason  of the fact  that he is or was or had  agreed to become a director  of the
 Company,  or is or was  serving  or had agreed to serve at the request of the Company as
a  director,  officer,  trustee,  employee or agent of another  corporation,
 partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other  enterprise against costs, charges and
expenses (including attorneys&#146;  and others&#146;fees and expenses)  actually and
reasonably  incurred by him in connection  with the defense or  settlement  thereof or
any appeal  therefrom if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests  of the Company and except  that no
 indemnification  shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the
Indemnitee shall have been adjudged  to be liable to the  Company  unless and only to the
 extant  that the Superior Court or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the  circumstances  of the case,  the  Indemnitee  is fairly  and
reasonably  entitled to indemnity for such expenses  which the Superior Court or such
other court shall deem proper.  </FONT></P>

prejudice,  in any action,  suit or  proceeding  referred to in Sections 2(a) or 2(b)  or
in  defense  of any  claim,  issue  or  matter  therein,  he  shall  be indemnified
against costs, charges and expenses (including  attorneys&#146;  and others&#146;  fees

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Any
     indemnification  under  Sections  2(a) or 2(b) (unless  ordered by a court) shall be
made by the Company  only as  authorized  in the  specific  case upon a determination  in
accordance  with Section 4 or any applicable  provision of the Certificate,   By-Laws,
  other   agreement,   resolution  or  otherwise.   Such determination  shall be made (i)
by the Board of  Directors  of the Company (the &#147;<U>Board</U>&#148;) by a majority
vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action,  suit or
proceeding,  (ii) if such a quorum of disinterested  directors is not available or so
directs, by independent legal counsel  (designated in the manner  provided below in this
 subsection (d)) in a written  opinion or (iii) by a majority vote of a quorum of the
 stockholders of the   Company   at   a   meeting    duly   called   and   held
   present   (the &#147;<U>Stockholders</U>&#148;).  Independent legal counsel shall be
designated by    vote    of    a    majority     of    the     disinterested
    directors; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,  that if the  Board  is  unable  or
 fails to so designate,  such  designation  shall be made by the  Indemnitee  subject  to
the approval of the Company  (which  approval shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).
Independent  legal  counsel  shall  not be any  person  or firm  who,  under the
applicable standards professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of
interest in representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine
the Indemnitee&#146;s  rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such independent legal counsel and to indemnify  fully
such counsel  against  costs,  charges and expenses  (including attorneys&#146;  and
 others&#146;  fees and expenses)  actually and  reasonably incurred by such  counsel in
 connection  with this  Agreement or the opinion of such counsel pursuant hereto.  </FONT></P>

 Corporation  Act, any policy of insurance  or  otherwise,   but  subject  to  the
 limitations  on  the  maximum permissible  indemnity  which may exist under  applicable
law at the time of any request for indemnity hereunder  determined as contemplated by
Section 3(a), the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any amount which he is
or becomes legally  obligated  to pay  relating to or arising out of any claim made
against him because of any act,  failure to act or neglect or breach of duty,  including
any actual or alleged  error,  misstatement  or misleading  statement,  which he commits,
 suffers,  permits or  acquiesces  in while acting in his capacity as a director  of the
 Company,  or, at the  request of the  Company,  as a director, officer, trustee,
 employee or agent of another corporations partnership,  joint venture, trust or other

 shall not be obligated  under this Section 3(a) to make any payment in  connection  with

the Indemnitee establishes that his acts or omissions (i) were in breach of his duty of
loyalty to the  Company or the  Stockholders,  (ii) were not in good faith or involved a

&nbsp;<U>Certain      Procedures Relating to Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</U>.
(a) Except as otherwise  permitted or required by the Corporation  Act, for purposes of
pursuing his rights to indemnification  under Sections 2(a), 2(b) or 3(a), as the case
may be, the Indemnitee may, but shall not be required to, (i) submit to the Board a sworn
statement of request for indemnification  substantially in the form  of <U>Exhibit  A </U>attached
  hereto  and  made  a  part  hereof  (the &#147;<U>Indemnification  Statement</U>&#148;)
 averring  that he is entitled to indemnification  hereunder;  and (ii) present to the
Company reasonable evidence of all expenses for which payment is requested,  including
appropriate invoices. Submission  of  an  Indemnification  Statement  to  the  Board
 shall  create  a presumption  that the Indemnitee is entitled to  indemnification  under
Sections 2(a),  2(b) or 3(a),  as the case may be, and the Board  shall be deemed to have
determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to such indemnification unless within 30
calendar  days after  submission of the  Indemnification  Statement the Board shall
 determine by vote of a majority of the  directors at a meeting at which a quorum is
present, based upon clear and convincing evidence (sufficient to rebut the foregoing
presumption), and the Indemnitee shall have received notice within such  period in
writing of such  determination,  that the  Indemnitee  is not so entitled to
indemnification,  which notice shall disclose with particularity the evidence in support
of the  Board&#146;s  determination.  The  foregoing  notice shall be signed by the
 director  presiding  as chairman at the meeting at which the  vote  to  deny
 indemnification  was  taken  or,  if  the  action  to  deny indemnification was by
written consent without a meeting,  signed by all persons who participated in the
 determination  and voted to deny  indemnification.  The provisions of this Section 4(a)
are intended to be procedural only and shall not affect the right of the Indemnitee to
indemnification under this Agreement,  and any  determination  by the Board  that the
 Indemnitee  is not  entitled  to the indemnification   and  any  failure  to  make  the
 payments  requested  in  the Indemnification  Statement  shall be subject to  judicial
 review as provided in Section 7.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
 &nbsp;For      purposes  of  determining  whether to  authorize  advancement  of
 expenses pursuant  to Section  2(e),  the  Indemnitee  shall  submit to the Board a
sworn statement of request for  advancement of expenses  substantially  in the form of <U>Exhibit
   B</U>   attached    hereto   and   made   a   part   hereof   (the &#147;<U>Undertaking</U>&#148;),
averring that (i) he has reasonably incurred or will reasonably incur actual expenses in
defending an actual or threatened civil or criminal  action,  suit,  proceeding or claim
and (ii) he undertakes to repay such amount if it shall  ultimately be determined  that
he is not entitled to be indemnified  by the Company under this Agreement or otherwise,
 which  repayment shall be made within 180 days of a written request therefor by the
Company.  For purposes of requesting  advancement  of expenses  pursuant to Section 3(b),
 the Indemnitee  may, but shall not be required  to,  submit an  Undertaking  or such
other form of request,  as he determines to be appropriate (an  &#147;<U>Expense Request</U>&#148;).
 Upon receipt of an Undertaking or Expense  Request,  as the case may be, the Board may
make reasonable  inquiries to determine  whether such expenses  relate to an action,
 suit,  proceeding or claim the subject matter of which  is  of  the  type  for  which
 the   Indemnitee  may  make  a  claim  for indemnification  under this  Agreement.
 Unless the Board  determines  within 10 calendar days after  receipt of such
 Undertaking  or Expense  Request that such expenses  relate to an action,  suit,
 proceeding or claim the subject matter of which  is not of the  type  for  which  the
 Indemnitee  may  make a  claim  for indemnification  under  this  Agreement,  the Board
 shall  authorize  immediate payment of the expenses  stated in the  Undertaking or
Expense  Request,  as the case may be,  whereupon such payments shall  immediately be
made by the Company. No security  shall be required in  connection  with any  Undertaking
 or Expense Request  and any  Undertaking  or  Expense  Request  shall be  accepted
 without reference to the  Indemnitee&#146;s  ability to make repayment.  For purposes of
pursuing his rights to advancement of expenses  hereunder,  the Indemnitee shall present
to the Company reasonable evidence of all expenses for which advancement is requested,
including appropriate invoices.  </FONT></P>

&nbsp;<U>Enforcement</U>.      (a) If a claim for indemnification  made to the Company
pursuant to Section 4 is not paid in full by the  Company  within 30  calendar  days
after a written claim  has  been  received  by the  Company,  the  Indemnitee  may  at

any action brought under Section 6(a), it shall be a defense to a claim for
          indemnification pursuant to Sections 2(a) or 2(b) (other than an action brought
          to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
          of its final disposition where the Undertaking, if any is required, has been
          tendered to the Company) that the Indemnitee has not met the standards of
          conduct which make it permissible under the Corporation Act for the Company to
          indemnify the Indemnitee for the amount claimed, but the burden or proving such
          defense shall be on the Company. Neither the failure of the Company (including
          the Board, independent legal counsel or the Stockholders) to have made a
          determination prior to commencement of such action that indemnification of the
          Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
          standard of conduct set forth in the Corporation Act, nor an actual
          determination by the Company (including the Board, independent legal counsel or
          the Stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
          conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the

     Indemnitee shall not be required to incur the expenses  associated with the
enforcement  of his rights  under this  Agreement by  litigation  or other legal action
because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits
intended to be extended to the Indemnitee  hereunder.  Accordingly,  if the  Company  has
 failed  to  comply  with any of its  obligations  under  this Agreement or if the
Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or
 unenforceable,  or institutes any action,  suit or proceeding designed (or having the
effect of being  designed) to deny,  or to recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits
intended to be provided to the Indemnitee hereunder, the Company  irrevocably  authorizes
 the  Indemnitee  from time to time, at the expense of the Company as hereinafter
provided, to retain counsel (in compliance with Section 7) to represent the Indemnitee in
connection with the initiation or defense of any such  action,  suit,  or  proceeding,
 whether by or against  the Company or any director,  officer,  stockholder or other
person  affiliated with the  Company,  in  any  jurisdiction.  The  Company  shall  pay

the Indemnitee  (i) as a  result  of the  Company&#146;s  failure  to  perform  this
Agreement  or any  provision  hereof or (ii) as a result of the  Company  or any Person
 contesting  the validity or  enforceability,  of this  Agreement or any, provision
hereof as aforesaid.  </FONT></P>

&nbsp;<U>Counsel</U>.      With  respect  to  any  action,   suit,   proceeding  or
 claim  for  which indemnification  or  advancement  of  expenses  may be sought
 pursuant  to this Agreement and upon request of the Indemnitee  after the Indemnitee has
submitted an  Indemnification  Statement to the Board,  the Company  shall retain
 counsel reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee and any
other the Company may  designate  (which may include the Company) in  connection with
 the  action,  suit,  proceeding  or claim  to  which  the  Indemnification Statement
 relates.  In  connection  with any such action,  suit,  proceeding or claim,  the
Indemnitee shall have the right to retain his own counsel at his own expense,  except
 that the fees and  expenses  of such  counsel  retained by the Indemnitee shall be
expenses for which  indemnification and advancement shall be available under this
Agreement if (i) the Company and the Indemnitee  shall have agreed to the  retention of
such counsel or (ii) the parties named or threatened to be named in any such action,
 suit,  proceeding or claim (including impleaded parties)  include,  in addition to the
Indemnitee,  the Company or another party who may be indemnified by the Company and
 representation of more than one party by the same counsel would be  inappropriate  due
to actual or, in the reasonable opinion  of  the  Company,   potential  conflicts  of
 interests  between  them.  </FONT></P>

corporation in a consolidation, merger or other reorganization, the Company, if it shall
not be the  surviving,  resulting  or other  corporation  therein,  shall  require as a
condition thereto the surviving,  resulting or acquiring corporation to agree to
indemnify the Indemnitee to the full extent provided in this Agreement.  Whether or not
the Company is the resulting,  surviving or acquiring  corporation in any such
 transaction,  the  Indemnitee  shall also stand in the same position under this
Agreement with respect to the resulting,  acquiring corporation as he would have with
 respect  to the  Company if its  separate  existence  had  continued.  </FONT></P>

 provided by this Agreement shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which the
Indemnitee may be entitled  under the  Certificate,  By-Laws,  the  Corporation  Act, any
other statute,  insurance  policy,  agreement,  vote of  stockholders  or directors or
otherwise,  both as to actions  in his  official  capacity  and as to actions in another
 capacity  while  holding  such  office,  and shall  continue  after the Indemnitee has
ceased to be a director,  officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall  inure  to  the
 benefit  of  his  heirs,  executors  and  administrators.  </FONT></P>
