3.       The Tenant shall vacate the ground floor Leased Premises and Additional

         Tenant shall have no leasehold interest of any description in or to the
         ground floor of the Building. The Tenant may enter into possession of
         the Third Floor Leased Premises prior to December 16, 2002 provided
         this Sublease Amendment Agreement is fully executed.

4.       The Third Floor Leased Premises are sublet to the Tenant in an "as is"
         condition with no requirement for any additional fit up, alterations,
         provision of furniture or equipment, use of maintenance resources or
         leasehold improvements. There are no inducements offered to the Tenant
         and no free services will be provided in connection with the Tenant's
         occupation of the third floor of the Building. More specifically, the

         with its occupation of the Third Floor Leased Premises and the Tenant
         will be required to purchase or lease, at their sole expense, a phone
         system that meets their requirements.

5.       The common areas defined in the Sublease shall be amended to include
         the toilets and common hallways on the third floor. The second floor is
         not a common area.

6.       GROSS RENT: For greater certainty, Tenant shall pay directly to the
         Landlord all gross rents, prepayments and deposits to be applied to the
