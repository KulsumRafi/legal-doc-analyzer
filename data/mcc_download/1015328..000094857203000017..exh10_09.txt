3.       NOTES EVIDENCING BORROWING.

         The Loans shall be  evidenced by Note 1 executed by the Borrower in the
principal  amount of TWENTY FIVE  MILLION  DOLLARS  ($25,000,000)  and by Note 2
executed  by  Borrower  in  the  principal   amount  of  FIFTY  MILLION  DOLLARS
($50,000,000),  which  Notes  shall be in the form set  forth as  EXHIBIT  A and
EXHIBIT B hereto, respectively.

         (a)  Interest on amounts  outstanding  under the Notes shall be payable
quarterly,  in arrears,  commencing on November 29, 2002, and continuing on each
February 28, May 29,  August 29 and November 29  thereafter.  Interest  shall be
also  payable  at  maturity,  after  maturity  on  demand,  and on the  date any
principal payment hereon is paid.

         (b) A final  payment  of all  outstanding  amounts  due  under  Note 1,

         (c) A final  payment  of all  outstanding  amounts  due  under  Note 2,
including,  but not limited to  principal,  interest and any amounts owing under
Subsection  10(m) of this Agreement,  if not payable  earlier,  shall be due and
payable on May 15, 2003.

         (d) The  amounts  outstanding  under the Notes  from time to time shall
bear interest  calculated on the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a
360 day year,  at a rate  equal,  at the  Borrower's  option,  to either (a) the
London Inter-Bank offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 140 basis points, or (b) the Prime
                                 -----
Rate (whichever rate is so selected, the "Interest Rate").
                                          -------------

         For  purposes of this  Agreement,  the term "Prime Rate" shall mean the
                                                      ----------
floating prime rate in effect from time to time as set by LaSalle,  and referred
to by LaSalle as its Prime Rate. The Borrower  acknowledges  that the Prime Rate
is not  necessarily  LaSalle's  lowest or most favorable rate of interest at any
one time.  The effective date of any change in the Prime Rate shall for purposes
hereof be the date the rate change is publicly announced by LaSalle.

         For purposes of this  Agreement,  "LIBOR" shall mean the per annum rate
                                            -----
of interest at which U.S. dollar deposits in an amount  comparable to the amount
of the  relevant  LIBOR Loan and for a period  equal to the  relevant  "Interest
                                                                        --------
Period"  (hereinafter  defined)  are offered  generally to LaSalle in the London
------
Interbank  Eurodollar market which are published by Bloomberg  Financial Markets
systems (or other comparable nominated vendor of the British Bankers Association
LIBOR Rate) at  approximately  11:30 a.m. (London time) one banking day prior to
the  commencement  of each Interest  Period,  such rate to remain fixed for such
Interest Period.  "Interest Period" shall mean successive three month periods as
selected  from time to time by the  Borrower by notice given to LaSalle not less
than  three  banking  days  prior to the first day of each  respective  interest
Period;  provided  that: (i) each such three month period  occurring  after such
initial  period  shall  commence on the day on which the next  preceding  period
expires;  and (ii) the final  Interest  Period shall be such that its expiration
occurs on or before the stated maturity date hereof. The Borrower hereby further
promises  to pay to the order of  LaSalle,  on

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

demand,  interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof after maturity  (whether
by  acceleration  or otherwise) at a rate of two per cent per annum in excess of
the Prime Rate in effect at the time of maturity.

         LaSalle's determination of LIBOR as provided above shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error. Furthermore,  if LaSalle determines, in good faith (which
determination  shall  be  conclusive,  absent  manifest  error),  prior  to  the
commencement of any Interest Period, that (a) U.S. dollar deposits of sufficient
amount and maturity  for funding any LIBOR Loan are not  available to LaSalle in
the London Interbank  Eurodollar  market in the ordinary course of business,  or
(b) by reason of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Eurodollar market,
adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of interest to be
applicable  to the  relevant  LIBOR  Loan,  LaSalle  shall  promptly  notify the
Borrower  and such LIBOR Loan shall be  immediately  due and payable on the last
banking  day of the then  existing  interest  Period,  without  further  demand,
presentment,  protest or notice of any kind,  all of which are hereby  waived by
the Borrower.

         If, after the date hereof,  the  introduction  of, or any change in any
applicable law, treaty,  rule,  regulation or guideline or in the interpretation
or administration  thereof by any governmental  authority or any central bank or
other fiscal,  monetary or other authority having  jurisdiction  over LaSalle or
its lending office (a "Regulatory Change"),  shall, in the opinion of counsel to
                       -----------------
LaSalle,  makes it  unlawful  for  LaSalle  to make or  maintain  any LIBOR Loan
evidenced hereby, then LaSalle shall promptly notify the Borrower and such LIBOR
Loan shall be  immediately  due and payable on the last  banking day of the then
existing Interest Period or on such earlier date as required by law, all without
further  demand,  presentment,  protest or notice of any kind,  all of which are
hereby waived by the Borrower.

         If, for any  reason,  any LIBOR Loan is paid prior to the last  banking
day of its  then-current  interest  Period,  the  Borrower  agrees to  indemnify
LaSalle  against  any loss  (including  any loss on  redeployment  of the  funds
repaid), cost or expense incurred by LaSalle as a result of such prepayment.

         If any Regulatory Change (whether or not having the force of law) shall
(a) impose, modify or deem applicable any assessment,  reserve,  special deposit
or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account
of or loans by, or any other  acquisition of funds or disbursements by, LaSalle;
(b) subject LaSalle or any LIBOR Loan to any tax, duty, charge, stamp tax or fee
or change the basis of taxation of payments to LaSalle of  principal or interest
due from the Borrower to LaSalle  hereunder (other than a change in the taxation
of the  overall  net income of  LaSalle);  or (c)  impose on  LaSalle  any other
condition  regarding such LIBOR Loan or LaSalle's  funding thereof,  and LaSalle
shall determine (which determination shall he conclusive, absent manifest error)
that the result of the foregoing is to increase the cost to LaSalle of making or
maintaining  such LIBOR Loan or to reduce the amount of  principal  or  interest
received  by LaSalle  hereunder,  then the  Borrower  shall pay to  LaSalle,  on
demand,  such additional amounts as LaSalle shall, from time to time,  determine
are  sufficient to compensate  and indemnify  LaSalle for such increased cost or
reduced amount.

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

         (e) Any amount of  principal  or interest on the Note which is not paid
when due,  whether at stated  maturity,  by acceleration or otherwise shall bear
interest payable on demand at an interest rate equal at all times to two percent
(2%) above the Prime Rate.

         (f) Each Loan shall be made  available to the Borrower upon its written
or  verbal  request,  from any  person  whose  authority  to so act has not been
revoked by the Borrower in writing previously received by LaSalle.  Such request
must be received by no later than 11:00 a.m. Chicago,  Illinois time, on the day
it is to be funded.  The  proceeds of each Loan shall be made  available  at the
office of LaSalle by credit to the  account of the  Borrower  or by other  means
requested by the Borrower and  acceptable  to LaSalle.  LaSalle is authorized to
rely on the  telephonic,  telecopy or  telegraphic  loan requests  which LaSalle
believes  in its good  faith  judgment  to emanate  from a  properly  authorized
representative  of the  Borrower,  whether or not that is in fact the case.  The
Borrower does hereby irrevocably  confirm,  ratify and approve all such advances
by LaSalle  and does  hereby  indemnify  LaSalle  against  losses  and  expenses
(including court costs,  attorneys' and paralegals' fees) and shall hold LaSalle
harmless with respect thereto.

         (g) If any payment to be made by the  Borrower  hereunder  shall become
due on a  Saturday,  Sunday  or bank  holiday  under  the  laws of the  State of
Illinois,  such payment  shall be made on the next  succeeding  business day and
such extension of time shall be included in computing any interest in respect of
such payment.

4.       PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS.

         (a) Borrower hereby agrees that LaSalle shall have the exclusive right,
in its sole  discretion to determine the  application  of all payments  received
from the Borrower.  Unless  LaSalle elects  otherwise,  LaSalle shall apply such
payments in the following order; (i) expenses under the Agreement;  (ii) accrued
interest under Note 2; (iii) accrued  interest under any  subordinated  notes or
debentures  issued by the Borrower and owned by LaSalle;  (iv) accrued  interest
under Note 1; (v) principal  amounts  outstanding  under Note 2; (vi)  principal
amounts  outstanding under any subordinated note or debenture issued by Borrower
and  owned  by  LaSalle;  (vii)  principal  amounts  outstanding  under  Note 1;
provided,   however,   subject  to  certain  applicable  rules,  regulations  or
limitations  which govern the repayment of  subordinated  indebtedness by a bank
holding  company  subsequent  to an event of default,  LaSalle is  authorized to
apply any payments it receives in such order, combination and amount as LaSalle,
in its sole and absolute  discretion,  may determine.

         (b)  Prepayments  of Prime Rate Loans are  permitted  at any time,  and
shall be applied to the next succeeding  principal  payment due. Any prepayments
of LIBOR Loans shall be subject to the terms of Section 3(d), above.

5.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         To induce  LaSalle to make the Loan  provided for herein,  the Borrower
represents and warrants as follows:

         (a) The  Borrower:  (i) is a  corporation  duly  organized  and validly
existing and in good standing  under the laws of the State of Illinois;  (ii) is
duly qualified as a foreign

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>

corporation  and is in good standing in all states in which it is doing business
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material  adverse effect
on the  Borrower  or its  business,  and  (iii)  has  all  requisite  power  and
authority,  corporate or otherwise, to own, operate and lease its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted.  Each Subsidiary is an Illinois
banking  corporation or a national  banking  association,  and has all requisite
power and  authority,  corporate  or  otherwise,  to own,  operate and lease its
property and to carry on its business as now being  conducted.  The Borrower and
the  Subsidiaries  have made payment of all  franchise  and similar taxes in the
State of Illinois and in all of the respective  jurisdictions  in which they are
incorporated or qualified, insofar as such taxes are due and payable at the date
of this  Agreement,  except  for any such taxes the  validity  of which is being
contested in good faith and for which proper reserves have been set aside on the
books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be.

         (b) The  Borrower  is the owner of 100% of the issued  and  outstanding
capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries.

         (c) The Subsidiary stock has been duly authorized,  legally and validly
issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable,  and is owned by the  Borrower  free and
clear of all pledges liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances, except,
upon  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  herein,  for the security
interest  granted by the Borrower to LaSalle.  There are, as of the date hereof,
no outstanding options, rights or warrants obligating Borrower to issue, deliver
or sell,  or cause to be issued,  delivered  or sold,  additional  shares of the
capital stock of any Subsidiary or obligating Borrower to grant, extend or enter
into any such agreement or commitment, except for such agreements or commitments
existing as of the date of this Agreement and disclosed to LaSalle.

         (d) The financial statements of:

                  (i) the Borrower,  all of which have heretofore been furnished
         to LaSalle,  have been prepared in accordance  with generally  accepted
         accounting  principles  consistently applied ("GAAP") and maintained by
                                                        ----
         the Borrower  throughout the periods  involved,  and fairly present the
         financial condition of the Borrower  individually and on a consolidated
         basis at such dates specified therein and the results of its operations
         for the periods then ended; and

                  (ii)  each  Subsidiary,  all of  which  have  heretofore  been
         furnished to LaSalle,  to the best  knowledge of the Borrower have been
         prepared in  accordance  with GAAP and  maintained  by such  Subsidiary
         throughout  the periods  involved,  and fairly  present  the  financial
         condition of such  Subsidiary at such dates  specified  therein and the
         results of its operations for the periods then entered.

         (e) To the best knowledge of the Borrower, since the latest date of the
financial  statements  referred  to in Section  5(d)  above,  there have been no
material  changes  in  the  assets,  liabilities,  or  condition,  financial  or
otherwise,  of the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  other than changes  arising from
transactions in the ordinary  course of business,  and no such changes have been
materially adverse,  whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. To
the best  knowledge of the Borrower,  neither the business nor the properties of
the Borrower or any

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

Subsidiary  have been materially and adversely  affected in any way,  including,
without  limitation,  as a result  of any  fire,  explosion,  accident,  strike,
lockout,  labor dispute,  flood,  drought,  embargo,  imposition of governmental
restrictions, confiscation by a governmental agency or acts of God.

         (f) There are no  actions,  suits,  proceedings  or written  agreements
pending,  nor to the  best  of the  knowledge  of  the  Borrower  threatened  or
proposed,  against the Borrower or, to the best  knowledge of the Borrower,  any
Subsidiary, at law or in equity or before or by any federal, state, municipal or
other governmental department, commission, board or other administrative agency,
domestic or foreign,  which are of a material  nature.  Neither of the  Borrower
nor, to the best  knowledge of the Borrower,  any  Subsidiary is in default with
respect to any order,  writ,  injunction or decree of, or any written  agreement
with, any court, commission, board or agency, domestic or foreign.

         (g) all tax  returns  and  reports  of the  Borrower  and,  to the best
knowledge of the  Borrower,  each  Subsidiary,  required by law to be filed have
been duly filed, and all taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges
upon the Borrower and the Subsidiaries or upon any of their properties or assets
which  are due  and  payable  have  been  paid,  and the  Borrower  knows  of no
additional  assessment  of  a  material  nature  against  the  Borrower  or  the
Subsidiaries  for taxes,  or,  except as disclosed on the  financial  statements
referred  to in  Section  5(d)  above,  of any  basis  for any  such  additional
assessment.

         (h) The  Borrower's  primary  business is that of a  financial  holding
company.  All necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained for the Borrower
to conduct its business.

         (i) The deposit accounts of the Subsidiaries are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").
                                ----

         (j) None of the Pledged security  constitutes  margin stock, as defined
in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system ("FRS").
                                                                          ---

         The foregoing  representations  and warranties shall survive the making
of this  Agreement,  and  execution  and  delivery  of the Notes and the  Pledge
Agreement,  and shall be deemed to be continuing  representations and warranties
until such time as the Borrower has satisfied all of its obligations to LaSalle;
including,  but not  limited  to the  obligation  to pay in full all  principal,
interest and other amounts in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement,  the
Notes and the Pledge Agreement.

6.       NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         The  Borrower  agrees  that  until the  Borrower  satisfies  all of its
obligations to LaSalle,  including, but not limited to its obligations to pay in
full all  principal,  interest and other amounts  owing in  accordance  with the
terms of this Agreement,  the Notes and the Pledge Agreement, the Borrower shall
not, nor shall the Borrower cause, permit or allow any Subsidiary to:

         (a) create,  assume,  incur, have outstanding,  or in any manner become

the  Subsidiaries,  on a consolidated  basis, to be not more than twenty percent

charge  upon the  property  of the  Borrower  or the  Subsidiaries.  Neither the
Borrower nor the Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment,
charge or claim,  so long as the  validity  thereof  shall be  contested in good
faith by appropriate  proceedings,  and reserves therefor shall be maintained on
the  books of the  Borrower  or any such  Subsidiary  as are  deemed  reasonably
adequate by LaSalle;

owners of similar  businesses  and  properties in the same general area in which
the Borrower or such Subsidiary  respectively operate, and such additional bonds
and insurance as may be reasonably required by LaSalle;

         (k) permit and cause the  Subsidiaries to permit  LaSalle,  through its
employees,  attorneys,  accountants  or  other  agents,  to  inspect  any of the
properties,  corporate books and financial books and records of the Borrower and
