absence of footnote disclosures.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.4(a) shall cease
to be effective upon the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering, provided

long as such Person meets the requirements set forth in the first sentence of
this Section 5.4(a), the information specified in Sections 5.4(a)(i) and

the provisions hereof, to such Person's officers, directors, employees,
attorneys and affiliates, to such Person's financial or other professional
advisors who agree in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof, and as may
be necessary or appropriate to comply with any subpoena or other legal process
or to enforce or protect such

Company in communications with its funding sources, potential funding sources or
as may be reasonably necessary to raise capital for future funds.

Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 5.4(a), Antares Capital
Corporation shall be entitled to all rights set forth in this Section 5.4(a)
(regardless of its ownership of Class A Common and/or Senior Common so long as
it holds any Class A Common) at any time that Antares Capital Corporation or any
of its Affiliates is not entitled to receive financial statements and similar
information from Brickman Ltd. pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement or any

express terms would restrict the Company's right or ability to perform the
provisions of this Agreement, the Registration Agreement, the Stockholders

It is understood and agreed that if at any time neither of the two Approval
Right Conditions is satisfied, this Section 5.4(b) shall forthwith terminate and
be null and void and of no further force and effect.

               (c) Right to Sell and Right to Purchase CIVC Group Shares.

                    (i) Right to Sell Class A Common. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, both (A) in each of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 at any time
from April 1 through and including May 31 of such year (the "Exercise Period"),
and (B) at any time during the Exercise Period in each of the 2 calendar years
commencing after the Forced Sale Expiration Date, CIVC (or, if there is a
Designated Class A Transferee, then such Designated Class A Transferee) may, by
written notice to the Company (a "CIVC Put Notice"), elect to have the CIVC
Group and any Class A Transferee sell to the Company (and the Company, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, shall purchase), at the CIVC Repurchase
Price specified in Section 5.4(c)(iv) below, all but not less than all of the
shares of Class A Common and Underlying Common then owned by the CIVC Group and
any Class L Transferee (the "Put"), provided that the CIVC Group and each Class
L Transferee of the CIVC Group hereby further agrees to deliver a Put Notice (as
defined in the Class L Common Purchase Agreement) with respect to all of the
Senior Common the CIVC Group and any Class L Transferee then holds (if any)
pursuant to Section 3G(i) of the Class L Purchase Agreement simultaneously with
the delivery of the CIVC Put Notice hereunder. The closing for the sale of the
Class A Common and Underlying Common referred to in this Section 5.4(c)(i) (the
"CIVC Put Closing") shall take place at the

                                       39

<PAGE>

offices of the Company at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date (A) not more than 180
days after the date the CIVC Repurchase Price has been determined in accordance
with subparagraph (iv) below, as selected by the Company, or (B) at such other
time or place as the Company and CIVC (or the Designated Class A Transferee) may
agree upon (the "CIVC Put Closing Date"). Each purchase and sale of securities
by the Company and any member of the CIVC Group (or any Class A Transferee) at
any CIVC Put Closing shall constitute a separate purchase and sale hereunder.
The failure of any holder of securities to be acquired at a CIVC Put Closing to
comply with its obligations under this Section 5.4(c) shall have no effect on
the rights and obligations of the other parties hereto to consummate such CIVC
Put Closing, but the non-complying party shall not have any further rights under
this Section 5.4(c) or otherwise to cause the Company to purchase such holder's
Class A Common. At the CIVC Put Closing, each member of the CIVC Group and each
Class A Transferee shall deliver certificates representing all the shares of
Class A Common (accompanied by duly executed stock powers with signatures
guaranteed and other appropriate documentation of authority to transfer) to be
purchased by the Company against payment of the CIVC Repurchase Price by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Each member of the CIVC Group and each
Class A Transferee will deliver such shares free and clear of all liens, claims
and encumbrances (other than any encumbrances arising under this Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement). The Company promptly (but in any event within 5
business days) shall notify each member of the CIVC Group and each Class A
Transferee upon receipt of a Brickman Put Notice.

                    (ii) Right to Purchase Class A Common. Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, (A) from April 1 through and including May 31 of each
year commencing in 2009 or (B) after the fifth anniversary hereof, in the event
that the Company requests that CIVC (or the Designated Class A Transferee)
approve a transaction under Sections 5.4(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) hereof and
CIVC (or the Designated Class A Transferee) fails to approve such transaction
within 30 days after such request at any time within 60 days after such request,
the Company may, by written notice to each member of the CIVC Group and each
Class A Transferee (the "CIVC Call Notice"), elect to purchase, or have any
designee of the Company purchase, from the members of the CIVC Group and the
Class A Transferees (and each member of the CIVC Group and each Class A
Transferee hereby agrees to sell), at the CIVC Repurchase Price, all but not
less than all of the shares of Class A Common and Underlying Common as are then
owned by the CIVC Group and the Class A Transferees; provided that the Company
hereby further agrees to deliver a Call Notice (as defined in the Class L Common
Purchase Agreement) with respect to all of the Senior Common the CIVC Group and
the Class L Transferees then hold (if any) pursuant to Section 3G(ii) of the
Class L Purchase Agreement simultaneously with the delivery of the CIVC Call
Notice hereunder. At the Company's option, the Company may provide in a CIVC
Call Notice that the Company will purchase any Class A Common issued upon
conversion, on or prior to the Call Closing Date, of Class L Common pursuant to
subparagraph (vi) of Section 3G of the Class L Purchase Agreement, and in such
case any such shares of Class A Common shall be subject to the Company's
repurchase rights under this Section 5.4(c). The closing for the purchase of the
shares of Class A Common and Underlying Common referred to in this Section
5.4(c)(ii) (the "CIVC Call Closing") shall take place at the offices of the
Company at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date (A) not more than 180 days after the
date the CIVC Repurchase Price has been determined in accordance with
subparagraph (iv) below, as selected by the Company, or (B) at such other time
or place as the Company and CIVC (or the Designated Class A Transferee) may
agree upon (the "CIVC Call Closing Date"). Each

                                       40

<PAGE>

purchase and sale of securities by the Company and the CIVC Group (or any Class
A Transferee) at any CIVC Call Closing shall constitute a separate purchase and
sale hereunder. The failure of any holder of securities to be acquired at a CIVC
Call Closing to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.4(c) shall have
no effect on the rights and obligations of the other parties hereto to
consummate such CIVC Call Closing, but any non-complying party shall not have
any further rights under this Section 5.4(c) or otherwise to cause the Company
to purchase such holder's Class A Common. At the CIVC Call Closing, each member
of the CIVC Group and each Class A Transferee will deliver certificates
representing all the shares of Class A Common (accompanied by duly executed
stock powers with signatures guaranteed and other appropriate documentation of
authority to transfer) to be purchased by the Company against payment of the
CIVC Repurchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Each
member of the CIVC Group and each Class A Transferee will deliver such shares
free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances (other than any
encumbrances arising under this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement).

                    (iii) Payment Subject to Applicable Law and Compliance with
Debt Instruments. It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to
pay any portion of the CIVC Repurchase Price at any CIVC Put Closing (i) that
the Company have funds legally available therefor and (ii) with respect to any
CIVC Put Closing to take place prior to December 21, 2009, that such payment not
violate, breach or conflict with, or cause any default under (or constitute any
event that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute such a
default), the Senior Credit Agreement and the Indenture and/or any refinancings
or replacements thereof (each a "Company Debt Instrument"), it being understood
that after December 20, 2009, clause (ii) above shall not be applicable. In the
event that the Company does not have funds legally available to pay any portion
of the CIVC Repurchase Price, or, with respect to any CIVC Put Closing to take
place prior to December 21, 2009, if payment of any portion of the CIVC
Repurchase Price would violate, breach or conflict with, or cause any default
under (or constitute any event that, with notice or the passage of time, or
both, would constitute such a default), a Company Debt Instrument, then
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4(c)(i) above or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the CIVC Put Closing Date shall be deferred
until such time as the Company shall have funds legally available therefor and,
until December 20, 2009, such payment would not violate, breach or conflict
with, or cause any default under (or constitute any event that, with notice or
the passage of time, would constitute such a default), a Company Debt
Instrument; provided, however, that to the extent the CIVC Repurchase Price is
not paid to the CIVC Group and the Class A Transferees in full in cash within
180 days after the date the CIVC Repurchase Price is determined, such portion of
the CIVC Repurchase Price as has not then been paid at such time will thereafter
bear interest at a per annum rate of 12% until such portion is paid in full in
cash to the CIVC Group and the Class A Transferees. In addition, (i) until the
CIVC Repurchase Price is paid in full in cash, the CIVC Group and each Class A
Transferee will retain all of the rights of a stockholder, including its rights
under this Agreement (including approval of specified actions and information
and inspection rights), the Stockholders Agreement (including Board
representation on the terms set forth in Section 1 of the Stockholders
Agreement), the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and applicable
law, as if it continued to own the number of shares of Class A Common and
Underlying Common that the unpaid portion of the CIVC Repurchase Price
represents, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (v) below, to
the extent necessary to consummate the CIVC Put Closing or the CIVC Call
Closing, the Company shall

                                       41

<PAGE>

use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) amend the Company Debt
Instruments in a manner that will permit payment of the CIVC Repurchase Price or
(y) raise the funds necessary to pay the CIVC Repurchase Price through either a
debt or an equity offering (it being understood that CIVC and any Class A
Transferee of any member of the CIVC Group will cooperate with any such
undertaking, including by providing any necessary consents or approvals under
this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, applicable law or otherwise to
any such debt or equity offering closing in connection with the CIVC Put
Closing, provided that the terms of such debt or equity offering shall not
adversely affect the Company's payment of the CIVC Repurchase Price hereunder).
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (v) below, if the CIVC Repurchase
Price is not paid in full in cash on or prior to the earlier of the date 180
days after the date the CIVC Repurchase Price is determined and 270 days after
the CIVC Put Notice is delivered (the "Closing Deadline Date"), the CIVC Group
and the Class A Transferees shall have the following rights (the "Forced Sale
Rights"):

                         (A) Sale Transaction. CIVC (or the Designated Class A
Transferee) shall have the right (but not the obligation) to cause a Sale of the
Company. In such event, the Company and each of its stockholders, including each
of the parties to this Agreement and their respective assignees and transferees
(the "Other Stockholders"), hereby agree to take all actions and execute all
instruments as may be necessary or as may be reasonably requested by CIVC (or
the Designated Class A Transferee) to (a) enable CIVC (or the Designated Class A
Transferee) to retain (at the Company's expense) a nationally recognized
investment banker after consultation with the Brickman Representatives (provided
that if such investment banker is affiliated with any member of the CIVC Group
or the Designated Class A Transferee, the Company shall have the right to
consent to the fees of such investment banker (in the case of any such
investment banker, other than any investment banker affiliated with Bank of
America, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or denied)) to assist in
such Sale of the Company, (b) enable the investment banker to conduct an auction
in an orderly process to maximize equityholder value and (c) cause the Company
and/or the Other Stockholders to take any of the following actions or any
combination thereof: (i) selling up to all of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' assets in one or more transactions; (ii) merging or consolidating
the Company or Brickman Ltd. with or into any other Person; and/or (iii)
requiring that each Other Stockholder to sell up to all of the Company's capital
stock then held by such Other Stockholder or causing the Company to sell all
equity securities of Brickman Ltd. held by it.

                         (1) Drag-Along Rights. In order to effectuate the
     foregoing, when the CIVC Group has the Forced Sale Rights, each Other
     Stockholder hereby agrees to vote for, consent to and raise no objections
     against such Sale of the Company. If the Sale of the Company is structured
     as a merger or consolidation, each holder of Common Stock shall waive any
     dissenters' rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with
     such merger or consolidation, or if the Sale of the Company is structured
     as a sale of the Company's securities or equity securities of Brickman
     Ltd., each holder of such securities shall agree to sell up to all of such
     equity securities and rights to acquire such equity securities on the terms
     and conditions so approved and to deliver to the purchaser(s) the
     certificates representing the equity securities to be sold. Each Other
     Stockholder hereby agrees to take all necessary or desirable actions in
     connection with the consummation of the Sale of the Company as requested by
     CIVC. In furtherance of the foregoing, CIVC (or the Designated Class A
     Transferee) shall have the

                                       42

<PAGE>

     rights of the Brickman Representatives set forth in paragraph 10 of the
     Stockholders Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
     the Other Stockholders pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the
     satisfaction of the following conditions: upon consummation of the Sale of
     the Company undertaken under this subparagraph, (i) the proceeds thereof
     available to the stockholders of the Company shall be distributed among the
     Company's stockholders as if there were a liquidation and dissolution of
     the Company, (ii) all holders of a class and series of Common Stock
     (including all Class A Common, taken together as a single class) shall
     receive in respect of shares of such class the same form and amount of
     consideration per share (including for this purpose amounts allocated to
     noncompetition, consulting and other similar arrangements other than
     commercially reasonable employment arrangements for employees with respect
     to their continuing employment and other than amounts payable to, and
     retainable by, Scott W. Brickman for any non-compete covenants in an
     aggregate amount of 250% of Scott W. Brickman's annual base salary in
     effect at the time of such Sale of the Company for each year such
     non-compete covenant remains effective) and the proportion of cash and
     other consideration payable to each class and series of Common Stock shall
     be identical, (iii) if the holders of any class of Common Stock are given
     an option as to the form and consideration to be received (including all
     Class A Common, taken together as a single class), all holders of such
     class shall be given the same option, (iv) no Other Stockholder shall be
     required to share in any indemnification obligations other than
     individually and ratably (and not jointly and severally), pro rata with the
     Other Stockholders in accordance with each such Other Stockholder's
     ownership of Stockholder Shares (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement),
     provided that no Other Stockholder shall be required to share in any
     indemnification obligations relating to a breach of a representation or
     warranty relating solely to another Other Stockholder or such Other
     Stockholder's Stockholder Shares such as with respect to title to
     Stockholder Shares or authorization to enter into transaction agreements
     (such obligations to be borne solely by the other Other Stockholder), and
     (v) no Other Stockholder shall be required to share in any indemnification
     obligations in excess of the net proceeds payable to such Other Stockholder
     in such Sale of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to
     the contrary herein, in the event CIVC or the Designated Class A Transferee
     has Forced Sale Rights, it will be a condition to any obligation of the
     Brickmans or their Permitted Transferees under this Section 5.4(c)(iii)(A)
     that upon a Sale of the Company (i) the Brickmans and their Permitted
     Transferees receive cash or Liquid Securities (for the purpose substituting
     "Brickmans and their Permitted Transferees" for "CIVC Group" in the
     definition of Liquid Securities), (ii) the Brickmans and their Permitted
     Transferees are offered the same form and value of consideration as the
     CIVC Group (or, in the event the CIVC Group is offered illiquid securities,
     the Brickmans and their Permitted Transferees are offered cash or other
     Liquid Securities of the same value (ignoring any discount for illiquidity)
     as the illiquid securities offered to the CIVC Group and (iii) the
     Brickmans and their Permitted Transferees are able to transfer all of their
     capital stock of the Company then held by the Brickmans and their Permitted
     Transferees.

                         (2) Board Rights. The director(s) elected by the
     holders of Class A-1 Common pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation
     shall have the voting rights specified in subparagraph 1C(iii) of
     subdivision B of the Certificate of Incorporation (and the holders of the
     Class A-1 Common shall have the right to elect one

                                       43

<PAGE>

     Class A-1 Director (as defined therein), if no Class A-1 Director is then
     serving). If for any reason the provisions of paragraph 1C of subdivision B
     of Article IV of the Certificate of Incorporation do not provide the voting
     rights intended by the parties, the Company shall make alternative
     arrangements to provide the CIVC Group or the Designated Class A Transferee
     with the benefits of such voting rights.

                    (iv) Repurchase Price. The "CIVC Repurchase Price" for any
shares sold or purchased under this Section 5.4(c) shall be based on the Company
Equity Value, which shall be derived from the Company Enterprise Value,
determined in the manner as set forth below. For a period of 15 days after the
date of any CIVC Put Notice or CIVC Call Notice, each of CIVC or the Designated
Class A Transferee and the Company agrees to negotiate in good faith to
determine the Company Enterprise Value. In the event such parties reach
agreement, such agreed value shall be the Company Enterprise Value. In the event
the parties are unable to agree within such 15 day period, the Company shall
retain a nationally recognized investment bank or appraisal firm (a "Bank") to
determine the Company Enterprise Value (based on standard appraisal
methodologies) and such determination shall be furnished to CIVC or the
Designated Class A Transferee within 20 days after the end of such 15 day
negotiation period; provided that if the determination of Company Enterprise
Value by such Bank will be in the form of a range, then the Bank shall be
instructed that the higher of such values shall not be more than 110% of the
lower of such values (the "First Bank Range"). If CIVC or the Designated Class A
Transferee fails to object in writing to such appraisal within 15 days after its
receipt thereof, the mid-point of the First Bank Range shall be the Company
Enterprise Value. If CIVC or the Designated Class A Transferee objects in
writing to such appraisal, then CIVC or the Designated Class A Transferee shall
retain a Bank to determine the Company Enterprise Value as described above and
to furnish such determination to the Company within 20 days after such
objection; provided that if the determination of Company Enterprise Value by
such Bank will be in the form of a range, then the Bank shall be instructed that
the higher of such values shall not be more than 110% of the lower of such
values (the "Second Bank Range"). The Company Enterprise Value shall be the
average of the higher mid-point and the lower mid-point; provided, however, that
if the mid-point of the Second Bank Range is more than 110% of the mid-point of
the First Bank Range, then the Company shall retain a third Bank reasonably
acceptable to CIVC or the Designated Class A Transferee (the "Third Bank") to
determine the Company Enterprise Value as described above, within 20 days after
the retention of such Third Bank, and the Company Enterprise Value shall be the
average of the mid-points of the two Bank determinations, the mid-points of
which are closest to one another. All fees and expenses of and other liabilities
to each Bank shall be paid by the party retaining such Bank, except that such
fees, expenses and liabilities with respect to the Third Bank shall be borne by
the party who retained the Bank whose determination is not used to calculate the
Company Enterprise Value, provided that any expenses attributable to CIVC under
this sentence shall be borne by the CIVC Group out of the proceeds paid at the
CIVC Put Closing or the CIVC Call Closing, as the case may be. The Company
Equity Value shall be determined by the Company and CIVC or the Designated Class
A Transferee from the Company Enterprise Value in accordance with the terms
hereof. The CIVC Repurchase Price paid under this Section 5.4(c) shall be that
amount that would be distributed in respect of such Class A Common and
Underlying Common upon a hypothetical liquidation of the Company where the
proceeds available for distribution to all holders of Common Stock or other
equity of the Company in such liquidation are equal to the Company Equity Value.
In the event that a CIVC Put Closing or CIVC Call Closing has not

                                       44

<PAGE>

occurred within 180 days after the initial determination of the CIVC Repurchase
Price hereunder (the "Repricing Date"), then (1) the Company and CIVC or the
Designated Class A Transferee shall make another determination of the CIVC
Repurchase Price in accordance with this clause (iv), with all applicable time
periods set forth in this clause (iv) with respect to the price determination
beginning on the Repricing Date, and (2) the holders of securities subject to
repricing under this sentence shall be entitled to receive at the CIVC Call
Closing or CIVC Put Closing the greater of (x) the initial CIVC Repurchase Price
plus any accrued but unpaid interest pursuant to subparagraph (iii) above from
and including the Repricing Date through and including the date on which such
initial CIVC Repurchase Price is paid in full in cash or (y) the CIVC Repurchase
Price determined after the Repricing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a Sale of the Company occurs at any time (whether prior to or after
the Repricing Date) after the delivery of a CIVC Put Notice or CIVC Call Notice,
as the case may be, but before or contemporaneous with the payment of the CIVC
Repurchase Price in full in cash, each member of the CIVC Group (or any Class A
Transferee) shall receive the amount per share to which they entitled pursuant
to such Sale of the Company, rather than the CIVC Repurchase Price. From the
date of the delivery of a CIVC Put Notice or CIVC Call Notice, as the case may
be, through the CIVC Put Closing Date or the CIVC Call Closing Date, as the case
may be, the Company shall operate its business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.

                    (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the
contrary herein, the Company or the Brickman Representatives shall have the
right, at any time prior to the Closing Deadline Date, to deliver a notice (a
"Sale Notice") to the members of the CIVC Group and the Class A Transferees
notifying such holders that the Company or the Brickman Representatives have
determined to seek a Sale of the Company, in which event the Company or the
Brickman Representatives shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect
such Sale of the Company. In the event a Sale Notice is delivered, for the next
succeeding 180 days (A) the Company will be under no obligation to pay any
portion of the CIVC Repurchase Price at the CIVC Put Closing, (B) neither CIVC
nor any other party will have Forced Sale Rights, including the rights set forth
in subparagraph (iii)(A) above, (C) the Company will not be under any obligation
to seek to amend any Company Debt Instrument or raise debt or equity funds under
clause (ii) of subparagraph (iv) above and (D) paragraphs 10(a), 10(c) and 10(d)
of the Stockholders Agreement would apply to such Sale of the Company (it being
understood, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Sale Notice is
delivered and both a Permitted Sale of the Company has not been consummated
within 180 days after delivery of the Sale Notice (the "Brickman Sale Deadline
Date") and the CIVC Repurchase Price has not been paid by the Brickman Sale
Deadline Date, CIVC (or the Designated Class A Transferee) will have the Forced
Sale Rights set forth in subparagraph (iii) above).

                    (vi) In the event of a Tag-Put (as defined in the Family
Stockholders Agreement), the Company (i) shall not be permitted to consummate
the Tag-Put with any Brickman Put Holder unless it simultaneously consummates
the Put or call contemplated by the CIVC Put Notice or CIVC Call Notice to which
it relates and (ii) shall not be permitted to consummate the Put or call with
any member of the CIVC Group or any Class A Transferee unless it simultaneously
consummates the corresponding Tag-Put with all Brickman Put Holders
participating in the Tag-Put.

                                       45

<PAGE>

                    (vii) In the event that a Sale of the Company is consummated
within 270 days after (i) any CIVC Call Closing Date, (ii) any CIVC Put Closing
Date that occurs after a Sale Notice has been delivered or (iii) any CIVC Put
Closing Date, if a Sale of the Company is consummated with any Person or
affiliates of any Person that made an offer in writing to the Company to acquire
the Company prior to the CIVC Put Closing Date, the Company promptly (but in any
event within three (3) business days of the closing of such Sale of the Company)
shall pay each member of the CIVC Group and each Class A Transferee in
immediately available funds to an account designated by each such Person the
excess, if any, of (A) the consideration such member of the CIVC Group or Class
A Transferee would have received in such Sale of the Company in respect of the
shares of Class A Common repurchased by the Company on the CIVC Call Closing
Date had they been held by the member of the CIVC Group or Class A Transferee as
of the closing of the Sale of the Company over (B) the CIVC Repurchase Price
received in respect of such shares of Class A Common.

                    (viii) The Forced Sale Rights of the CIVC Group and the
Class A Transferees with respect to a Put exercise shall expire on the 181st day
after the Put Default Date (the "Forced Sale Expiration Date").

                    (ix) The provisions of this Section 5.4(c) shall terminate
upon the earlier of (a) the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering of any
equity securities of the Company, (b) a Permitted Sale of the Company or (c)
with respect to any particular share of Class A Common or Underlying Common, a
Public Sale thereof.

               (d) Compliance with Agreements. The Company shall perform and
observe (i) all of its obligations to each holder of the Common Stock as set
forth in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, and (ii) all of
its obligations to each holder of Registrable Securities set forth in the
Registration Agreement.

               (e) Current Public Information. At all times after the Company
has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the requirements of either the Securities Act or the Securities
Exchange Act, the Company shall file all reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.

               (f) Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filing. Upon any conversion from time
to time of any shares of Class A Non-Voting Common held by members of the CIVC
Group into shares of Class A Voting Common that requires a notification or other
filing under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), or any other antitrust laws, the Company shall: (i)
promptly take all actions necessary to make the filings required of it or any of
its Affiliates under the HSR Act and/or such other antitrust laws and, if
requested by the members of the CIVC Group for which such filing is necessary,
request early termination of the waiting period thereunder; (ii) comply
reasonably promptly with any request for additional information or documentary
material received by it or any of its Affiliates from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice; (iii) take
such other reasonable steps as may be appropriate to cooperate with the CIVC
Group in attempting to resolve any government investigation or other inquiry
commenced by any governmental authority, including by making available such
Company information and involving such Company personnel as may be useful in
that effort; (iv) cooperate with the CIVC Group in the

                                       46

<PAGE>

defense of any court action or other legal proceeding brought by any
governmental authority to restrict or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including all reasonable avenues of
administrative or judicial appeal or any adverse judgment, injunction, or other
order; (v) pay the fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of the Company
arising out any governmental filing requirements, investigations or inquiries;
and (vi) pay the fees and expenses of each member of the CIVC Group and their
Affiliates arising out of any governmental filing requirements, investigations,
or inquiries, including (a) all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses for attorneys and consultants) in an amount not to
exceed $50,000 in the aggregate and (b) HSR Act filing fees for one filing under
the HSR Act, it being understood that the fees and expenses of the members of
the CIVC Group and their Affiliates from a second or any subsequent filings
shall not be paid by the Company. The Company and the CIVC Group shall each
promptly inform the other of any material communication made to, or received by
such party from, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any
other authority regarding any of the transaction contemplated hereby or such
conversion of the Class A Non-Voting Common. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of the Company under this Section 5.4(f) shall terminate on a
prospective basis with respect to any member of the CIVC Group at such time as
the Company exercises its rights to repurchase such party's shares of Class A
Non-Voting Stock pursuant to Article IV, Subdivision B, Section 3B of the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation.

               (g) Financial Information. From and after the Closing Date, the
Company will hold all of the books and records of Brickman Ltd. existing on the
Closing Date and not destroy or dispose of any thereof for a period of ten years
from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by law, and
thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose of such books and records, will
offer first in writing at least 60 days prior to such destruction or disposition
to surrender them to CIVC (so long as it holds any Class A Common) or the
Brickman Representatives (so long as they hold any Class A Common).

               (h) Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. The
Company shall, and from and after the Closing Date shall cause Brickman Ltd. to,
indemnify and hold the past and existing directors and officers of the Company
and Brickman Ltd. harmless from and against, to the maximum extent permitted
under applicable law, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or
actions or proceedings with respect to any thereof) or expenses (including, but
not limited to, all legal expenses and any and all other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action
or proceeding, commenced or threatened by any third party, whether or not such
officer or director is a formal party thereto) to which, jointly or severally,
any such officer or director may be subject, which arise out of or are based
upon such officer's or director's service or status as an officer or director of
Brickman Ltd. prior to the Closing Date, for a period of six years after the
Closing Date; provided, that such period of indemnification shall be extended
for the duration of any and all actions or proceedings with respect to any claim
for indemnification made prior to the expiration of such six-year period;
provided further, such indemnification will only be provided in accordance with
(i) the Company's and Brickman Ltd.'s bylaws as in effect on the date hereof and
(ii) applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. The Company
shall, and from and after the Closing Date shall cause Brickman Ltd. to,
maintain existing policies of liability insurance covering the directors and
officers of the Company and Brickman Ltd. for periods prior to the Closing Date
("Covered Persons") or replace such policies with policies with scope

                                       47

<PAGE>

of coverage, policy limits, retention amounts, and other material terms that are
no less favorable to such Covered Persons than those of the policies currently
in effect; provided that such insurance is then available on commercially
reasonable terms.

               (i) Class L Common Board Observer Right. CIVC hereby agrees it
shall not exercise the right of the holders of the Class L Common pursuant to
the Certificate of Incorporation to designate an observer to attend meetings of
the Company's Board of Directors so long as it and the CIVC Group hold a
majority of the Senior Common.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                OTHER AGREEMENTS

          6.1 Certain Understandings.

               (a) Each of the parties is sophisticated and was advised by
experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in
connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that (i)
there are no representations or warranties by or on behalf of any party hereto
or any of its respective affiliates or representatives other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) the parties' respective rights
and obligations with respect to this Agreement and the events giving rise
thereto will be solely as set forth in this Agreement and the other agreements
referred to herein. None of the Stockholders, the Company, Brickman Ltd. or any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability to CIVC, the Brickman
Investors or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Company,
CIVC or any of the Stockholders, or the Company's, CIVC's or any of the
Stockholders' use of, any information not contained in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any offering memorandum, brochure or other
publication provided to the Company, CIVC or any of the Stockholders, and any
other document or information provided to the Company, CIVC or any of the
Stockholders in connection with the sale of the Brickman Shares and the issuance
of the Class A Common). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Brickman Ltd. makes no representation, warranty or covenant of any
kind with respect to any projections, estimates or budgets heretofore delivered
to or made available to the Company or any of the Stockholders of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of Brickman Ltd. or the future business and operations of
Brickman Ltd.

          6.2 Waiver, Release and Discharge. Except as specifically provided in
Section 6.7 hereof, the Selling Stockholders and the Rollover Investors
participating in the Rollover Investor Repurchase hereby acknowledge that the
delivery of such Stockholder's respective portion of the Selling Stockholder
Purchase Price or the Rollover Investor Purchase Price, respectively,
constitutes payment in full for the Brickman Shares delivered to Brickman Ltd.
in connection with the Selling Stockholder Repurchase and the Rollover Investor
Repurchase, as applicable. Except as specifically provided in Section 6.7
hereof, effective upon the Closing, each Selling Stockholder hereby irrevocably
waives, releases and discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective officers, directors, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, accountants
and attorneys) from any and all Liabilities to such Selling Stockholder of any
kind or nature whatsoever, whether in his or her capacity as a Selling
Stockholder hereunder, as a securityholder, officer, director or manager of the

in respect of rights of contribution or indemnification),

in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known
or unknown, and whether arising hereunder or under any other agreement or
understanding or otherwise at law or equity, and each Selling Stockholder shall
not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors,
Affiliates, stockholders, agents, accountants and attorneys. In no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors,
Affiliates, stockholders, agents, accountants and attorneys have any liability
from and after the Closing to any of the Selling Stockholders whatsoever for any
breaches of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of the
Company or Brickman Ltd. hereunder, and none of the Selling Stockholders shall
in any event seek contribution from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, stockholders, agents,
accountants and attorneys for any breaches of the representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants of the Company or Brickman Ltd. contained in this
Agreement or in respect of any other payments required to be made by this

limiting any of the foregoing, upon delivery by Brickman Ltd. to the Selling

releases and discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries (including Brickman
Ltd.) (and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, stockholders,
agents, accountants and attorneys) (i) from all right or title to, or interest
in, any Brickman Shares or any capital stock or equity securities of the Company
or Brickman Ltd. or options, warrants, rights, contracts, calls, puts, rights to
subscribe, conversion rights or other agreements or commitments providing for
the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any of the Company's or Brickman
Ltd.'s capital stock or other equity securities which such Selling Stockholder
may have as of the Closing Date (after consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), and such Selling Stockholder explicitly agrees to the
immediate termination and forfeiture, as of the Closing Date (after consummation

rights to acquire any Brickman Shares or any capital stock or equity securities
of the Company (whether or not earned or exercisable), and (ii) from any and all
Liabilities to such Selling Stockholder as the result of, in connection with,
relating to or incidental to or by virtue of any claim by such Selling
Stockholder that such Selling Stockholder, as of the Closing Date (after
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), owns or has any right or
title to, or interest in, any Brickman Shares or any capital stock or equity
securities of the Company or options, warrants, rights, Contracts, calls, puts,
rights to subscribe, conversion rights or other agreements or commitments
providing for the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any of the Company's

          6.3 Transfer of Restricted Securities.

               (a) General Provisions. In addition to any requirements set forth
in the Stockholders Agreement, Restricted Securities are transferable only
pursuant to (i) public offerings registered under the Securities Act, (ii) Rule
144 or Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any similar rule
or rules then in force) if such rule is available and (iii) subject to the
conditions specified in this Section 6.3, any other legally available means of
transfer.

               (b) Opinion Delivery. In connection with the transfer of any
Restricted Securities (other than a transfer described in paragraph 6.3(a)(i) or
(ii) above), the

                                       49

<PAGE>

holder thereof shall deliver written notice to the Company describing in
reasonable detail the transfer or proposed transfer, together, if reasonably
requested by the Company, with an opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, Dechert or other
counsel which (to the Company's reasonable satisfaction) is knowledgeable in
securities law matters to the effect that such transfer of Restricted Securities
may be effected without registration of such Restricted Securities under the
Securities Act. In addition, if the holder of the Restricted Securities delivers
to the Company an opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, Dechert or such other counsel
that no subsequent transfer of such Restricted Securities shall require
registration under the Securities Act, the Company shall promptly upon such
contemplated transfer deliver new certificates for such Restricted Securities
which do not bear the Securities Act legend set forth in Section 6.3(c) below.
If the Company is not required to deliver new certificates for such Restricted
Securities not bearing such legend, the holder thereof shall not transfer the
same until the prospective transferee has confirmed to the Company in writing
its agreement to be bound by the conditions contained in this Section 6.3.

               (c) Legend. Each certificate or instrument representing
Restricted Securities shall be imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following form:

          "The securities represented by this certificate were originally issued
          on December 20, 2002 and have not been registered under the Securities
          Act of 1933, as amended. The transfer of the securities represented by
          this certificate is subject to the conditions specified in the
          Recapitalization Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date (as defined
          therein), and as amended and modified from time to time, between the
          issuer (the "Company") and certain investors, and the Company reserves
          the right to refuse the transfer of such securities until such
          conditions have been fulfilled with respect to such transfer. A copy
          of such conditions shall be furnished by the Company to the holder
          hereof upon written request and without charge."

               (d) Rule 144A. Upon the request of a holder of Restricted
Securities, the Company shall promptly supply to such holder or its prospective
transferees all information regarding the Company required to be delivered in
connection with a transfer pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

               (e) Legend Removal. If any Restricted Securities become eligible
for sale pursuant to Rule 144(k), the Company shall, upon the request of the
holder of such Restricted Securities, remove the legend set forth in Section
6.3(c) from the certificates for such Restricted Securities.

          6.4 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by
either party hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          6.5 Brickman Representatives. Each Brickman Investor hereby
irrevocably appoints both Theodore W. Brickman, Jr. and Scott W. Brickman (the
"Brickman

                                       50

<PAGE>

Representatives") as such Brickman Investor's representatives, attorneys-in-fact
and agents, with full power of -substitution to act in the name, place and stead
of such Brickman Investor with respect to the transfer of such Brickman
Investor's Shares to the Company in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and to act on behalf of such Brickman Investor in any amendment
of or litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement and to do or refrain
from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all such documents,
as such Brickman Representatives shall deem necessary or appropriate in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the power:

               (a) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with
the waiver of any condition to the obligations of Brickman Investors to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

               (b) to bring and transact matters of litigation and to refer
matters to arbitration and to compromise and settle any claim on behalf of any
Brickman Investor;

               (c) to receive or hold the certificates evidencing the shares of
Class A Common to be purchased by the Brickman Investors hereunder and to
deliver the Brickman Shares to be contributed by the Brickman Investors
hereunder, accompanied by executed stock powers, signature guarantees, and any
other documents relating thereto on behalf of the Brickman Investors;

               (d) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings,
amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it
being understood that each of the Brickman Investors shall executive and deliver
any such documents which each of the Brickman Representatives agrees to
execute);

               (e) to receive funds and give receipt for funds including in
respect of the Rollover Investor Purchase Price payable in respect of Brickman
Shares held by the Brickman Investors, and any adjustment thereto, to distribute
to the Brickman Investors their portion of the Rollover Investor Purchase Price,
and any adjustment thereto, and to withhold from such funds a contingency
reserve for the matters referred to below;

               (f) to terminate this Agreement if Brickman Investors are
entitled to do so;

               (g) to give and receive all notices and communications to be
given or received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement, including service of process in
connection with arbitration; and

               (h) to take all actions which under this -Agreement may be taken
by the Brickman Representatives and to do or refrain from doing any further act
or deed on behalf of such Brickman Investor which the Brickman Representatives
deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as such Brickman Investor could
do if personally present.

                                       51

<PAGE>

          It is understood and agreed by Brickman Investors that any of the
foregoing actions listed in Sections 6.5(a) through 6.5(h) shall require the
approval of both of the Brickman Representatives in order to legally bind any of
the Brickman Investors or otherwise be effective under this Section 6.5.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if either Theodore W. Brickman, Jr. or
Scott W. Brickman dies or otherwise becomes incapacitated and unable to serve as
a Brickman Representative, the other party shall become the sole Brickman
Representative and individually shall have full power and authority granted to
the Brickman Representatives in this Agreement. The death or incapacity of any
Brickman Investor shall not terminate the agency and powers of attorney granted
hereby to the Brickman Representatives. The appointment of the Brickman
Representatives shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and the Company, Brickman Ltd., CIVC and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Brickman Representatives, as the action of Brickman Investors in all matters
referred to herein. All actions, decisions and instructions of the Brickman
Representatives shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Brickman
Investors and no Brickman Investor shall have any cause of action against the
Brickman Representatives for any action taken or not taken by the Brickman
Representatives in his role as such, except for any action or omission taken or
made fraudulently or in bad faith with respect to such Brickman Investor.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, it is understood that the appointment of,
and delegation of authority to, the Brickman Representatives is exclusive, such
that none of the Brickman Investors other than the Brickman Representatives may
take any action or make any decision within the scope of the preceding authority
granted to the Brickman Representatives.

          Except as otherwise provided for in Section 7.5, all reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees payable to counsel and other
professional and brokerage fees) incurred by the Brickman Representatives in
connection with performing such function and in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and all payments, damages, costs, fees and expenses in
connection with any claim by or other dispute with the Company under the
Agreement shall be paid by Brickman Investors in proportion to their respective
interests in the Brickman Shares and may be deducted by the Brickman
Representatives from any amounts otherwise payable to any Brickman Investor
hereunder. The Brickman Representatives may withhold from funds received on
behalf of Brickman Investors prior to distribution of such funds to Brickman
Investors any amount which the Brickman Representatives deems necessary as a
reserve for any such fees, expenses and claims.

          6.6 Termination of Existing Agreements. The Stockholders and Brickman
Ltd. agree that, effective upon Closing, the following agreements shall
terminate and shall have no further force and effect and each party shall have
no further rights, duties, liabilities or obligations to any other party under
such agreements: (i) the Stockholders Agreement dated as of January 14, 1998, by
and among the Company and the stockholders party thereto (as amended and
restated from time to time, the "Existing Stockholders Agreement"), (ii) the
Registration Agreement dated as of January 14, 1998, by and among the Company
and the stockholders party thereto (the "Existing Registration Agreement"),
(iii) the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November 25, 1997, as amended, by
and among The Brickman Group Ltd., Brickman Acquisition Corp., Continental
Illinois Venture Corporation and First Chicago Equity Corporation (the "Existing
Opco Purchase Agreement") and (iv) the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of
January 14, 1998, by and among Brickman Holdings Corp. and the Purchasers listed
on the schedules thereto (the "Existing Holdco Purchase Agreement"). Without
limiting the

                                       52

<PAGE>

generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders who were party to the Existing
Stockholders Agreement (the "Original Stockholders") hereby waive all of their
rights under the Existing Stockholders Agreement with respect to the transfer or
issuance of any Brickman Shares in the Transactions, including all rights to
notice of the transfer or issuance of such shares. In consideration of such
waiver, the Company has provided the Original Stockholders with the opportunity
to invest in Class A Common pursuant to and on the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.

          6.7 Contingent Payment.

               (a) Top Up. If on or before three years after the Closing Date,
there is a Change of Control of the Company at a purchase price which implies an
enterprise value of the Company and its Subsidiaries of more than $395,000,000
(a "Top Up Event"), the Company or Brickman Ltd. shall, at the time of such
Change of Control, pay to each of the OEP Entities and Baraboo, Inc., an amount
equal to the Applicable Percentage of such OEP Entity's or Baraboo, Inc.'s
respective Allocable Share of Profit (if any) from such Change of Control (the
"Top-Up Amount"). The Top-Up Amount shall be paid in cash; provided that if the
Allocable Share of Profit was received in a combination of cash and other
property, such amount shall be paid in a combination of cash and other property
in the same proportion as such cash and other property were originally received
by the Company.

               (b) Definitions.

               "Allocable Share of Profit" in connection with a Change of
Control shall mean the excess of the amount (if any) that would have been
payable with respect to the Brickman Class A Common held by each OEP Entity and
Baraboo, Inc. immediately prior to the Closing (after paying all fees and
expenses actually payable from the proceeds of such Change of Control
transaction triggering the Top Up Event and after repaying all Indebtedness
actually then outstanding) had the transactions not occurred but instead the
entire Company been sold in the Change of Control transaction triggering the Top
Up Event at the time of the Top Up Event, but assuming that such Brickman Shares
(with the terms, rights and preferences such Brickman Shares have as of the date
hereof) had remained held by the Stockholders during the period from immediately
prior to Closing through the date of the Top Up Event, over the amounts actually
paid therefor in the Selling Stockholder Repurchase.

               "Applicable Percentage" shall mean the percentage set forth below
opposite the time period during which the Change of Control occurred:

         Time During Which
     Change of Control Occurred        Applicable Percentage
------------------------------------   ---------------------
During the first year after Closing             20%
During the second year after Closing            10%
During the third year after Closing              5%

               "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of one or more of
the following events: (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Section 3(a) (9)
and 13(d) (3) of the

                                       53

<PAGE>

Exchange Act), together with its affiliates and associates (as such terms are
defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (other than the
Original Investors), becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is defined in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the total
voting power, value or economic interest of the common stock (or equivalent
units) of the Company or Brickman Ltd. or (ii) any person, together with its
affiliates and associates (other than the Original Investors), have the power,
by contract or otherwise, to elect or designate for election a majority of the
board of directors or other governing body of the Company or Brickman Ltd. or
(iii) a sale or transfer (including by operation of law, such as in a merger) by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of all or substantially all of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to an entity which is
not an affiliate of the Company prior to such sale or transfer.

               "Original Investors" shall mean the CIVC Group, the Brickman
Investors and each other Rollover Investor, the Management Holders and their
respective Permitted Transferees.

               (c) Anti-Abuse. The Company shall not take any action or
structure any transaction with the principal intent to evade or avoid the
provision of this Section.

               (d) Determination of Fair Market Value. In the event of a dispute
regarding the fair market value of property received in any transaction, such
dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized independent investment
banking firm mutually acceptable to the OEP Entities and the Company. If the
Company and the OEP Entities cannot agree upon an investment banking firm within
thirty (30) calendar days after a dispute with respect to fair market value
arises, each shall retain, at their own cost and expense, an investment banking
firm and such firms together shall select a third investment banking firm who
shall resolve all disputes between the parties related to fair market value. The
fees and expenses of such third investment banking firm shall be shared equally
by the Company on the one hand and the Stockholders who claim entitlement to a
Top-Up Amount on the other hand.

               (e) This Section 6.7 shall terminate immediately after the
payment of the Top-Up Amount pursuant to this Section 6.7.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          7.1 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights hereunder shall not be
assignable (other than in connection with a Sale of the Company) or transferable
by the Company or Brickman Ltd. without the prior written consent of CIVC (or
the Designated Class A Transferee) and the Brickman Representatives. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon and enforceable
against, the successors and permitted assigns of the respective parties hereto.
Prior to the Closing, CIVC may assign its right and obligation to acquire Class
A Common hereunder in whole or in part to any Person that is not a direct
competitor of Brickman Ltd., and, subject to the provisions hereof and of the
Stockholders Agreement with respect to transfers of the Class A Common, at any
time after the Closing CIVC and the other members of the CIVC Group may assign
their respective rights hereunder in whole or in part to any transferee of the
Class A Common acquired hereunder (it being understood and agreed that any such
transferee shall be subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder and

                                       54

<PAGE>

it shall be a condition to any such transfer that the transferee sign a joinder
to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (a "Transferee
Joinder Agreement") whereby such transferee acknowledges such obligations);
provided, however, that CIVC's rights pursuant to Section 5.4(b) may not be
assigned except pursuant to a Valid Assignment (in which case CIVC shall not
have the rights under Section 5.4(b) that explicitly reference CIVC and the
Designated Class A Transferee, and only such Designated Class A Transferee will
have such rights); provided further that CIVC's right to approve actions
contained in Sections 5.4(b)(ix) and (xiv) may not be assigned in any event;
provided further that, upon any such Valid Assignment of the approval rights in
Section 5.4(b), the numbers "$5,000,000" and "$15,000,000" in Section 5.4(b)(i)
shall thereafter be "$20,000,000" and "$40,000,000," respectively, the number
"1%" in Section 5.4(b)(vi) shall thereafter be "2%" and the number "$200,000" in
Section 5.4(b)(x) shall thereafter be "$2,000,000." For the avoidance of doubt,
it is understood and agreed that, in the event of any transfer or assignment by
any member of the CIVC Group of any shares of Class A Common (or any subsequent
transfer by any such transferee), the transferee(s) or assignee(s) shall
continue to have, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4(c) the rights set
forth in Section 5.4(c)(i), in the event CIVC or the Designated Class A
Transferee so elects, to require that the Company purchase, and the Company or
its designee shall continue to have the rights set forth in Section 5.4(c)(ii)
to purchase, the shares so transferred on the terms set forth in Section 5.4(c)
notwithstanding that such shares are no longer held by a member of the CIVC
Group. Nothing in this Section 7.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
to, nor shall it, limit any obligation of CIVC or any member of the CIVC Group
to comply with the applicable provisions of the Stockholders Agreement in making
any transfer of shares. Any Class L Transferee (as defined in the Class L
Purchase Agreement) that is not otherwise a party to this Agreement may execute
a Transferee Joinder Agreement and become a party to this Agreement with respect
to such transferee's Underlying Common, whereupon such transferee shall become a
Class A Transferee hereunder. A "Valid Assignment" means an assignment of the
rights of CIVC under Section 5.4(b) occurring in connection with a transfer or
series of transfers by members of the CIVC Group to a Person or a group (as such
term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) of affiliated Persons of a number of shares of Class A Common acquired
under this Agreement and Underlying Common acquired under the Class L Purchase
Agreement that is at least equal to 60% of the number of shares of Class A
Common and Underlying Common held by the CIVC Group on the date hereof (as
appropriately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and
similar events), where such rights are assigned to the Person (or group of
affiliated Persons) (the "Designated Class A Transferee," it being understood
that if such transfer is to a group of affiliated Persons, the Designated Class
A Transferee shall be the Person controlling such group) to whom such number of
shares is transferred. Solely for purposes of Section 5.4(c), if there is not a
Designated Class A Transferee pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
then the Designated Class A Transferee shall be deemed to refer to the holder or
holders of a majority of the then outstanding Class A Common and Underlying
Common purchased by the CIVC Group on the date hereof. Any assignee's or
transferee's rights hereunder shall be subject in all respects to the terms
hereof. For example, an assignee of rights hereunder who does not hold shares of
Class A Common and Senior Common with an original cost of $5,000,000 as of the
Closing would not have any rights under Section 5.4(a) hereof.

          7.2 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
5.4(h), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and nothing

                                       55

<PAGE>

herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any person or
entity, other than the parties hereto and such assigns, any legal or equitable
rights hereunder.

          7.3 Termination.

               (a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing by written
notice given by any of Brickman Ltd., CIVC, the Brickman Representatives or the
OEP Entities (each, a "Termination Party" and collectively, the "Termination
Parties") to each other Termination Party, (i) if the Closing shall not have
occurred by January 31, 2003, other than as a result of a default by the party
seeking to terminate, or (ii) if (x) the purchase and sale of the Brickman
Shares or the Class A Common contemplated hereby shall violate any
non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any court or governmental body
having competent jurisdiction or (y) there shall be a statute, rule or
regulation which makes the purchase and sale of the Brickman Shares or the Class
A Common contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited.

               (b) In the event of termination by any Termination Party pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.3, written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to all other Termination Parties and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by such Termination
Parties. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as
provided herein:

                    (i) the provisions of Sections 7.5, 7.7, 7.9, 7.10, 7.11,
7.14 and 7.15 hereof shall remain in full force and effect; and

                    (ii) in no event shall any termination of this Agreement
limit or restrict the rights and remedies of any party hereto against any other
party which has willfully breached any of the agreements or other provisions of
this Agreement prior to termination hereof.

          7.4 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the parties in or
pursuant to this Agreement or any certificates delivered pursuant to Article III
of this Agreement shall not survive and shall expire upon the occurrence of the
Closing and there shall be no liability on the part of any party for breaches
prior to the Closing of any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, except that the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 5.4 and
Articles I, II, VI and VII hereof shall survive the Closing.

          7.5 Transaction Expenses. Whether or not the Transactions are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or
expenses, except as may otherwise be expressly provided in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Brickman Ltd. (or the Company at the Closing, if
it occurs) shall pay all fees and expenses of the Company, Brickman Ltd., the
Brickman Investors, CIVC, Continental Illinois Venture Corporation, the OEP
Entities and each of their respective affiliates, representatives, attorneys and
advisors in connection with (i) negotiating and the Closing of the Transactions
and the transactions contemplated by the other agreements referred to herein (it
being understood that one counsel is being retained by CIVC and Continental
Illinois Venture Corporation and one counsel is being retained by the Brickman
Investors as a group), (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of CIVC and the
Brickman

                                       56

with respect to the Company which mentions such Person; provided that any fees

Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall be payable only in accordance with Section 5.4(f).

          7.6 Amendments. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement
shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by (a) prior to
Closing, each of Brickman Ltd., CIVC, the Brickman Representatives and the OEP

Representatives.

party shall be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of
any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term of this Agreement. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

posting a bond or other security) in the event of any breach of this Agreement.

          7.16 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
