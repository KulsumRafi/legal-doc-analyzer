         AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT  AGREEMENT dated as of October 21, 2002,
among ANTEON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (as the successor
by merger to the  Borrower  under the  Existing  Credit  Agreement  (as  defined
below), the "Borrower"),  ANTEON CORPORATION,  a Virginia corporation  ("Anteon"
and, together with the Borrower,  the  "Borrowers"),  the Lenders (as defined in
Article I),  CREDIT  SUISSE FIRST  BOSTON,  a bank  organized  under the laws of
Switzerland,  acting through its Cayman Islands branch, as issuing bank (in such
capacity,  the "Issuing Bank"),  and as administrative  agent (in such capacity,
the "Administrative  Agent") for the Lenders,  and CITIZENS BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA
("Citizens  Bank"),  as  swingline  lender  (in such  capacity,  the  "Swingline
Lender"), and as collateral agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent") for
the Lenders.

         The  Borrower,   the  Existing   Lenders  (such  term  and  each  other
capitalized  term used but not defined  herein  having the  meaning  given it in
Article I), the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and
the Collateral  Agent are parties to the Existing Credit  Agreement,  whereunder
(a) the Existing  Lenders  extended credit and/or agreed to extend credit in the
form of (i) Tranche A Term Loans on the Closing Date and (ii) Revolving Loans at
any time and from time to time prior to the Revolving  Credit Maturity Date, (b)
the Swingline Lender agreed to extend credit,  at any time and from time to time
prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in the form of Swingline Loans, and
(c) the Issuing Bank agreed to issue Letters of Credit.

         Pursuant to the Purchase  Agreement,  the  Borrower  intends to acquire
(the "Acquisition") all the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of a company
identified  to the  Agents  prior to the  Restatement  Date (the  "Target")  for
aggregate consideration not to exceed $90,000,000 in cash, subject to adjustment
as provided in the Purchase Agreement (the "Cash Consideration").

         The Borrowers  have requested the Tranche B Lenders to extend credit in
the form of Tranche B Term Loans on or after the Acquisition Closing Date, in an
aggregate  principal  amount not in excess of  $100,000,000.  The Borrowers have
also requested that the Total Revolving Credit Commitment be increased after the
Restatement Date to an aggregate amount not to exceed $200,000,000.

         The  proceeds  of the Tranche B Term Loans are to be used solely (a) to
pay (or to refinance Revolving Loans used to pay) the Cash Consideration, (b) to
pay related  fees and  expenses  and (c) for  general  corporate  purposes.  The
proceeds of the Revolving  Loans and the  Swingline  Loans are to be used solely
for general corporate  purposes,  including Permitted  Acquisitions.  Letters of
Credit  are to be  used  solely  to  support  payment  obligations,  performance
guarantees and bid bonds incurred by the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their business. Proceeds of any Incremental Term Loans are to be used
solely to finance Permitted Acquisitions and to pay related fees and expenses.

         The  Existing  Lenders are willing to continue the Tranche A Term Loans
and  Revolving  Loans as existing on the  Restatement  Date,  and to continue to
extend  commitments to make Revolving  Loans; the Swingline Lender is willing to
continue  the  Swingline  Loans as  existing  on the  Restatement  Date,  and to
continue to extend  commitments  to make  Swingline  Loans;  the Issuing Bank is
willing to continue to issue

Letters of Credit;  and the  Tranche B Lenders are willing to make the Tranche B
Term Loans on or after the  Acquisition  Closing Date, in each case on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                                 ARTICLE I

                                                Definitions

         SECTION 1.01. Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the meanings specified below:

         "ABR",  when  used in  reference  to any Loan or  Borrowing,  refers to
whether such Loan, or the Loans comprising such Borrowing,  are bearing interest
at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Account"  shall mean any right to payment  for goods sold or leased or
for services rendered, whether or not earned by performance.

         "Account  Debtor" shall mean, with respect to any Account,  the obligor
with respect to such Account.

         "Acquisition" shall have the meaning given to such term in the preamble
to this Agreement.

         "Acquisition Closing Date" shall mean the date on which the Acquisition
shall have been consummated.

         "Adjusted  LIBO  Rate"  shall  mean,  with  respect  to any  Eurodollar
Borrowing for any Interest Period,  an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards,
if necessary,  to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the product of (a) the LIBO Rate
in effect for such Interest Period and (b) Statutory Reserves.

         "Administrative  Agent Fees"  shall have the  meaning  assigned to such
term in Section 2.05(b).

         "Administrative    Questionnaire"    shall   mean   an   Administrative
Questionnaire  in the form of Exhibit  A, or such other form as may be  supplied
from time to time by the Administrative Agent.

         "Affiliate"  shall mean, when used with respect to a specified  person,
another person that directly,  or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
Controls  or is  Controlled  by or is  under  common  Control  with  the  person
specified;  provided,  however,  that for  purposes  of Section  6.07,  the term
"Affiliate"  shall also include any person that directly or indirectly  owns 10%
or more of any class of Equity  Interests of the person  specified or that is an
officer or director of the person specified.

         "Agents" shall mean the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.

         "Aggregate  Revolving  Credit Exposure" shall mean the aggregate amount
of the Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures.

         "Alternate  Base  Rate"  shall  mean,  for any day,  a rate  per  annum

Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. If for any reason the
Administrative  Agent  shall  have  determined  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive  absent  manifest  error) that it is unable to ascertain  the Federal
Funds  Effective Rate for any reason,  including the inability or failure of the
Administrative  Agent to obtain  sufficient  quotations in  accordance  with the
terms of the  definition  thereof,  the Alternate  Base Rate shall be determined
without regard to clause (b) of the preceding  sentence until the  circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist.  Any change in the Alternate Base
Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall
be  effective  on the  effective  date of such  change in the Prime  Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively. The term "Prime Rate" shall mean the
rate  of  interest  per  annum  publicly  announced  from  time  to  time by the
Administrative  Agent as its prime rate for  dollars in effect at its  principal
office in New York City; each change in the Prime Rate shall be effective on the
date such change is publicly  announced as being  effective.  The term  "Federal
Funds Effective Rate" shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates
on overnight  Federal  funds  transactions  with members of the Federal  Reserve
System  arranged by Federal funds brokers,  as published on the next  succeeding
Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is not so
published for any day that is a Business Day, the average of the  quotations for
the day for such transactions  received by the  Administrative  Agent from three
Federal funds brokers of recognized standing selected by it.

         "Amendment Fee" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
2.05(d).

         "Amendment  No. 6" shall mean  Amendment  No. 6,  Waiver and  Agreement
dated as of February 1, 2002, to the Existing Credit Agreement.

         "Applicable Percentage" shall mean (except as otherwise provided in the
Incremental Term Loan Assumption  Agreement with respect to any Incremental Term
Loan),  for any day,  (a) with  respect to any  Eurodollar  Tranche B Term Loan,
3.25%,  (b) with  respect to any ABR  Tranche B Term Loan,  2.25%,  and (c) with
respect  to any  Eurodollar  Tranche  A Term  Loan,  ABR  Tranche  A Term  Loan,
Eurodollar  Revolving  Loan  or ABR  Revolving  Loan,  or  with  respect  to the
Commitment  Fees, as the case may be, the applicable  percentage set forth below
under  the  caption  "Eurodollar  Tranche  A/Revolving  Spread",   "ABR  Tranche
A/Revolving  Spread"  or "Fee  Percentage",  as the case may be,  based upon the
Leverage  Ratio as of the  relevant  date of  determination  (provided,  that if
financial statements and a certificate with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter

Percentage shall be based upon the Leverage Ratio as of such fiscal quarter end,
as determined on the basis of such financial statements):

         Except  as set forth in the  proviso  immediately  preceding  the table

Borrowers hereunder,  including with respect to the payment of all principal of,
and interest on, all Loans and L/C Disbursements,  whether  outstanding prior to
or on and after the Restatement  Date, and all fees,  expenses,  indemnities and
other amounts payable hereunder, shall be joint and several.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

         SECTION 2.01. Commitments.  (a) Tranche A Term Loans. The Borrowers and
the  Lenders  acknowledge  the making of  Tranche A Term Loans in the  aggregate
principal amount of $60,000,000 on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms
of the Existing Credit  Agreement.  Prior to the Restatement  Date, the Borrower
has repaid or prepaid $37,848,774.71 aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A
Term Loans and, accordingly, the Borrowers and the Lenders acknowledge and agree
that Tranche A Term Loans in an  aggregate  principal  amount of  $22,151,225.29
shall  continue to be  outstanding  as of the  Restatement  Date pursuant to the
terms and  conditions of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents.  Amounts
paid or prepaid in respect of Tranche A Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

         (b) Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans.  Subject to the terms and
conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth,
each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, (i) to make a Tranche B Term Loan
to the Borrowers on or after the Acquisition  Closing Date in a principal amount
not to exceed its Term Loan Commitment,  and (ii) to make Revolving Loans to the
Borrowers,  at any time and from time to time on or after the Restatement  Date,
and until the earlier of the Revolving  Credit Maturity Date and the termination
of the Revolving  Credit  Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the terms
hereof,  in an aggregate  principal amount at any time outstanding that will not
result in such Lender's  Revolving  Credit Exposure  exceeding the lesser of (x)
such  Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  and (y)  such  Lender's  Pro Rata
Percentage of the  Borrowing  Base,  each as in effect at such time.  Within the
limits set forth in clause  (ii) of the  preceding  sentence  and subject to the
terms,  conditions and limitations  set forth herein,  the Borrowers may borrow,
prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. The Tranche B Term Loans shall be made in a
single drawing on or after the Acquisition Closing Date. Amounts paid or prepaid
in respect of Tranche B Term Loans may not be reborrowed.  The Borrowers and the
Lenders  acknowledge  the making of Revolving  Loans that are outstanding on the
Restatement  Date in accordance with the terms of the Existing Credit  Agreement
and agree that such Revolving Loans shall continue to be outstanding pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         (c)  Without  limiting   Anteon's   obligations  under  the  Subsidiary
Guarantee  Agreement  with  respect  to the  Obligations  outstanding  under the
Existing Credit Agreement, Anteon hereby assumes, jointly and severally with the
Borrower,  all  liability  as  a  Borrower  with  respect  to  such  outstanding
Obligations.

         SECTION 2.02.  Loans.  (a) Each Loan (other than Swingline Loans) shall
be made as part of a Borrowing  consisting of Loans made by the Lenders  ratably
in accordance with their applicable  Commitments;  provided,  however,  that the
failure  of any Lender to make any Loan  shall not in itself  relieve  any other
Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood,  however,  that
no Lender shall be  responsible  for the failure of any other Lender to make any
Loan  required to be made by such other  Lender).  Except for Loans  deemed made
pursuant to Section  2.02(f),  the Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate  principal  amount that is (i) an integral  multiple of  $1,000,000 or
(ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.

         (b)  Subject  to  Sections  2.08  and  2.15,  each  Borrowing  shall be
comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrowers may request
pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan
by causing any  domestic or foreign  branch or  Affiliate of such Lender to make
such  Loan;  provided  that any  exercise  of such  option  shall not affect the
obligation of the  Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance  with the terms of
this Agreement.  Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same
time; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be entitled to request any
Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than eight  Eurodollar  Borrowings
outstanding  hereunder at any time.  For purposes of the  foregoing,  Eurodollar
Borrowings  having  different  Interest  Periods,  regardless  of  whether  they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

         (c) Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), each
Lender  shall make each Loan to be made by it  hereunder  on the  proposed  date
thereof by wire transfer of immediately  available  funds to such account in New
York City as the  Administrative  Agent may designate not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time,  in the case of a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  or 1:00 p.m.,  New
York City time, in the case of an ABR Borrowing,  and the  Administrative  Agent
shall  promptly  credit the  amounts so  received to an account in the name of a
Borrower,  maintained  with  the  Administrative  Agent  and  designated  by the
Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur
on such date because any condition  precedent  herein  specified  shall not have
been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.

         (d) Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender  prior  to the  date of any  Borrowing  that  such  Lender  will not make
available to the  Administrative  Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that such  Lender  has made such  portion
available  to the  Administrative  Agent  on  the  date  of  such  Borrowing  in
accordance  with  paragraph  (c)  above and the  Administrative  Agent  may,  in
reliance upon such  assumption,  make  available to the Borrowers on such date a
corresponding  amount.  If the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have so made funds
available  then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative  Agent, such Lender and the Borrowers  severally
agree  to  repay  to  the   Administrative   Agent   forthwith  on  demand  such
corresponding  amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made  available  to the  Borrowers  until the date such amount is
repaid  to the  Administrative  Agent at (i) in the case of the  Borrowers,  the
interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans  comprising such Borrowing and
(ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the  Administrative  Agent
to represent its cost of


<PAGE>


                                       29


overnight or short-term funds (which  determination  shall be conclusive  absent
manifest  error).  If such Lender shall repay to the  Administrative  Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of
such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         (e)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Agreement,   the
Borrowers shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the
Interest  Period  requested  with respect  thereto would end after the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date.

         (f) If the Issuing Bank shall not have  received from the Borrowers the
payment required to be made by Section 2.23(e) within the time specified in such
Section,  the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Administrative  Agent of the
L/C  Disbursement  and  the  Administrative  Agent  will  promptly  notify  each
Revolving  Credit Lender of such L/C  Disbursement  and its Pro Rata  Percentage
thereof.  Each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the  Administrative  Agent not later than 2:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Credit Lender shall have received
such notice later than 12:00  (noon),  New York City time, on any day, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day),
an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata  Percentage  of such L/C  Disbursement
(it being  understood  that such  amount  shall be deemed to  constitute  an ABR
Revolving  Loan of such Lender and such payment  shall be deemed to have reduced
the L/C Exposure), and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing
Bank  amounts  so  received  by  it  from  the  Revolving  Credit  Lenders.  The
Administrative  Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank any amounts received
by it from the Borrowers  pursuant to Section 2.23(e) prior to the time that any
Revolving  Credit Lender makes any payment  pursuant to this  paragraph (f); any
such amounts  received by the  Administrative  Agent thereafter will be promptly
remitted by the Administrative  Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall
have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their  interests may appear.
If any Revolving  Credit  Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata  Percentage of
such L/C Disbursement  available to the Administrative  Agent as provided above,
such Lender and the  Borrowers  severally  agree to pay interest on such amount,
for each day from and  including  the date such amount is required to be paid in
accordance with this paragraph to but excluding the date such amount is paid, to
the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in the case
of the  Borrowers,  a rate per annum equal to the interest  rate  applicable  to
Revolving  Loans  pursuant  to  Section  2.06(a),  and  (ii) in the case of such
Lender,  for the first such day, the Federal Funds  Effective Rate, and for each
day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.

         SECTION  2.03.  Borrowing  Procedure.  In order to request a  Borrowing
(other than a Swingline Loan or a deemed Borrowing  pursuant to Section 2.02(f),
as to which this Section 2.03 shall not apply), the Borrowers shall hand deliver
or fax to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Borrowing Request (a) in the
case of a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before a proposed  Borrowing,  and (b) in the case of an ABR
Borrowing,  not later than 12:00  noon,  New York City time,  one  Business  Day
before a proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable,  shall
be signed  by or on behalf of the  Borrowers  and shall  specify  the  following
information: (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Tranche B
Term Borrowing,  an Incremental Term Borrowing or a Revolving Credit  Borrowing,
and whether such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar  Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing;
(ii) the date of such  Borrowing  (which  shall be a  Business  Day),  (iii) the
number and  location of the account to which  funds are to be  disbursed  (which
shall be an account that complies  with the  requirements  of Section  2.02(c));
(iv)  the  amount  of  such  Borrowing;  and (v) if  such  Borrowing  is to be a
Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto;


<PAGE>


                                       30


provided,  however,  that,  notwithstanding  any contrary  specification  in any
Borrowing Request,  each requested  Borrowing shall comply with the requirements
set  forth in  Section  2.02.  If no  election  as to the Type of  Borrowing  is
specified  in any such  notice,  then the  requested  Borrowing  shall be an ABR
Borrowing.  If no Interest  Period with respect to any  Eurodollar  Borrowing is
specified  in any such  notice,  then the  Borrowers  shall  be  deemed  to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall  promptly  advise the  applicable  Lenders of any notice given pursuant to
this Section 2.03 (and the contents  thereof),  and of each Lender's  portion of
the requested Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.04.  Evidence of Debt;  Repayment of Loans. (a) The Borrowers
hereby  unconditionally  promise to pay to (i) the Administrative  Agent (x) for
the account of each Lender holding Term Loans, the principal amount of each Term
Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.11, and (y) for the account of each
Revolving Credit Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
of such Lender on the Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date,  and (ii) the Swingline
Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date.

         (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts  evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender
resulting  from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,  including  the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid such Lender from time to time
under this Agreement.

         (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will
record  (i) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the Type  thereof  and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable  from the  Borrowers to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder from the Borrowers or any Subsidiary Guarantor and each Lender's share
thereof.

         (d) The entries made in the accounts  maintained pursuant to paragraphs
(b) and (c) above shall be prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of
the obligations  therein recorded;  provided,  however,  that the failure of any
Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent to  maintain  such  accounts  or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrowers to repay
the Loans in accordance with their terms.

         (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it hereunder be evidenced
by a promissory  note. In such event, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to
such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered  assigns
and in a form and substance  reasonably  acceptable to the Administrative  Agent
and the Borrowers. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the
event any Lender shall request and receive such a promissory note, the interests
represented by such note shall at all times  (including  after any assignment of
all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more  promissory  notes  payable to the payee  named  therein or its  registered
assigns.

         SECTION  2.05.  Fees.  (a) The  Borrowers  agree to pay to each Lender,
through the Administrative  Agent, on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year and on each date on which any Revolving Credit  Commitment
of such Lender shall expire or be  terminated as provided  herein,  a commitment
fee (a "Commitment Fee") equal to the Applicable  Percentage per annum in effect
from time to time on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Credit  Commitment
of such Lender during the preceding quarter (or other


<PAGE>


                                       31


period ending with the Revolving  Credit  Maturity Date or the date on which the
Revolving Credit  Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated).  All
Commitment  Fees shall be  computed  on the basis of the  actual  number of days
elapsed  in a year of 360 days.  The  Commitment  Fee due to each  Lender  shall
commence to accrue on the Restatement Date and shall cease to accrue on the date
on which the  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  of such Lender  shall  expire or be
terminated as provided herein. For purposes of calculating Commitment Fees only,
no portion of the Revolving  Credit  Commitments  shall be deemed utilized under
Section 2.17 as a result of outstanding Swingline Loans.

         (b) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account,  the administration  fees set forth in the Fee Letters at the times and
in  the  amounts  specified  therein  (the  "Administrative  Agent  Fees").  The
Borrowers  agree  to pay to the  Collateral  Agent,  for  its own  account,  the
collateral  agent's fees set forth in the  Collateral  Agent's Fee Letter at the
times and in the amounts specified therein (the "Collateral Agent's Fees").

         (c) The Borrowers  agree to pay (i) to each  Revolving  Credit  Lender,
through the  Administrative  Agent,  on the last  Business  Day of March,  June,
September  and  December  of each  year and on the date on which  the  Revolving
Credit  Commitment of such Lender shall be terminated as provided  herein, a fee
(an "L/C Participation  Fee") calculated on such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of
the  average  daily  aggregate  L/C  Exposure  (excluding  the  portion  thereof
attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements) during the preceding quarter (or
shorter  period  ending with the Revolving  Credit  Maturity Date or the date on
which all Letters of Credit have been canceled or have expired and the Revolving
Credit Commitments of all Lenders shall have been terminated) at a rate equal to
the Applicable  Percentage from time to time used to determine the interest rate
on Revolving Credit Borrowings comprised of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to Section
2.06,  and (ii) to the  Issuing  Bank with  respect to each Letter of Credit the
standard fronting,  issuance and drawing fees specified from time to time by the
Issuing Bank (the "Issuing Bank Fees").  All L/C Participation  Fees and Issuing
Bank Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in
a year of 360 days.

         (d) The Borrowers agree to pay,  through the  Administrative  Agent, to
each Lender that executes and delivers to the Administrative Agent a counterpart
of  this  Agreement  signed  on  behalf  of  such  party  (or  written  evidence
satisfactory   to  the   Administrative   Agent  (which  may  include   telecopy
transmission  of a signed  signature page of this Agreement) that such party has
signed a counterpart of this  agreement) on or prior to the  Restatement  Date a
fee (an "Amendment  Fee") on the Restatement Date in an amount equal to 0.25% of
the sum of such Lender's outstanding Term Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments
(whether used or unused) under the Existing Credit Agreement  immediately  prior
to the effectiveness of this Agreement.

         (e) The Borrowers  agree to pay to each  Incremental  Revolving  Credit
Lender,  through the Administrative Agent, the fees (the "Incremental  Revolving
Credit  Commitment  Fees") in the amounts and on the dates  provided for in such
Incremental  Revolving Credit Lender's  Incremental  Revolving Credit Assumption
Agreement.

         (f) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in  immediately  available
funds,  to the  Administrative  Agent for  distribution,  if and as appropriate,
among the Lenders,  except that the Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid  directly to
the Issuing  Bank.  Once paid,  none of the Fees shall be  refundable  under any
circumstances.

                                       32


         SECTION  2.06.  Interest  on Loans.  (a) Subject to the  provisions  of
Section 2.07, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing,  including each Swingline
Loan,  shall bear  interest  (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may be, when the  Alternate
Base Rate is  determined  by  reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360
days at all  other  times and  calculated  from and  including  the date of such
Borrowing to but  excluding  the date of repayment  thereof) at a rate per annum
equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the  Applicable  Percentage in effect from
time to time.

         (b) Subject to the  provisions  of Section 2.07,  the Loans  comprising
each  Eurodollar  Borrowing  shall bear  interest  (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal
to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest  Period in effect for such  Borrowing
plus the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time.

         (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable to the Administrative  Agent
on the  Interest  Payment  Dates  applicable  to such Loan  except as  otherwise
provided in this Agreement.  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO
Rate shall be determined by the  Administrative  Agent,  and such  determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.07.  Default Interest.  If the Borrowers shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder,  by acceleration or otherwise,  or under any other Loan Document,
the  Borrowers  shall on demand  from time to time pay  interest,  to the extent
permitted by law, on such  defaulted  amount to but excluding the date of actual
payment (after as well as before judgment) (a) in the case of overdue principal,
at the rate  otherwise  applicable  to such Loan  pursuant to Section  2.06 plus
2.00% per annum and (b) in all other cases, at a rate per annum (computed on the
basis of the actual  number of days elapsed  over a year of 365 or 366 days,  as
the case may be, when  determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year
of 360 days at all other times) equal to the rate that would be applicable to an
ABR Revolving Loan plus 2.00%.

         SECTION 2.08.  Alternate  Rate of Interest.  In the event,  and on each
occasion,  that on the day two Business  Days prior to the  commencement  of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar  Borrowing the Administrative  Agent shall have
determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such Borrowing are not generally  available in the London interbank  market,  or
that the  rates  at which  such  dollar  deposits  are  being  offered  will not
adequately  and fairly reflect the cost to a majority in interest of the Lenders
making or maintaining such Eurodollar Loans during such Interest Period, or that
reasonable  means do not exist for  ascertaining  the  Adjusted  LIBO Rate,  the
Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable  thereafter,  give written or
fax notice of such determination to the Borrowers and the Lenders.  In the event
of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the
Borrowers and the Lenders that the  circumstances  giving rise to such notice no
longer exist (which the Administrative Agent agrees to do as soon as practicable
after such  circumstances  cease to exist),  any request by the  Borrowers for a
Eurodollar  Borrowing  pursuant to Section  2.03 or 2.10 shall be deemed to be a
request for an ABR Borrowing.  Each  determination by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.09.  Termination and Reduction of  Commitments.  (a) The Term
Loan Commitments (other than any Incremental Term Loan Commitments,  which shall
terminate in accordance  with the applicable  Incremental  Term Loan  Assumption
Agreement)  shall  automatically  terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Tranche B Funding Date.


<PAGE>


                                       33


     The Revolving  Credit  Commitments,  the Swingline  Commitment  and the L/C
Commitment shall automatically  terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Term Loan Commitments  shall  automatically
terminate at 5:00 p.m.,  New York City time, on December 31, 2002, or such later
date as may be agreed to by the Borrowers and each of the Tranche B Lenders,  if
the Tranche B Funding Date shall not have occurred by such time.

         (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or fax
notice  to the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Borrowers  may at any time in whole
permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Term
Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit Commitments;  provided,  however,  that
(i) each partial  reduction of the Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit
Commitments  shall be in an integral  multiple of $1,000,000  and (ii) the Total
Revolving Credit  Commitment shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than
the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at the time.

         (c) Each reduction in the Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit
Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their  respective  applicable  Commitments.  The  Borrowers  shall  pay  to  the
Administrative  Agent for the account of the applicable  Lenders, on the date of
each  termination  or  reduction,  the  Commitment  Fees  on the  amount  of the
Commitments  so terminated or reduced  accrued to but excluding the date of such
termination or reduction.

         SECTION 2.10. Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings.  The Borrowers
shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  upon  prior  irrevocable  notice  to the
Administrative Agent (a) not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the
day of conversion,  to convert any  Eurodollar  Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing,
(b) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time,  three Business Days prior to
conversion  or  continuation,  to convert any ABR  Borrowing  into a  Eurodollar
Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar  Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing for
an additional  Interest Period, and (c) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time,  three Business Days prior to conversion,  to convert the Interest  Period
with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period,
subject in each case to the following:

                  (i) each  conversion  or  continuation  shall be made pro rata
         among the Lenders in accordance with the respective  principal  amounts
         of the Loans comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;

                  (ii) if less than all the outstanding  principal amount of any
         Borrowing  shall  be  converted  or  continued,   then  each  resulting
         Borrowing shall satisfy the limitations  specified in Sections  2.02(a)
         and  2.02(b)  regarding  the  principal  amount and  maximum  number of
         Borrowings of the relevant Type;

                  (iii) each conversion shall be effected by each Lender and the
         Administrative  Agent by  recording  for the account of such Lender the
         new Type and/or Interest Period for such Borrowing  resulting from such
         conversion;  accrued  interest  on  any  Eurodollar  Loan  (or  portion
         thereof) being  converted shall be paid by the Borrowers at the time of
         conversion;

                  (iv) if any Eurodollar  Borrowing is converted at a time other
         than the end of the Interest Period applicable  thereto,  the Borrowers
         shall pay,  upon  demand,  any amounts  due to the Lenders  pursuant to
         Section 2.16;



<PAGE>


                                       34


                  (v) any  portion of a  Borrowing  maturing  or  required to be
         repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as
         a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (vi) any  portion of a  Eurodollar  Borrowing  that  cannot be
         converted into or continued as a Eurodollar  Borrowing by reason of the
         immediately  preceding clause shall be  automatically  converted at the
         end of the  Interest  Period in effect for such  Borrowing  into an ABR
         Borrowing;

                  (vii) no Interest  Period may be selected  for any  Eurodollar
         Term Borrowing that would end later than a Tranche A Repayment  Date, a
         Tranche B Repayment Date or an Incremental Term Loan Repayment Date, as
         applicable, occurring on or after the first day of such Interest Period
         if, after giving effect to such  selection,  the aggregate  outstanding
         amount of (A) the  Eurodollar  Term  Borrowings  comprised of Tranche A
         Term  Loans,  Tranche  B Term  Loans and  Incremental  Term  Loans,  as
         applicable,  with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such Tranche A
         Repayment  Date,  Tranche B  Repayment  Date or  Incremental  Term Loan
         Repayment  Date,  respectively,  and (B) the ABR Term  Loan  Borrowings
         comprised of Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Incremental
         Term Loans, as applicable, would not be at least equal to the principal
         amount of Term  Borrowings to be paid on such Tranche A Repayment Date,
         Tranche  B  Repayment  Date or  Incremental  Tem Loan  Repayment  Date,
         respectively; and

                  (viii) upon notice to the  Borrowers  from the  Administrative
         Agent  given  at  the  request  of  the  Required  Lenders,  after  the
         occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default,
         no  outstanding  Loan  may  be  converted  into,  or  continued  as,  a
         Eurodollar Loan.

         Each notice  pursuant to this  Section  2.10 shall be  irrevocable  and
shall refer to this  Agreement  and specify (i) the  identity  and amount of the
Borrowing  that the Borrowers  request be converted or  continued,  (ii) whether
such  Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar  Borrowing or
an ABR Borrowing,  (iii) if such notice requests a conversion,  the date of such
conversion  (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such  Borrowing is to be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the Interest  Period with
respect  thereto.  If no Interest  Period is  specified  in any such notice with
respect to any  conversion to or  continuation  as a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the
Borrowers  shall be deemed to have  selected an  Interest  Period of one month's
duration.  The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each  Lender's  portion of any converted or
continued Borrowing.  If the Borrowers shall not have given notice in accordance
with this Section 2.10 to continue any  Eurodollar  Borrowing  into a subsequent
Interest  Period (and shall not otherwise  have given notice in accordance  with
this Section 2.10 to convert such  Borrowing),  such Borrowing shall, at the end
of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms
hereof), automatically be converted into an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION  2.11.  Repayment  of Term  Borrowings.  (a) The Tranche A Term
Borrowings  shall be  payable as to  principal  in 17  consecutive  installments
payable on the last Business Day of March, June,  September and December of each
year, commencing on the last Business Day in June 2001 and ending on the Tranche
A Maturity Date (each such date being called a "Tranche A Repayment Date"). Each
of the first 16  installments  shall be in an  amount  equal to  4.6875%  of the
initial  aggregate  principal amount of the Tranche A Term Borrowings,  with the
balance due and payable on the Tranche A Maturity Date.



<PAGE>


                                       35


         (b)  The  Tranche  B  Term  Borrowings   (other  than  Term  Borrowings
consisting  of  Other  Term  Loans)  shall  be  payable  as to  principal  in 25
consecutive  installments  payable  on the last  Business  Day of  March,  June,
September  and  December of each year,  commencing  on the last  Business Day in
December  2002 and ending on the  Tranche B Maturity  Date (each such date being
called a "Tranche B Repayment Date"). Each of the first 21 installments shall be
in an amount  equal to 0.25% of the initial  aggregate  principal  amount of the
Tranche B Term Borrowings,  and each of the final 4 installments  shall be in an
amount  equal to  23.6875%  of the  initial  aggregate  principal  amount of the
Tranche B Term  Borrowings,  with the  balance  due and payable on the Tranche B
Maturity Date.

         (c)  The  Borrowers  shall  pay to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the
account  of the  Lenders,  on each  Incremental  Term  Loan  Repayment  Date,  a
principal amount of the Other Term Loans (as adjusted from time to time pursuant
to Sections 2.12 and 2.13(g)) equal to the amount set forth for such date in the
applicable  Incremental  Term  Loan  Assumption  Agreement.  To the  extent  not
previously  paid,  all  Incremental  Term Loans  shall be due and payable on the
Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date.

         (d) Each payment of Term Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall
be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount paid to but excluding
the date of payment.

         SECTION 2.12. Prepayment. (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, upon at
least three  Business  Days' prior  written or fax notice (or  telephone  notice
promptly confirmed by written or fax notice) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or
written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly  confirmed by written or fax
notice) on or prior to the date of prepayment  in the case of ABR Loans,  to the
Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City time;  provided,  however,
that each partial  prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple
of $1,000,000.

         (b) Optional  prepayments of Term Loans made by the Borrowers  pursuant
to paragraph  (a) above shall be allocated  among the Tranche A Term Loans,  the
Tranche B Term Loans and any Other Term  Loans (and to the  remaining  scheduled
installments  of  principal  due in respect of any such Term  Loans) in a manner
determined at the discretion of the Borrowers.

         (c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid,  shall be
irrevocable  and shall  commit the  Borrowers  to prepay such  Borrowing  by the
amount stated therein on the date stated  therein.  All  prepayments  under this
Section 2.12 shall be subject to Section 2.16 but otherwise  without  premium or
penalty.  All  prepayments of Eurodollar  Loans under this Section 2.12 shall be
accompanied  by accrued  interest on the  principal  amount being prepaid to the
date of payment.  Interest on ABR Loans prepaid under this Section 2.12 shall be
paid in accordance with Section 2.06(c).

         SECTION  2.13.  Mandatory   Prepayments.   (a)  In  the  event  of  any
termination of all the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrowers shall, on the
date of such termination, repay or prepay all their outstanding Revolving Credit
Borrowings  and all  outstanding  Swingline  Loans and replace  all  outstanding
Letters of Credit and/or  deposit an amount equal to the L/C Exposure in cash in
a cash collateral account  established with the Collateral Agent for the benefit
of the Secured Parties.  In the event of any partial  reduction of the Revolving
Credit  Commitments,  then  (i)  at or  prior  to the  effective  date  of  such
reduction, the


<PAGE>


                                       36


Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Revolving Credit Lenders
of the Aggregate  Revolving Credit Exposure after giving effect thereto and (ii)
if the Aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Exposure  would exceed the Total  Revolving
Credit Commitment after giving effect to such reduction or termination, then the
Borrowers  shall, on the date of such reduction or termination,  repay or prepay
Revolving Credit Borrowings or Swingline Loans (or a combination thereof) and/or
replace  or cash  collateralize  outstanding  Letters  of  Credit  in an  amount
sufficient to eliminate such excess.

         (b) If on any date the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed
the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers  shall on such date repay or prepay  Revolving
Credit  Borrowings or Swingline Loans (or a combination  thereof) and/or replace
or cash collateralize  outstanding  Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient to
eliminate such excess.

         (c) Not later than the third  Business Day following the  completion of
any Asset Sale, the Borrowers shall apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
with respect thereto to prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section
2.13(g).

         (d) In the event and on each occasion that an Equity  Issuance  occurs,
the Borrowers  shall,  substantially  simultaneously  with (and in any event not
later than the third Business Day next  following) the occurrence of such Equity
Issuance,  apply the lesser of (i) 50% of the Net Cash  Proceeds  therefrom  and
(ii) the amount  required  to achieve a Senior  Leverage  Ratio that is at least
0.25 to 1.0 less than the maximum Senior  Leverage Ratio permitted under Section
6.12  applicable  at the time of,  and  after  giving  effect  to,  such  Equity
Issuance, to prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(g).

         (e) No later  than the  earlier  of (i) 90 days  after  the end of each
fiscal year of the Borrower,  commencing with the fiscal year ending on December
31, 2002,  and (ii) the date on which the financial  statements  with respect to
such period are  delivered  pursuant to Section  5.04(a),  the  Borrowers  shall
prepay outstanding Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.13(g) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year then ended
only if the  Senior  Leverage  Ratio at the end of such  year  shall  have  been
greater than 0.25 to 1.0 less than the maximum Senior  Leverage Ratio  permitted
under Section 6.12 at the end of such fiscal year.

         (f) In the event that any Loan Party or any  subsidiary of a Loan Party
shall  receive  Net Cash  Proceeds  from the  issuance or other  disposition  of
Indebtedness  for money  borrowed of any Loan Party or any  subsidiary of a Loan
Party (other than Indebtedness for money borrowed  permitted pursuant to Section
6.01), the Borrowers shall, substantially  simultaneously with (and in any event
not later than the third  Business Day next  following)  the receipt of such Net
Cash  Proceeds by such Loan Party or such  subsidiary,  apply an amount equal to
100% of such Net Cash  Proceeds to prepay  outstanding  Term Loans in accordance
with Section 2.13(g).

         (g)  Mandatory   prepayments  of  outstanding  Term  Loans  under  this
Agreement shall be applied pro rata between the then-outstanding  Tranche A Term
Loans,  Tranche B Term Loans and Other Term Loans,  and subject to paragraph (i)
below,  applied  pro  rata  against  the  remaining  scheduled  installments  of
principal due in respect of Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Other
Term Loans under Sections 2.11 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

         (h) The Borrowers  shall deliver to the  Administrative  Agent,  at the
time of each pre payment  required  under this Section  2.13,  (i) a certificate
signed by a Financial Officer of the


<PAGE>


                                       37


Borrowers  setting forth in reasonable  detail the  calculation of the amount of
such  prepayment and (ii) to the extent  practicable,  at least three days prior
written notice of such  prepayment.  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the
prepayment date, the Type of each Loan being prepaid and the principal amount of
each Loan (or portion  thereof) to be prepaid.  All  prepayments  of  Borrowings
under this Section 2.13 shall be subject to Section 2.16, but shall otherwise be
without premium or penalty.

         (i) Any  Tranche  B  Lender  and,  to the  extent  so  provided  in the
applicable  Incremental  Term Loan Assumption  Agreement,  any Incremental  Term
Lender, so long as any Tranche A Term Loans shall remain outstanding, may elect,
by notice to the  Administrative  Agent in writing no later than 3:00 p.m.,  New
York City time, at least two Business Days prior to any  prepayment of Tranche B
Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, as the case may be, required to be made by
the Borrowers  for the account of such Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.13, to
cause  all or a portion  of such  prepayment  to be  applied  instead  to prepay
Tranche A Term Loans in accordance with paragraph (g) above.

         SECTION  2.14.  Reserve  Requirements;  Change  in  Circumstances.  (a)
Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement,  if any Change in Law
shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special deposit or similar
requirement  against  assets of,  deposits  with or for the account of or credit
extended by any Lender or the Issuing Bank (except any such reserve  requirement
which is reflected in the Adjusted  LIBO Rate) or shall impose on such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or the London  interbank  market any other condition  affecting
this  Agreement or Eurodollar  Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit
or  participation  therein,  and the result of any of the foregoing  shall be to
increase  the cost to such Lender or the Issuing  Bank of making or  maintaining
any Eurodollar Loan or increase the cost to any Lender of issuing or maintaining
any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining a participation  therein or to
reduce  the  amount of any sum  received  or  receivable  by such  Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder  (whether of principal,  interest or otherwise),  in each
case,  by an amount  deemed by such Lender or the Issuing  Bank to be  material,
then the Borrowers  will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, upon demand in accordance with paragraph (c) below such additional amount or
amounts as will  compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

         (b) If any Lender or the Issuing  Bank shall have  determined  that any
Change  in Law  regarding  capital  adequacy  has or would  have the  effect  of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made or  participations in Letters of
Credit  purchased by such Lender pursuant hereto or the Letters of Credit issued
by the Issuing Bank  pursuant  hereto to a level below that which such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing  Bank's  holding  company could
have  achieved  but for such  Change  In Law  (taking  into  consideration  such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the
Issuing  Bank's holding  company with respect to capital  adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time
in accordance with paragraph (c) below the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional  amount or amounts as will
compensate  such  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank or such  Lender's  or the Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

         (c) A  certificate  of a Lender or the Issuing Bank  setting  forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding  company,  as  applicable,  as specified in paragraph  (a) or (b) above,
together with supporting


<PAGE>


                                       38


documentation  or  computations  in each  case in  reasonable  detail,  shall be
delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive  absent manifest  error.  The
Borrowers  shall pay such Lender or the Issuing  Bank the amount shown as due on
any such  certificate  delivered  by it within 10 days after its  receipt of the
same.

         (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the  Issuing  Bank to
demand  compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
receivable  or reduction in return on capital  shall not  constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;  provided
that the Borrowers shall not be under any obligation to compensate any Lender or
the Issuing  Bank under  paragraph  (a) or (b) above with  respect to  increased
costs or  reductions  with  respect to any period  prior to the date that is 120
days prior to such  request  if such  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank knew or could
reasonably have been expected to know of the  circumstances  giving rise to such
increased  costs or  reductions  and of the fact that such  circumstances  would
result in a claim for increased  compensation  by reason of such increased costs
or reductions; provided further that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
any increased costs or reductions arising out of the retroactive  application of
any Change in Law within such 120-day period.

         SECTION  2.15.  Change  in  Legality.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  other
provision of this  Agreement,  if, after the Closing Date, any change in any law
or regulation or in the  interpretation  thereof by any  Governmental  Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar  Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent:

                  (i) such Lender may  declare  that  Eurodollar  Loans will not
         thereafter  (for the  duration  of such  unlawfulness)  be made by such
         Lender  hereunder (or be continued for additional  Interest Periods and
         ABR Loans will not  thereafter  (for such  duration) be converted  into
         Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or
         to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar  Borrowing or to continue a
         Eurodollar  Borrowing for an additional  Interest  Period) shall, as to
         such Lender only,  be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to
         continue  an ABR Loan as such or to convert a  Eurodollar  Loan into an
         ABR  Loan,  as the case  may  be),  unless  such  declaration  shall be
         subsequently  withdrawn  (which such Lender agrees to do as promptly as
         practicable after circumstances allow); and

             (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding  Eurodollar Loans
         made  by it be  converted  to  ABR  Loans,  in  which  event  all  such
         Eurodollar  Loans shall be  automatically  converted to ABR Loans as of
         the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall  exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above,  all
payments and  prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to
repay the  Eurodollar  Loans  that  would  have been made by such  Lender or the
converted  Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting  from the  conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.

         (b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrowers by any
Lender  shall be effective as to each  Eurodollar  Loan made by such Lender,  if
lawful,  on  the  last  day of the  Interest  Period  then  applicable  to  such
Eurodollar  Loan;  in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date
of receipt by the Borrowers.

                                       39


         SECTION 2.16.  Indemnity.  The Borrowers  shall  indemnify  each Lender
against any loss or expense  (other than any loss of margin over funding cost or
anticipated  profit) that such Lender may sustain or incur as a  consequence  of
(a) any event,  other than a default by such  Lender in the  performance  of its
obligations  hereunder,  which  results in (i) such  Lender  receiving  or being
deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar  Loan
prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor,  (ii) the conversion
of any Eurodollar  Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period
with respect to any Eurodollar  Loan, in each case other than on the last day of
the Interest Period in effect therefor,  or (iii) any Eurodollar Loan to be made
by  such  Lender  (including  any  Eurodollar  Loan  to be  made  pursuant  to a
conversion  or  continuation  under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of
such Loan shall have been given by the  Borrowers  hereunder  (any of the events
referred  to in this  clause  (a) being  called a  "Breakage  Event") or (b) any
default  in  the  making  of any  payment  or  prepayment  required  to be  made
hereunder.  In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include an amount
equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of
obtaining  funds for the  Eurodollar  Loan that is the subject of such  Breakage
Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the
Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over
(ii) the amount of interest  likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying
the funds  released or not  utilized by reason of such  Breakage  Event for such
period.  A  certificate  of any  Lender in  reasonable  detail  with  supporting
calculations  setting  forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be delivered to the Borrowers and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION  2.17.  Pro Rata  Treatment.  Except as provided  below in this
Section 2.17 with respect to Swingline Loans and as required under Section 2.15,
each Borrowing,  each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing,  each
payment of interest on the Loans,  each  payment of the  Commitment  Fees,  each
reduction of the Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving  Credit  Commitments and
each  conversion  of any  Borrowing  to or  continuation  of any  Borrowing as a
Borrowing  of any Type  shall  be  allocated  pro  rata  among  the  Lenders  in
accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments
shall  have  expired  or been  terminated,  in  accordance  with the  respective
principal amounts of their outstanding  Loans).  For purposes of determining the
available  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  of  the  Lenders  at any  time,  each
outstanding Swingline Loan shall be deemed to have utilized the Revolving Credit
Commitments  of the Lenders  (including  those Lenders which shall not have made
Swingline  Loans) pro rata in accordance with such respective  Revolving  Credit
Commitments.  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's  portion of any
Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion,
round each  Lender's  percentage  of such  Borrowing to the next higher or lower
whole dollar amount.

         SECTION 2.18. Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the  Borrowers  or any other Loan Party,  or  pursuant to a secured  claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other  security or interest
arising from, or in lieu of, such secured  claim,  received by such Lender under
any applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar law or otherwise,  or by
any other means,  obtain payment  (voluntary or  involuntary)  in respect of any
Obligation as a result of which the unpaid portion of its  Obligations  shall be
proportionately  less than the unpaid  portion of the  Obligations  of any other
Lender,  it shall be deemed  simultaneously  to have  purchased  from such other
Lender at face value,  and shall  promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase
price for, a participation in the Obligations of such other Lender,  so that the
aggregate  unpaid amount of the  Obligations and  participations  in Obligations
held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid


<PAGE>


                                       40


amount of all  Obligations  then  outstanding  as the amount of its  Obligations
prior to such exercise of banker's lien,  setoff or  counterclaim or other event
was to the  amount of all  Obligations  outstanding  prior to such  exercise  of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that if
any such  purchase or purchases or  adjustments  shall be made  pursuant to this
Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall  thereafter be recovered,
such  purchase or purchases or  adjustments  shall be rescinded to the extent of
such recovery and the purchase  price or prices or adjustment  restored  without
interest.  The Borrowers  expressly  consent to the foregoing  arrangements  and
agrees that any Lender holding a participation  in an Obligation  deemed to have
been so purchased  may exercise any and all rights of banker's  lien,  setoff or
counterclaim  with respect to any and all moneys owing by the  Borrowers to such
Lender by reason  thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to
the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.

         SECTION  2.19.  Payments.  (a) The  Borrowers  shall make each  payment
(including  principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any L/C Disbursement or
any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later
than  1:00  p.m.,  New  York  City  time,  on the date  when due in  immediately
available dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim;  provided,  however,
that the  Borrowers  shall make each  payment of  principal  of or  interest  on
Swingline  Loans not later  than  12:00  (noon),  New York City time . Each such
payment  (other than (i) Issuing Bank Fees,  which shall be paid directly to the
Issuing Bank, and (ii) principal of and interest on Swingline Loans, which shall
be paid directly to the Swingline Lender except as otherwise provided in Section
2.22(e))  shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent at its  offices  at Eleven
Madison Avenue, New York, New York.

         (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment
(including  principal  of or  interest  on any  Borrowing  or any  Fees or other
amounts)  hereunder  or under any other  Loan  Document  shall  become  due,  or
otherwise  would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be
made on the next  succeeding  Business Day, and such  extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

         SECTION 2.20.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrowers or any Loan Party  hereunder or under any other Loan
Document  shall  be  made  free  and  clear  of and  without  deduction  for any
Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes;  provided  that if the  Borrowers or any Loan
Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions  (including  deductions  applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the
case may be) receives an amount  equal to the sum it would have  received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers or such Loan Party shall make such
deductions  and (iii) the Borrowers or such Loan Party shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant  Governmental  Authority in accordance  with applicable
law.

         (b) In  addition,  the  Borrowers  shall  pay any  Other  Taxes  to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) The Borrowers  shall  indemnify the  Administrative  Agent and each
Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes  paid by the  Administrative  Agent or such
Lender,  as the case may be, on or with  respect to any payment by or on account
of any  obligation  of the  Borrowers  or any Loan Party  hereunder or under any
other Loan  Document  (including  Indemnified  Taxes or Other  Taxes  imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any


<PAGE>


                                       41


penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising  therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally  imposed  or  asserted  by  the  relevant  Governmental   Authority.   A
certificate  as to the amount of such  payment  or  liability  delivered  to the
Borrowers by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) As soon as practicable  after any payment of  Indemnified  Taxes or
Other  Taxes  by the  Borrowers  or  any  other  Loan  Party  to a  Governmental
Authority,  the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original
or  a  certified  copy  of a  receipt  issued  by  such  Governmental  Authority
evidencing  such payment,  a copy of the return  reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e)  Any  Foreign  Lender  that is  entitled  to an  exemption  from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of a jurisdiction in which a Borrower
is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the
Administrative  Agent), on or prior to the Restatement Date, or in the case of a
Lender  that is an  assignee  or  transferee  of an  interest  under this Credit
Agreement  pursuant  to Section  9.04  (unless  the Lender was  already a Lender
hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such
assignment or transfer to such Lender,  such  accurate,  properly  completed and
executed  documentation  prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by
the Borrowers as will permit such payments to be made without  withholding or at
a reduced rate. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the
Closing  Date,  when a lapse in time or  change  in  circumstances  renders  the
previous  certification  obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will
deliver to the Borrowers  and the  Administrative  Agent new accurate,  properly
completed and executed  documentation  prescribed by applicable law or as may be
required in order to confirm or establish  the  entitlement  of such Lender to a
continued  exemption  from or reduction in United  States  withholding  tax with
respect to payments  under this Credit  Agreement and any Revolving  Loan, or it
shall  immediately  notify the  Borrowers  and the  Administrative  Agent of its
inability to deliver any such documentation, in which case such Lender shall not
be required to deliver any such documentation, pursuant to this Section 2.20(e).
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in Section 2.20 but subject
to Section 9.04 and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) each Borrower shall
be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold
income  or  similar  taxes  imposed  by the  United  States  (or  any  political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other
amounts  payable  hereunder  for the  account of any  Lender  which is a Foreign
Lender  to the  extent  that  such  Lender  has not  provided  to the  Borrowers
accurate,  properly  completed  and executed  documentation  that  establishes a
complete  exemption  from such  deduction or  withholding  and (y) the Borrowers
shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 2.20 to make any additional  payments
to a Lender  pursuant  to Section  2.20(b) or  2.20(c),  as the case may be (the
"Gross-Up  Payments")  if such  Lender has not  provided  to the  Borrowers  the
documentation  required to be provided to the Borrowers pursuant to this Section
2.20(e).  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in the  preceding
sentence or  elsewhere  in this  Section 2.20 and except as set forth in Section
9.04, the Borrowers agree to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender
in the manner set forth in Sections  2.20(b) and 2.20(c)  (without regard to the
identity of the jurisdiction  requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect
of any  Taxes  deducted  or  withheld  by it as  described  in  the  immediately
preceding  sentence  as a result of any changes  after the  Closing  Date in any
applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in
the  interpretation  thereof,  relating to the deducting or  withholding of such
Taxes.

                                       42


         (f) If the Borrowers pay any additional  amount under this Section 2.20
to a Lender  and such  Lender  determines  in its  sole  discretion  that it has
actually  received  or  realized  in  connection  therewith  any  refund  or any
reduction of, or credit  against,  its Tax Liabilities in or with respect to the
taxable year in which the  additional  amount is paid,  such Lender shall pay to
the Borrowers an amount that the Lender shall, in its sole discretion, determine
is equal to the net benefit, after tax, which was obtained by the Lender in such
year as a consequence of such refund, reduction or credit.

         SECTION 2.21.  Assignment of Commitments  Under Certain  Circumstances;
Duty to Mitigate. (a) In the event (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a
certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender or
the  Issuing  Bank  delivers  a notice  described  in  Section  2.15,  (iii) the
Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or the Issuing
Bank or any Governmental  Authority on account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant to Section 2.20 or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any amendment,
waiver or other  modification  of any Loan  Document  requested by the Borrowers
that  requires  the  consent of a greater  percentage  of the  Lenders  than the
Required Lenders and such amendment,  waiver or other  modification is consented
to by the Required Lenders,  the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort
(including  with respect to the  processing and  recordation  fee referred to in
Section  9.04(b)),  upon  notice  to such  Lender  or the  Issuing  Bank and the
Administrative  Agent,  require  such Lender or the Issuing Bank to transfer and
assign,  without  recourse (in accordance  with and subject to the  restrictions
contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests,  rights and obligations  under
this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such assigned obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such  assignment);  provided
that (x) such assignment  shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or
order of any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction,  (y) the
Borrowers  shall have received the prior written  consent of the  Administrative
Agent (and, if a Revolving Credit  Commitment is being assigned,  of the Issuing
Bank  and the  Swingline  Lender),  which  consent  shall  not  unreasonably  be
withheld, and (z) the Borrowers or such assignee shall have paid to the affected
Lender or the Issuing Bank in immediately available funds an amount equal to the
sum of the principal of and interest  accrued to the date of such payment on the
outstanding  Loans or L/C  Disbursements  of such  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank,
respectively,  plus all Fees and other  amounts  accrued for the account of such
Lender or the Issuing Bank  hereunder  (including any amounts under Section 2.14
and Section  2.16);  provided  further  that,  if prior to any such transfer and
assignment  the  circumstances  or event that  resulted in such  Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or notice under Section
2.15 or the amounts paid  pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, cease to
cause such Lender or the Issuing Bank to suffer increased costs or reductions in
amounts  received or receivable  or reduction in return on capital,  or cease to
have the  consequences  specified in Section 2.15, or cease to result in amounts
being  payable  under Section 2.20, as the case may be (including as a result of
any action  taken by such Lender or the Issuing Bank  pursuant to paragraph  (b)
below),  or if such  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank shall waive its right to claim
further  compensation  under  Section 2.14 in respect of such  circumstances  or
event or shall  withdraw its notice under  Section 2.15 or shall waive its right
to further  payments  under  Section  2.20 in respect of such  circumstances  or
event,  as the case may be,  then such  Lender  or the  Issuing  Bank  shall not
thereafter be required to make any such transfer and assignment hereunder.

         (b) If (i) any Lender or the Issuing  Bank shall  request  compensation
under  Section  2.14,  (ii) any  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank  delivers a notice
described  in  Section  2.15 or (iii)  the  Borrowers  are  required  to pay any
additional  amount  to  any  Lender  or the  Issuing  Bank  or any  Governmental
Authority  on account of any Lender or the  Issuing  Bank,  pursuant  to Section
2.20, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts (which


<PAGE>


                                       43


shall not require such Lender or the Issuing Bank to incur an unreimbursed  loss
or unreimbursed  cost or expense or otherwise take any action  inconsistent with
its  internal  policies  or legal  or  regulatory  restrictions  or  suffer  any
disadvantage  or  burden  deemed  by it to  be  significant)  (x)  to  file  any
certificate or document reasonably  requested in writing by the Borrowers or (y)
to assign its rights and  delegate and  transfer  its  obligations  hereunder to
another of its offices,  branches or  affiliates,  if such filing or  assignment
would  reduce its claims for  compensation  under  Section  2.14 or enable it to
withdraw its notice  pursuant to Section 2.15 or would  reduce  amounts  payable
pursuant  to Section  2.20,  as the case may be, in the  future.  The  Borrowers
hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses  incurred by any Lender or
the Issuing Bank in connection  with any such filing or  assignment,  delegation
and transfer.

         SECTION 2.22. Swingline Loans. (a) Swingline Commitment. Subject to the
terms and conditions and relying upon the  representations and warranties herein
set forth,  the  Swingline  Lender  agrees to make loans to the Borrowers at any
time and from  time to time on and  after  the  Restatement  Date and  until the
earlier  of the  Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date  and the  termination  of the
Revolving  Credit  Commitments  in  accordance  with  the  terms  hereof,  in an
aggregate  principal  amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i)
the aggregate  principal amount of all Swingline Loans exceeding  $20,000,000 in
the aggregate,  (ii) the Revolving  Credit Exposure of any Lender,  after giving
effect  to  any  Swingline  Loan,   exceeding  such  Lender's  Revolving  Credit
Commitment or (iii) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure, after giving effect
to any Swingline Loan,  exceeding the lesser of (x) the Total  Revolving  Credit
Commitment  and (y) the Borrowing  Base in effect at such time.  Each  Swingline
Loan shall be in a principal  amount that is an integral  multiple of  $100,000.
The  Swingline  Commitment  may be  terminated  or reduced  from time to time as
provided herein.  Within the foregoing limits,  the Borrowers may borrow, pay or
prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans hereunder,  subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein.

         (b) Swingline Loans. The Borrowers shall notify the Swingline Lender by
fax,  or by  telephone  (confirmed  by fax),  with a copy of such  notice to the
Administrative  Agent,  not later than 12:00 (noon),  New York City time, on the
day of a proposed  Swingline  Loan. Such notice shall be delivered on a Business
Day,  shall be  irrevocable  and shall refer to this Agreement and shall specify
the requested  date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of such Swingline
Loan.  The  Swingline  Lender shall make each  Swingline  Loan  available to the
Borrowers by means of a credit to the general deposit account of a Borrower with
the  Swingline  Lender  by 3:00  p.m.  on the  date  such  Swingline  Loan is so
requested.  Pursuant to Section 5.01(c) of the Security Agreement, the Swingline
Lender may apply the funds on deposit in the Concentration Account (as such term
is defined in the Security  Agreement) on any Business Day to repay  outstanding
Swingline Loans.

         (c) Prepayment. The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from
time to time to prepay any  Swingline  Loan,  in whole or in part,  upon  giving
written or fax notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written, or fax
notice) to the  Swingline  Lender and to the  Administrative  Agent  before 1:00
p.m.,  New York City time on the date of prepayment  at the  Swingline  Lender's
address for  notices  specified  on Schedule  2.01.  All  principal  payments of
Swingline Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount
being repaid to the date of payment.

         (d) Interest.  Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan and, subject to
the provisions of Section 2.07, shall bear interest at the rate provided for ABR
Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.06(a).



<PAGE>


                                       44


         (e) Participations. The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to
the  Administrative  Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on any
Business Day require the Revolving Credit Lenders to acquire  participations  on
such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans  outstanding.  Such
notice  shall  specify  the  aggregate  amount of  Swingline  Loans in which the
Revolving  Credit  Lenders  will  participate.  The  Administrative  Agent will,
promptly  upon  receipt of such  notice,  give notice to each  Revolving  Credit
Lender,  specifying  in such notice such  Lender's Pro Rata  Percentage  of such
Swingline Loan or Loans. In furtherance of the foregoing,  each Revolving Credit
Lender hereby absolutely and  unconditionally  agrees, upon receipt of notice as
provided  above,  to pay to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the  account of the
Swingline  Lender,  such Revolving  Credit  Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such
Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving  Credit Lender  acknowledges and agrees
that its  obligation to acquire  participations  in Swingline  Loans pursuant to
this  paragraph is absolute and  unconditional  and shall not be affected by any
circumstance  whatsoever,  including the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or an Event of Default,  and that each such  payment  shall be made  without any
offset,  abatement,  withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each Revolving Credit
Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately  available  funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c)
with  respect to Loans made by such Lender (and  Section  2.02(c)  shall  apply,
mutatis  mutandis,   to  the  payment   obligations  of  the  Lenders)  and  the
Administrative  Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline  Lender the amounts so
received by it from the  Lenders.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  notify the
Borrowers of any  participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this
paragraph and  thereafter  payments in respect of such  Swingline  Loan shall be
made to the  Administrative  Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.  Any amounts
received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or other party on behalf of
the  Borrowers)  in respect of a Swingline  Loan after  receipt by the Swingline
Lender of the  proceeds of a sale of  participations  therein  shall be promptly
remitted  to  the  Administrative  Agent;  any  such  amounts  received  by  the
Administrative  Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative  Agent to
the Lenders that shall have made their  payments  pursuant to this paragraph and
to the  Swingline  Lender,  as their  interests  may  appear.  The  purchase  of
participations  in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve
the Borrowers (or other party liable for  obligations  of the  Borrowers) of any
default in the payment thereof.


         SECTION 2.23. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Each of the Borrowers may
request  the  issuance  of a Letter of  Credit  for its own  account,  in a form
reasonably  acceptable to the Administrative  Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any
time and from time to time  while the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  remain in
effect.  This Section  shall not be construed to impose an  obligation  upon the
Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that is  inconsistent  with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

         (b)  Notice  of  Issuance,   Amendment,   Renewal,  Extension;  Certain
Conditions. In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or to amend,
renew or extend an existing Letter of Credit),  the Borrowers shall hand deliver
or fax to the Issuing Bank and the  Administrative  Agent (reasonably in advance
of the  requested  date of issuance,  amendment,  renewal or extension) a notice
requesting  the  issuance of a Letter of Credit,  or  identifying  the Letter of
Credit to be amended,  renewed or  extended,  the date of  issuance,  amendment,
renewal  or  extension,  the date on which  such  Letter  of Credit is to expire
(which  shall  comply with  paragraph  (c) below),  the amount of such Letter of
Credit,  the  name  and  address  of the  beneficiary  thereof  and  such  other
information as shall be necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit.  A Letter of
Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers


<PAGE>


                                       45


shall be deemed to  represent  and warrant  that,  after  giving  effect to such
issuance,  amendment, renewal or extension (i) the L/C Exposure shall not exceed
$25,000,000  and (ii) the Aggregate  Revolving  Credit Exposure shall not exceed
the lesser of (x) the Total  Revolving  Credit  Commitment and (y) the Borrowing
Base in effect at such time.

         (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of
business on the  earlier of the date one year after the date of the  issuance of
such  Letter of  Credit  and the date that is five  Business  Days  prior to the
Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date,  unless such Letter of Credit  expires by its
terms on an  earlier  date;  provided  that a Letter of Credit may  provide  for
automatic  extension of any expiration date for additional  periods of up to one
year,  subject to a right on the part of the  Issuing  Bank to prevent  any such
automatic   extension  from  occurring  by  giving   reasonable  notice  to  the
beneficiary during a period satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (d)  Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without
any further  action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders,  the Issuing
Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Credit Lender,  and each such Lender hereby
acquires from the  applicable  Issuing Bank, a  participation  in such Letter of
Credit  equal to such  Lender's  Pro Rata  Percentage  of the  aggregate  amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit,  effective  upon the issuance
of such  Letter of Credit (or,  in the case of the  Existing  Letters of Credit,
effective upon the Restatement Date). In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing,  each Revolving Credit Lender hereby  absolutely and  unconditionally
agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank,
such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each L/C  Disbursement  made by the Issuing
Bank and not  reimbursed  by the  Borrowers  (or, if  applicable,  another party
pursuant to its obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date
due as provided in Section 2.02(f).  Each Revolving  Credit Lender  acknowledges
and agrees  that its  obligation  to  acquire  participations  pursuant  to this
paragraph  in respect of Letters of Credit is  absolute  and  unconditional  and
shall not be affected by any circumstance  whatsoever,  including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default,  and that each such payment
shall  be  made  without  any  offset,   abatement,   withholding  or  reduction
whatsoever.

         (e) Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit,  the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative
Agent an amount  equal to such L/C  Disbursement  not later than two hours after
the Borrowers  shall have received  notice from the Issuing Bank that payment of
such draft will be made,  or, if the  Borrowers  shall have received such notice
later than 10:00 a.m.,  New York City time,  on any Business Day, not later than
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day.

         (f) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers'  obligations to reimburse L/C
Disbursements   as  provided  in   paragraph   (e)  above  shall  be   absolute,
unconditional  and  irrevocable,  and shall be performed  strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement,  under any and all  circumstances  whatsoever,
and irrespective of:

                  (i) any lack of  validity or  enforceability  of any Letter of
         Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;

                  (ii) any  amendment  or waiver of or any consent to  departure
         from all or any of the  provisions  of any Letter of Credit or any Loan
         Document;



<PAGE>


                                       46


                  (iii) the  existence  of any claim,  setoff,  defense or other
         right that the Borrowers,  any other party  guaranteeing,  or otherwise
         obligated  with,  the  Borrowers,  any  Subsidiary  or other  Affiliate
         thereof  or  any  other  person  may  at  any  time  have  against  the
         beneficiary  under  any  Letter  of  Credit,   the  Issuing  Bank,  the
         Administrative  Agent or any  Lender or any other  person,  whether  in
         connection  with this  Agreement,  any other Loan Document or any other
         related or unrelated agreement or transaction;

                  (iv) any draft or other document  presented  under a Letter of
         Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
         respect or any  statement  therein  being untrue or  inaccurate  in any
         respect;

                  (v)  payment  by the  Issuing  Bank  under a Letter  of Credit
         against  presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
         with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

                  (vi) any other act or  omission to act or delay of any kind of
         the Issuing Bank, the Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent or any other
         person or any other event or  circumstance  whatsoever,  whether or not
         similar to any of the foregoing,  that might, but for the provisions of
         this  Section,  constitute  a  legal  or  equitable  discharge  of  the
         Borrowers' obligations hereunder.

         Without  limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  it is expressly
understood  and agreed that the absolute  and  unconditional  obligation  of the
Borrowers  hereunder to reimburse L/C  Disbursements  will not be excused by the
gross  negligence  or  wilful  misconduct  of the  Issuing  Bank.  However,  the
foregoing  shall not be construed  to excuse the Issuing Bank from  liability to
the Borrowers to the extent of any direct  damages (as opposed to  consequential
damages,  claims in respect of which are hereby  waived by the  Borrowers to the
extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by
the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct in determining  whether
drafts and other  documents  presented  under a Letter of Credit comply with the
terms thereof;  it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that
appear  on  their  face  to be in  order,  without  responsibility  for  further
investigation,  regardless of any notice or  information to the contrary and, in
making any payment under any Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing  Bank's  exclusive
reliance on the documents  presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any
and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft
presented  under  such  Letter of  Credit,  whether or not the amount due to the
beneficiary  thereunder  equals the amount of such draft and  whether or not any
document  presented  pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient
in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether
or not any other  statement  or any other  document  presented  pursuant to such
Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement  therein proves
to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect  whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance
in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit
with the terms thereof shall,  in each case, be deemed not to constitute  wilful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.

         (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following
its receipt thereof,  examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for
payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible
give telephonic notification,  confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and
the  Borrowers  of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made
or will make an L/C Disbursement  thereunder;  provided that any failure to give
or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve


<PAGE>


                                       47


the  Borrowers  of  their  obligation  to  reimburse  the  Issuing  Bank and the
Revolving  Credit  Lenders  with  respect  to any  such  L/C  Disbursement.  The
Administrative  Agent shall  promptly give each  Revolving  Credit Lender notice
thereof.

         (h)  Interim  Interest.   If  the  Issuing  Bank  shall  make  any  L/C
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit,  then, unless the Borrowers shall
reimburse such L/C  Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount thereof
shall bear interest for the account of the Issuing  Bank,  for each day from and
including the date of such L/C Disbursement, to but excluding the earlier of the
date of payment by the Borrowers or the date on which interest shall commence to
accrue thereon as provided in Section 2.02(f),  at the rate per annum that would
apply to such amount if such amount were an ABR Revolving Loan.

         (i)  Resignation  or Removal of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may
resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative
Agent,  the  Lenders  and the  Borrowers,  and may be removed at any time by the
Borrowers  by notice  to the  Issuing  Bank,  the  Administrative  Agent and the
Lenders.  Subject to the next succeeding  paragraph,  upon the acceptance of any
appointment  as the Issuing Bank hereunder by a Lender that shall agree to serve
as successor  Issuing Bank,  such  successor  shall succeed to and become vested
with all the interests,  rights and obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank and
the retiring  Issuing Bank shall be  discharged  from its  obligations  to issue
additional Letters of Credit hereunder.  At the time such removal or resignation
shall  become  effective,  the  Borrowers  shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees
pursuant  to Section  2.05(c)(ii).  The  acceptance  of any  appointment  as the
Issuing Bank hereunder by a successor  Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement
entered into by such successor,  in a form satisfactory to the Borrowers and the
Administrative  Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement,
(i) such  successor  Lender  shall have all the rights  and  obligations  of the
previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii)
references  herein and in the other Loan  Documents to the term  "Issuing  Bank"
shall be deemed to refer to such  successor or to any previous  Issuing Bank, or
to such successor and all previous  Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.
After the  resignation  or removal of the Issuing Bank  hereunder,  the retiring
Issuing  Bank shall  remain a party  hereto and shall  continue  to have all the
rights and  obligations  of an Issuing Bank under this  Agreement  and the other
Loan  Documents  with  respect to  Letters of Credit  issued by it prior to such
resignation or removal, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of
Credit.

         (j) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing,  the Borrowers  shall,  on the Business Day they receive notice from
the  Administrative  Agent or the  Required  Lenders (or, if the maturity of the
Loans has been accelerated,  Revolving Credit Lenders holding  participations in
outstanding  Letters of Credit  representing  greater than 50% of the  aggregate
undrawn amount of all  outstanding  Letters of Credit) thereof and of the amount
to be  deposited,  deposit  in an account  with the  Collateral  Agent,  for the
benefit  of the  Revolving  Credit  Lenders,  an amount in cash equal to the L/C
Exposure as of such date. Such deposit shall be held by the Collateral  Agent as
collateral for the payment and  performance of the  Obligations.  The Collateral
Agent shall have exclusive  dominion and control,  including the exclusive right
of  withdrawal,  over  such  account.  Other  than any  interest  earned  on the
investment of such deposits in Permitted Investments, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole  discretion of the Collateral  Agent,  such deposits
shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall (i)  automatically  be
applied  by the  Administrative  Agent to  reimburse  the  Issuing  Bank for L/C
Disbursements  for  which  it has not  been  reimbursed,  (ii)  be held  for the
satisfaction  of the  reimbursement  obligations  of the  Borrowers  for the L/C
Exposure at such time and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has


<PAGE>


                                       48


been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Credit Lenders holding
participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing greater than 50% of
the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding  Letters of Credit),  be applied
to satisfy the  Obligations.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount
of cash  collateral  hereunder  as a  result  of the  occurrence  of an Event of
Default,  such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the  Borrowers  within three  Business  Days after all Events of Default have
been cured or waived.

         (k) Additional  Issuing Banks.  The Borrowers may, at any time and from
time to time with the consent of the  Administrative  Agent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender,  designate one or more additional
Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement.  Any Lender
designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (k) shall be deemed (in
addition  to being a Lender) to be the Issuing  Bank with  respect to Letters of
Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender,  and all references  herein and in
the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall,  with respect to such
Letters of Credit,  be deemed to refer to such Lender in its capacity as Issuing
Bank.

         SECTION 2.24. Increase in Term Loan Commitments. (a) The Borrowers may,
by  written  notice  to the  Administrative  Agent  from  time to time,  request
Incremental  Term Loan  Commitments  in an amount not to exceed the  Incremental
Term Loan Amount from one or more  Incremental  Term Lenders,  which may include
any existing Lender;  provided that each Incremental Term Lender, if not already
a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  Each such notice shall set
forth (i) the amount of the Incremental  Term Loan  Commitments  being requested
(which shall be in minimum  increments  of  $5,000,000  and a minimum  amount of
$10,000,000 or equal to the remaining  Incremental  Term Loan Amount),  (ii) the
date on which such  Incremental  Term Loan  Commitments  are requested to become
effective  (which shall not be less than 10 Business  Days nor more than 60 days
after the date of such  notice),  and (iii) whether such  Incremental  Term Loan
Commitments are to be Term Loan Commitments, commitments to make term loans with
the same economic  terms as the Tranche A Term Loans or commitments to make term
loans with economic terms (such as interest rates,  maturities and  amortization
schedules) that are different from the Term Loans ("Other Term Loans").

         (b) The  Borrowers and each  Incremental  Term Lender shall execute and
deliver  to  the  Administrative  Agent  an  Incremental  Term  Loan  Assumption
Agreement  and  such  other  documentation  as the  Administrative  Agent  shall
reasonably  specify to evidence the  Incremental  Term Loan  Commitment  of such
Incremental Term Lender.  Each Incremental Term Loan Assumption  Agreement shall
specify the terms of the Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder;  provided
that,  without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders,  (i) the final
maturity  date of any Other Term Loans  shall be no earlier  than the  Tranche B
Maturity  Date and (ii) the  average  life to  maturity  of any Other Term Loans
shall be no shorter  than the  average  life to  maturity  of the Tranche B Term
Loans.  The  Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  notify each Lender as to the
effectiveness of each Incremental  Term Loan Assumption  Agreement.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that,  upon the  effectiveness  of any  Incremental
Term Loan  Assumption  Agreement,  this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the
extent (but only to the extent)  necessary to reflect the existence and terms of
the Incremental Term Loan Commitment evidenced thereby.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no Incremental Term Loan Commitment
shall  become  effective  under this Section 2.24 unless (i) on the date of such
effectiveness, the


<PAGE>


                                       49


conditions  set  forth  in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of  Section  4.01  shall  be
satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that
effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrowers, and
(ii) the  Administrative  Agent shall have received (with sufficient  copies for
each of the Incremental Term Lenders) legal opinions,  board  resolutions and an
officer's  certificate  consistent with those delivered on the Restatement  Date
under paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 4.02.

         (d) Each of the parties  hereto hereby  agrees that the  Administrative
Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably  necessary to ensure that
all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans),  when originally made,
are included in each Borrowing of outstanding  Tranche A Term Loans or Tranche B
Term Loans, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis. This may be accomplished at
the  discretion  of the  Administrative  Agent  by  requiring  each  outstanding
Eurodollar Tranche A Term Borrowing or Eurodollar  Tranche B Term Borrowing,  as
the case may be, to be converted  into an ABR Term Borrowing on the date of each
Incremental  Term Loan, or by allocating a portion of each Incremental Term Loan
to each outstanding  Eurodollar Tranche A Term Borrowing or Eurodollar Tranche B
Term  Borrowing,  as  applicable,  on a pro rata basis,  even though as a result
thereof  such  Incremental  Term Loan may  effectively  have a shorter  Interest
Period than the Term Loans  included in the  Borrowing  of which they are a part
(and  notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement that would prohibit
such an initial Interest Period). Any conversion of Eurodollar Term Loans to ABR
Term Loans required by the preceding  sentence shall be subject to Section 2.16.
If any Incremental  Term Loan is to be allocated to an existing  Interest Period
for a Eurodollar Term Borrowing then, subject to Section 2.07, the interest rate
applicable  to such  Incremental  Term Loan for the  remainder of such  Interest
Period shall equal the Adjusted  LIBO Rate for a period  approximately  equal to
the remainder of such Interest Period (as determined by the Administrative Agent
two Business Days before the date such  Incremental  Term Loan is made) plus the
Applicable Percentage. In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are
not  Other  Term  Loans,  the  scheduled  amortization  payments  under  Section
2.11(a)(i) or (ii), as applicable,  required to be made after the making of such
Incremental  Term Loans  shall be ratably  increased  to reflect  the  aggregate
principal   amount  of  such   Incremental   Term  Loans.  In  such  event,  the
Administrative  Agent shall  prepare and  distribute  to the  Borrowers  and the
Lenders  an updated  amortization  schedule  which  shall be  conclusive  absent
manifest error.

         SECTION  2.25.  Increase  in  Revolving  Credit  Commitments.  (a)  The
Borrowers may, by written notice to the  Administrative  Agent from time to time
after the Restatement Date, request Incremental  Revolving Credit Commitments in
an amount not to exceed the Incremental  Revolving Credit Commitment Amount from
one or more Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders, which may include any existing
Lender; provided that each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender, if not already a
Revolving  Credit  Lender  hereunder,  shall be subject to the  approval  of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which approvals
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  Each such notice shall set forth (i) the
amount of the Incremental  Revolving Credit  Commitments  being requested (which
shall be in minimum  increments of $1,000,000 and a minimum amount of $5,000,000
or equal to the remaining  Incremental  Revolving Credit Commitment  Amount) and
(ii)  the  date on which  such  Incremental  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  are
requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business Days nor
more than 60 days after the date of such notice).

         (b) The Borrowers and each  Incremental  Revolving  Credit Lender shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental  Revolving Credit
Assumption  Agreement and such other  documentation as the Administrative  Agent
shall reasonably specify to


<PAGE>


                                       50


evidence  the  Incremental  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  of  such  Incremental
Revolving  Credit Lender.  The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender as to the  effectiveness of each Incremental  Revolving Credit Assumption
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness
of any Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption  Agreement,  this Agreement shall
be deemed  amended to the extent (but only to the extent)  necessary  to reflect
the existence and terms of the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment evidenced
thereby.

         (c) Each of the parties  hereto hereby  agrees that the  Administrative
Agent may take any and all  actions  as may be  reasonably  necessary  to ensure
that,  after  giving  effect  to any  Incremental  Revolving  Credit  Commitment
pursuant to this Section 2.25, the outstanding Revolving Loans (if any) are held
by  the  Revolving  Credit  Lenders  in  accordance  with  their  new  Pro  Rata
Percentages.  This may be accomplished  at the discretion of the  Administrative
Agent (i) by requiring the  outstanding  Revolving  Loans to be prepaid with the
proceeds of a new  Revolving  Credit  Borrowing,  (ii) by causing  the  existing
Revolving Credit Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding Revolving Loans
to  Incremental  Revolving  Credit  Lenders,  (iii) by permitting  the Revolving
Credit Borrowings outstanding at the time of any increase in the Total Revolving
Credit Commitment  pursuant to this Section 2.25 to remain outstanding until the
last days of the respective Interest Periods therefor, even though the Revolving
Credit  Lenders  would  hold such  Revolving  Credit  Borrowings  other  than in
accordance  with their new Pro Rata  Percentages,  or (iv) by any combination of
the  foregoing.  Any  prepayment or assignment  described in this  paragraph (c)
shall be subject to  indemnification  by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.16,
but otherwise without premium or penalty.

         (d)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  no Incremental  Revolving  Credit
Commitment  shall become effective under this Section 2.25 unless on the date of
such  effectiveness,  the  conditions  set  forth in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of
Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received
a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer
of the Borrowers.

         SECTION 2.26.  Extension of Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date.  (a) The
Borrowers may, by notice (an "Extension  Request") to the  Administrative  Agent
(which shall promptly  deliver a copy to each of the Revolving  Credit  Lenders)
not less than 30 days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date then in effect
(the "Existing  Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date"),  request that the Revolving
Credit Lenders extend the Existing  Revolving  Credit Maturity Date to a date no
later than the Tranche B Maturity  Date and  specified by the  Borrowers in such
notice.  Each Revolving  Credit Lender shall, by notice to the Borrowers and the
Administrative  Agent  given not more than 15 days  after  receipt  by it of the
Extension  Request,  advise the  Borrowers  whether or not such Lender agrees to
such extension (and any Lender that does not so advise the Borrowers on or prior
to such date shall be deemed not to have agreed to such extension). The decision
to agree or withhold agreement to any extension of the Existing Revolving Credit
Maturity Date hereunder shall be at the sole discretion of each Revolving Credit
Lender.

         (b) If any  Extension  Request  shall  not have been  approved  by each
Revolving Credit Lender (each such Lender,  a "Non-Extending  Lender") but shall
have been approved by Revolving  Credit Lenders  holding a majority of the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment (whether used or unused), then the Borrowers may (i)
cause  one or more  Non-Extending  Lenders  to  assign  their  Revolving  Credit
Commitments  in  accordance   with  Section   2.21(a)  and/or  (ii)  prepay  the
outstanding Revolving Loans of one or more Non-Extending Lenders,  together with
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and permanently terminate the Revolving


<PAGE>


                                       51


Credit Commitment of such Non-Extending Lenders (provided that the Borrowers may
not so terminate  Revolving Credit  Commitments to the extent that, after giving
effect thereto,  the Aggregate  Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment).

         (c) If (and only if) each of the Revolving Credit Lenders (after giving
effect to any assignments and terminations of Commitments  pursuant to paragraph
(b) above) shall have agreed to extend the Existing  Revolving  Credit  Maturity
Date,  then the Revolving  Credit Maturity Date shall be extended to the date so
requested by the Borrowers in the Extension Request.

         (d) The proposed effectiveness of any extension of the Revolving Credit
Maturity  Date  provided for in this Section 2.26 shall be deemed to be a Credit
Event for all  purposes of this  Agreement  and it shall be a further  condition
precedent  to such  effectiveness  that  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have
received a certificate,  dated the Existing  Revolving  Credit Maturity Date and
signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrowers,  confirming  compliance with the
conditions precedent set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.01.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

         The Borrowers  represent and warrant to the  Administrative  Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders that:

         SECTION  3.01.  Organization;  Powers.  The  Borrower  and  each of the
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the  jurisdiction of its  organization,  (b) has all requisite power
and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted and as proposed to be  conducted,  (c) is qualified to do business in,
and is in good  standing  in, every  jurisdiction  where such  qualification  is
required,  except  where the  failure  so to  qualify  could not  reasonably  be
expected  to  result in a  Material  Adverse  Effect,  and (d) has the power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Loan
Documents and each other agreement or instrument  contemplated hereby or thereby
to which it is or will be a party and, in the case of the  Borrowers,  to borrow
hereunder.

         SECTION 3.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by
(a) the  Borrower of the Purchase  Agreement  and (b) each Loan Party of each of
the Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement and the Loan Documents  (including the borrowings  hereunder)
(collectively,  the  "Transactions")  (i)  have  been  duly  authorized  by  all
requisite  corporate and, if required,  stockholder action and (ii) will not (x)
violate (A) any material  provision of law, statute,  rule or regulation,  or of
the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constitutive  documents or
by-laws of the  Borrower or any  Subsidiary,  (B) any order of any  Governmental
Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture or any other material  agreement
or other  instrument  to which the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  is a party or by
which  any of  them  or any of  their  property  is or may be  bound,  (y) be in
conflict  with,  result in a breach of or  constitute  (alone or with  notice or
lapse of time or both) a default under,  or give rise to any right to accelerate
or to require the prepayment,  repurchase or redemption of any obligation  under
any such indenture,  agreement or other instrument or (z) result in the creation
or  imposition  of any Lien upon or with  respect to any  property or assets now
owned or hereafter acquired by the


<PAGE>


                                       52


Borrower or any Subsidiary  (other than any Lien created  hereunder or under the
Security Documents).

         SECTION 3.03. Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the  Borrowers and  constitutes,  and each other Loan Document when
executed and  delivered by each Loan Party  thereto  will  constitute,  a legal,
valid and binding  obligation of such Loan Party  enforceable  against such Loan
Party in accordance with its terms except as such  enforceability may be limited
by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  fraudulent  conveyance,  reorganization  and other
similar laws relating to or affecting  creditors'  rights  generally and general
equitable principles.

         SECTION 3.04. Governmental Approvals; Contracts. (a) No action, consent
or  approval  of,  registration  or  filing  with  or any  other  action  by any
Governmental   Authority  is  or  will  be  required  in  connection   with  the
Transactions,  except for (i) the filing of Uniform  Commercial  Code  financing
statements,  filings  pursuant to the  Assignment of Claims Act and filings with
the United States  Copyright  Office,  in each case with respect to the personal
property  to be  acquired  in the  Acquisition,  (ii)  such as have been made or
obtained  and are in full force and effect  and (iii)  such  actions,  consents,
approvals,  registrations  or  filings,  the  failure of which to make or obtain
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) No notice of suspension,  debarment of termination  for default has
been received by the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  and no cure notice (other than
any immaterial cure notice under any General Services  Administration  contract)
has been  received by the  Borrower or any  Subsidiary  in  connection  with any
Government  Contract or other  contract  pursuant  to which the  Borrower or any
Subsidiary  is  directly or  indirectly  acting as a  subcontractor  under or in
connection with a Government  Contract.  All Government Contracts that as of the
Restatement Date constitute  Material Contracts are listed on Schedule 3.04, and
documentation  necessary for  compliance  with the  Assignment of Claims Act has
been executed and delivered by the Borrower or any  Subsidiary,  as  applicable,
with  respect to each  Government  Contract for which  Assignment  of Claims Act
perfection  is  currently  being  required  by the Lenders (as noted on Schedule
3.04).

         SECTION 3.05.  Financial  Statements.  (a) The Borrower has  heretofore
furnished  to the Lenders its  consolidated  balance  sheets and  statements  of
income,  stockholder's  equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal  year
ended December 31, 2001,  audited by and accompanied by the opinion of KPMG LLP,
independent  public  accountants,  and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and
the  portion of the fiscal  year ended  June 30,  2002,  certified  by its chief
financial  officer.  Such  financial  statements  present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of the
Borrower  and its  consolidated  Subsidiaries  as of  such  dates  and for  such
periods.  Such  balance  sheets  and the notes  thereto  disclose  all  material
liabilities,  direct  or  contingent,  of  the  Borrower  and  its  consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof. Such financial statements were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

         (b) The Borrower has heretofore  delivered to the Lenders its unaudited
pro forma  consolidated  balance sheet and  statements of income,  stockholder's
equity  and cash  flows as of June  30,  2002,  prepared  giving  effect  to the
Transactions  as if they had occurred,  with respect to such balance  sheet,  on
such date and, with respect to such other financial statements, on the first day
of the 12-month period ending on such date. Such pro forma financial  statements
have been prepared in good faith by the Borrower,  based on the assumptions used
to prepare the pro forma financial information contained in the


<PAGE>


                                       53


Confidential  Information  Memorandum  (which  assumptions at the time made were
believed by the Borrower to be reasonable),  were based on the best  information
available to the Borrower as of the date of delivery thereof, accurately reflect
all  adjustments  required  to be made to give  effect to the  Transactions  and
present  fairly in all  material  respects  on a pro forma  basis the  estimated
consolidated   financial   position  of  the  Borrower   and  its   consolidated
Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period, assuming that the Transactions
had actually  occurred at such date or at the  beginning of such period,  as the
case may be.

         SECTION 3.06. No Material  Adverse  Change.  There has been no material
adverse  change in the  business,  results of  operations,  property,  condition
(financial  or  otherwise)  or prospects  of the Borrower and the  Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, since December 31, 2001.

         SECTION 3.07. Title to Properties; Possession Under Leases. (a) Each of
the Borrower and the  Subsidiaries  has good and  marketable  title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all its material properties and assets, except for minor
defects in title that do not interfere  with its ability to conduct its business
as  currently  conducted  or to  utilize  such  properties  and assets for their
intended purposes. All such material properties and assets are free and clear of
Liens, other than Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

         (b) Each of the Borrower  and the  Subsidiaries  has complied  with all
obligations under all material leases to which it is a party and all such leases
are in full force and effect.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries  enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.

         SECTION  3.08.  Subsidiaries.  Schedule  3.08  sets  forth  as  of  the
Restatement  Date a list  of  all  Subsidiaries  and  the  percentage  ownership
interest of the Borrower therein. The shares of capital stock or other ownership
interests  so  indicated  on  Schedule  3.08 and,  on and after the  Acquisition
Closing  Date the shares of capital  stock or other  ownership  interests of the
Target and its subsidiaries are fully paid and  non-assessable  and are owned by
the Borrower,  directly or  indirectly,  free and clear of all Liens (other than
Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents).

         SECTION 3.09. Litigation;  Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth on
Schedule  3.09,  there are not any actions,  suits or  proceedings  at law or in
equity  or by or  before  any  Governmental  Authority  now  pending  or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower,  threatened  against or affecting the Borrower or any
Subsidiary  or any  business,  property  or rights of any such  person  (i) that
involve  any Loan  Document or the  Transactions  or (ii) as to which there is a
reasonable  possibility  of an  adverse  determination  and that,  if  adversely
determined,  could reasonably be expected,  individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION  3.10.  Agreements.   None  of  the  Borrower  or  any  of  the
Subsidiaries is in default in any manner under any provision of any indenture or
other agreement or instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any Material Contract,
where such default could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.11. Federal Reserve Regulations.  (a) None of the Borrower or
any of the  Subsidiaries  is  engaged  principally,  or as one of its  important
activities,  in the  business of  extending  credit for the purpose of buying or
carrying Margin Stock.

         (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of Credit will be
used, whether directly or indirectly,  and whether immediately,  incidentally or
ultimately, for any purpose


<PAGE>


                                       54


that entails a violation of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the
Regulations of the Board, including Regulation T, U or X.

         SECTION 3.12.  Investment  Company Act;  Public Utility Holding Company
Act. None of the Borrower or any  Subsidiary is (a) an  "investment  company" as
defined in, or subject to regulation  under, the Investment  Company Act of 1940
or (b) a "holding  company" as defined in, or subject to regulation  under,  the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         SECTION 3.13.  Use of Proceeds.  The Borrowers will use the proceeds of
the Loans and will  request  the  issuance  of  Letters  of Credit  only for the
purposes specified in the preamble to this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.14.  Tax Returns.  Each of the Borrower and the  Subsidiaries
has filed or  caused  to be filed all  Federal,  state,  local and  foreign  tax
returns or materials required to have been filed by it and has paid or caused to
be paid all material  taxes due and payable by it and all  material  assessments
received  by it,  except  taxes  that  are  being  contested  in good  faith  by
appropriate  proceedings  and for  which the  Borrower  or such  Subsidiary,  as
applicable, shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves.

         SECTION 3.15. No Material  Misstatements.  None of (a) the Confidential
Information  Memorandum  or  (b)  any  other  information,   report,   financial
statement,  exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection  with the  negotiation  of any
Loan  Document or included  therein or  delivered  pursuant  thereto  contained,
contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or omitted,  omits or
will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the  statements  therein,
in the light of the  circumstances  under which they were,  are or will be made,
not  misleading;  provided  that to the  extent  any such  information,  report,
financial  statement,  exhibit  or  schedule  was based  upon or  constitutes  a
forecast or projection, the Borrower represents only that it acted in good faith
and utilized  reasonable  assumptions  and due care in the  preparation  of such
information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule.

         SECTION 3.16.  Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Each of the Borrower and its
ERISA  Affiliates is in compliance in all material  respects with the applicable
provisions   of  ERISA  and  the  Code  and  the   regulations   and   published
interpretations  thereunder.  No  ERISA  Event  has  occurred  or is  reasonably
expected to occur that,  when taken  together  with all other such ERISA Events,
could reasonably be expected to result in material  liability of the Borrower or
any of its ERISA Affiliates.  The present value of all benefit liabilities under
each Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan) did not, as of the
last annual  valuation date applicable  thereto,  exceed by more than $3,000,000
the fair market value of the assets of such Plan,  and the present  value of all
benefit liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to
fund each such Plan) did not, as of the last annual  valuation dates  applicable
thereto,  exceed by more than  $3,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of
all such underfunded Plans.

         (b) Each Foreign Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with all requirements of law applicable thereto and the respective  requirements
of  the   governing   documents   for  such  plan  except  to  the  extent  such
non-compliance  could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  With respect to each Foreign  Pension Plan,  none of the Borrower,  its
Affiliates or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents has engaged in
a transaction that subjects the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly,  to a material  tax or civil  penalty.  With respect to each Foreign
Pension Plan,


<PAGE>


                                       55


reserves  have been  established  in the financial  statements  furnished to the
Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law
and prudent  business  practice or, where required,  in accordance with ordinary
accounting  practices in the  jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension Plan is
maintained.  The aggregate  unfunded  liabilities,  with respect to such Foreign
Pension Plans could not  reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse
Effect.  There are no actions,  suits or claims  (other than routine  claims for
benefits)  pending or threatened  against the Borrower or any of its  Affiliates
with  respect to any Foreign  Pension  Plan that could  reasonably  be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.17. Environmental Matters.  Except as set forth in Schedule
3.17:

         (a)  The  properties   owned  or  operated  by  the  Borrower  and  the
Subsidiaries  (the  "Properties")  do not contain  any  Hazardous  Materials  in
amounts or concentrations  which (i) constitute,  or constituted a violation of,
(ii) require Remedial Action under, or (iii) could give rise to liability under,
Environmental Laws, which violations,  Remedial Actions and liabilities,  in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

         (b)  The  Properties  and  all  operations  of  the  Borrower  and  the
Subsidiaries  are  in  compliance,  and in the  last  six  years  have  been  in
compliance,  with all Environmental Laws and all necessary Environmental Permits
have  been  obtained  and  are  in  effect,  except  to  the  extent  that  such
non-compliance  or failure to obtain any necessary  permits,  in the  aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

         (c) There have been no Releases or threatened  Releases at, from, under
or proximate to the Properties or otherwise in connection with the operations of
the Borrower or the Subsidiaries,  which Releases or threatened Releases, in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

         (d) None of the  Borrower or any of the  Subsidiaries  has received any
notice  of an  Environmental  Claim in  connection  with the  Properties  or the
operations  of the  Borrower  or the  Subsidiaries  or with regard to any person
whose liabilities for environmental matters the Borrower or the Subsidiaries has
retained or assumed, in whole or in part, contractually,  by operation of law or
otherwise,  which, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect,  nor do the Borrower or the Subsidiaries have reason to
believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened; and

         (e) Hazardous  Materials have not been transported from the Properties,
nor have Hazardous Materials been generated,  treated, stored or disposed of at,
on or under any of the  Properties in a manner that could give rise to liability
under any Environmental Law, nor have the Borrower or the Subsidiaries  retained
or assumed any liability,  contractually, by operation of law or otherwise, with
respect  to  the  generation,   treatment,  storage  or  disposal  of  Hazardous
Materials, which transportation,  generation, treatment, storage or disposal, or
retained or assumed liabilities,  in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

correct  description  of all  insurance  maintained  by the  Borrower  or by the
Borrower for its Subsidiaries as of the Restatement  Date. As of the Restatement
Date, such insurance is in full force and effect and all premiums have been duly
paid. The Borrower and its


<PAGE>


                                       56


Subsidiaries  have  insurance  in such  amounts  and  covering  such  risks  and
liabilities as are in accordance with normal industry practice.

         SECTION 3.19. Security Documents. (a) The Pledge Agreement is effective
to create in favor of the  Collateral  Agent,  for the  ratable  benefit  of the
Secured  Parties,  a legal,  valid  and  enforceable  security  interest  in the
Collateral  (as defined in the Pledge  Agreement)  and,  when the  Collateral is
delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a fully
perfected first priority Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
interest of the pledgors  thereunder in such Collateral,  in each case prior and
superior in right to any other person.

         (b) The  Security  Agreement  is  effective  to  create in favor of the
Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid
and enforceable  security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement) and, (i) assuming that financing  statements in appropriate form have
been filed in the offices  specified in Section  3.19(b) of the Existing  Credit
Agreement,  and (ii) when financing  statements in appropriate form are filed in
the  offices  specified  on  Schedule  3.19(b),  the  Security  Agreement  shall
constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title
and  interest of the  grantors  thereunder  in such  Collateral  (other than the
Intellectual Property, as defined in the Security Agreement), in each case prior
and  superior  in right to any other  person,  other than with  respect to Liens
expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

         (c) Assuming  that the Security  Agreement has been filed in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright  Office,  the
Security  Agreement  shall  constitute a fully  perfected  Lien on, and security
interest in, all right,  title and interest of the  grantors  thereunder  in the
Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement), in each case prior
and superior in right to any other person (it being  understood  that subsequent
recordings  in the  United  States  Patent and  Trademark  Office and the United
States  Copyright  Office  may be  necessary  to  perfect  a lien on  registered
trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights acquired by the grantors after
the date hereof).

         SECTION 3.20. Location of Real Property. Schedule 3.20 lists completely
and correctly as of the Restatement Date all real property owned by the Borrower
and  the  Subsidiaries  and  the  addresses   thereof.   The  Borrower  and  the
Subsidiaries own in fee all the real property set forth on Schedule 3.20.

         SECTION 3.21. Labor Matters.  As of the Restatement  Date, there are no
strikes,  lockouts or slowdowns  against the Borrower or any Subsidiary  pending
or, to the  knowledge  of the  Borrower,  threatened.  The  hours  worked by and
payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in
violation  of the Fair  Labor  Standards  Act or any other  applicable  Federal,
state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the
Borrower  or any  Subsidiary,  or for which any  claim may be made  against  the
Borrower or any Subsidiary,  on account of wages and employee health and welfare
insurance  and other  benefits,  have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or such  Subsidiary.  The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to any right of termination or right of  renegotiation on the
part of any  union  under  any  collective  bargaining  agreement  to which  the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

         SECTION  3.22.  Solvency.  Immediately  after the  consummation  of the
Transactions  to occur on the  Restatement  Date and  immediately  following the
making of each Loan and after giving effect to the  application  of the proceeds
of each Loan,  (a) the fair value of the  assets of each Loan  Party,  at a fair
valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities,


<PAGE>


                                       57


subordinated,  contingent or otherwise;  (b) the present fair saleable  value of
the  property  of each Loan Party will be greater  than the amount  that will be
required  to pay the  probable  liability  of its debts  and other  liabilities,
subordinated,  contingent  or  otherwise,  as such  debts and other  liabilities
become  absolute and matured;  (c) each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts
and  liabilities,  subordinated,  contingent  or  otherwise,  as such  debts and
liabilities  become absolute and matured;  and (d) each Loan Party will not have

Investments of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries shall not exceed $20,000,000.

suspend collection of the contested  obligation,  tax,  assessment or charge and

transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and in order to grant, preserve,
protect and perfect the  validity and first  priority of the security  interests

interests  and Liens  will be created  under the  Security  Documents  and other
security  agreements,  mortgages,  deeds  of trust  and  other  instruments  and
documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent,
and the Borrower  shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Lenders all such
instruments and documents  (including legal opinions,  title insurance  policies
and lien searches) as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably  request to evidence
compliance  with this Section.  The Borrower  agrees to provide such evidence as
the Collateral Agent shall reasonably  request as to the perfection and priority
status of each such security interest and Lien. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Borrower  will give prompt  notice to the Agents of the  acquisition  by the
Borrower or any  Domestic  Subsidiary  of any real  property (or any interest in
real property) having a value in excess of $750,000.

the  retiring  Agent may, on behalf of the  Lenders,  appoint a successor  Agent
(with the consent of the Borrowers, not to be unreasonably withheld) which shall
be a bank with an office in New York,  New York,  having a combined  capital and
surplus of at least  $500,000,000  or an  Affiliate  of any such bank.  Upon the
acceptance  of any  appointment  as Agent  hereunder by a successor  bank,  such
successor  shall  succeed  to and become  vested  with all the  rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the  retiring  Agent and the  retiring  Agent shall be
discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations  hereunder.  After  the  Agent's
resignation  hereunder,  the  provisions  of this Article and Section 9.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

         With  respect  to the Loans  made by it  hereunder,  each  Agent in its
individual  capacity  and not as Agent  shall have the same rights and powers as
any other Lender and may  exercise the same as though it were not an Agent,  and
the Agents and their  Affiliates  may accept  deposits  from,  lend money to and
generally  engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent.

         Each  Lender  agrees (a) to  reimburse  the Agents,  on demand,  in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on the aggregate  amount of its  outstanding
Term Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments  hereunder) of any expenses incurred
for the  benefit  of the  Lenders  by the  Agents,  including  counsel  fees and
compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the
Lenders,  that  shall  not have  been  reimbursed  by the  Borrowers  and (b) to
indemnify  and hold  harmless  each  Agent and any of its  directors,  officers,
employees or agents,  on demand,  in the amount of such pro rata share, from and
against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or  disbursements  of any kind or
nature  whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in
its  capacity  as Agent or any of them in any way  relating to or arising out of
this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document or any action taken or omitted by it
or any of them under this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  to the extent
the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party,
provided  that  no  Lender  shall  be  liable  to an  Agent  or any  such  other
indemnified  person for any portion of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
are determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction by final and  nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Agent or any of its  directors,  officers,  employees or agents.  Each Revolving
Credit Lender agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank and its directors,  employees
and agents, in each case, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations
as provided above for the Agents.

         Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  it  has,  independently  and  without
reliance  upon the Agents or any other  Lender and based on such  documents  and
information  as it has  deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis  and
decision to enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also  acknowledges  that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and
based on such  documents  and  information  as it shall  from  time to time deem
appropriate,  continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this  Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document,  any  related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

made by or on behalf of the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent,  any
Lender or the Issuing Bank.

         SECTION 9.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement  shall become  effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrowers and the  Administrative  Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together,  bear the signatures of the Restatement  Required  Lenders,
and thereafter  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers,

include the permitted  successors and assigns of such party;  and all covenants,
promises and  agreements by or on behalf of the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative
Agent,  the Issuing  Bank or the Lenders that are  contained  in this  Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.

         (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its interests,  rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including all or a
portion of its  Commitments  and the Loans at the time  owing to it);  provided,
however,  that  (i)  except  in the  case of an  assignment  to a  Lender  or an
Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender,  (x) the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent (and, in the case of any assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment,  the
Issuing Bank and the Swingline  Lender) must give their prior written consent to
such assignment  (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed);
provided,  however,  that the consent of the Borrowers  shall not be required to
any such assignment  during the continuance of any Event of Default described in
subsection  (g) or (h) of Article VII, and (y) the amount of the  Commitment  or
Loan of the assigning  Lender subject to each such assignment  (determined as of
the date the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with  respect to such  assignment  is
delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000,  if in
respect of a Revolving Credit Commitment or a Revolving Loan, or $1,000,000,  if
in respect of a Term Loan  Commitment  or a Term Loan (or,  if less,  the entire
remaining amount of such Lender's  applicable  Commitment) or such lesser amount
as the Borrowers and the Administrative  Agent may from time to time agree (such
agreement  to  be  conclusively  evidenced  by  the  execution  of  the  related
Assignment and Acceptance by all the parties thereto),  (ii) the parties to each
such  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance,  together (except in the case of any assignment to an
Affiliate or a Related Fund) with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and
(iii)  the  assignee,  if it  shall  not  be a  Lender,  shall  deliver  to  the
Administrative  Agent  an  Administrative  Questionnaire.  Upon  acceptance  and
recording  pursuant to paragraph  (e) of this Section  9.04,  from and after the
effective date specified in each  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  (A) the assignee
thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest  assigned
by such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this  Agreement  and (B) the assigning  Lender  thereunder  shall,  to the
extent of the interest  assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,  be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party
hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16,
2.20 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid).

         (c) By executing  and  delivering  an Assignment  and  Acceptance,  the

<PAGE>


                                       84


each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) such  assigning  Lender
warrants  that it is the  legal  and  beneficial  owner  of the  interest  being
assigned  thereby  free and  clear of any  adverse  claim and that its Term Loan
Commitment and Revolving Credit Commitment,  and the outstanding balances of its
Term  Loans  and  Revolving  Loans,  in  each  case  without  giving  effect  to
assignments  thereof which have not become  effective,  are as set forth in such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning
Lender makes no representation  or warranty and assumes no  responsibility  with
respect  to  any  statements,  warranties  or  representations  made  in  or  in
connection  with  this  Agreement,   or  the  execution,   legality,   validity,
enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document  furnished pursuant hereto, or
the financial  condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or
observance  by the Borrower or any  Subsidiary of any of its  obligations  under
this  Agreement,  any other Loan  Document or any other  instrument  or document
furnished pursuant hereto;  (iii) such assignee  represents and warrants that it
is legally  authorized to enter into such Assignment and  Acceptance;  (iv) such
assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,  together with
copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.05(a) or
delivered  pursuant to Section 5.04 and such other  documents and information as
it has deemed  appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance;  (v) such assignee will  independently  and
without  reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent,  such
assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall  deem  appropriate  at the  time,  continue  to make its own  credit
decisions  in  taking or not  taking  action  under  this  Agreement;  (vi) such
assignee  appoints and  authorizes the  Administrative  Agent and the Collateral
Agent to take such  action as agent on its behalf and to  exercise  such  powers
under  this  Agreement  as are  delegated  to the  Administrative  Agent and the
Collateral Agent,  respectively,  by the terms hereof, together with such powers
as are reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vii) such assignee  agrees that it
will perform in  accordance  with their terms all the  obligations  which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

         (d) The  Administrative  Agent,  acting for this purpose as an agent of
the  Borrowers,  shall  maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each  Assignment and  Acceptance  delivered to it and a register for the
recordation  of the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the  Commitment of,
and  principal  amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender  pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and the Borrowers,  the  Administrative  Agent, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for  inspection by the  Borrowers,  the Issuing Bank,  the  Collateral
Agent  and any  Lender,  at any  reasonable  time  and  from  time to time  upon
reasonable prior notice.

         (e) Upon its  receipt of a duly  completed  Assignment  and  Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire
completed in respect of the assignee  (unless the  assignee  shall  already be a
Lender  hereunder),  the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) above and, if required, the written consent of the Borrowers,  the Swingline
Lender,  the Issuing Bank and the Administrative  Agent to such assignment,  the
Administrative  Agent shall (i) accept such  Assignment  and Acceptance and (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be
effective  unless it has been  recorded  in the  Register  as  provided  in this
paragraph (e).

                                       85


         (f) Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrowers, the Swingline
Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative  Agent sell participations to one
or  more  banks  or  other  entities  in all or a  portion  of  its  rights  and
obligations  under this Agreement  (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and  the  Loans  owing  to  it);  provided,  however,  that  (i)  such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto for the  performance of
such  obligations,  (iii) the  participating  banks or other  entities  shall be
entitled to the benefit of the cost protection  provisions contained in Sections
2.14,  2.16  and 2.20 and  shall  be  bound  by the  confidentiality  provisions
contained  in Section  9.16 to the same extent as if they were  Lenders and (iv)
the Borrowers,  the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender in  connection  with such
Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  and such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce the  obligations  of the Borrowers  relating to
the Loans or L/C  Disbursements  and to approve any amendment,  modification  or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments,  modifications
or waivers  decreasing any fees payable  hereunder or the amount of principal of
or the rate at which  interest is payable on the Loans,  extending any scheduled
principal  payment  date or date fixed for the payment of interest on the Loans,
increasing or extending the  Commitments or releasing all or  substantially  all
the Guarantors or the  Collateral).  All amounts payable by the Borrowers to any
Lender  hereunder  in  respect  of any  Loan and the  applicability  of the cost
protection  provisions  contained  in  Section  2.14,  2.16  and  2.20  shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold or agreed to sell any participation in
such Loan, and as if such Lender were funding the  participated  portion of such
Loan the  same  way that it is  funding  the  portion  of such  Loan in which no
participation has been sold.

         (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed  assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section
9.04,   disclose  to  the  assignee  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee  or
participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by
or on behalf of the Borrower;  provided  that,  prior to any such  disclosure of
information  designated by the Borrower as  confidential,  each such assignee or
participant  or proposed  assignee or  participant  shall  execute an  agreement
whereby  such  assignee  or  participant   shall  agree  (subject  to  customary
exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential  information on
terms no less  restrictive  than those  applicable  to the  Lenders  pursuant to
Section 9.16.

         (h) Any Lender may at any time  assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure extensions of credit to such Lender or in support
of  obligations  owed by such Lender;  provided  that no such  assignment  shall
release a Lender from any of its  obligations  hereunder or substitute  any such
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         (i)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  herein,  any
Lender (a "Granting  Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC"),  identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting  Lender
to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Borrowers,  the  option to provide to the
Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting  Lender would otherwise
be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement;  provided that
(i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and
(ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise  fails to provide
all or any part of such Loan,  the  Granting  Lender  shall be obligated to make
such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder
shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting  Lender to the same extent,  and as
if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that no SPC shall be liable  for any  indemnity  or similar  payment  obligation
under this Agreement (all liability for which shall


<PAGE>


                                       86


remain with the Granting  Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing,  each party
hereto hereby  agrees (which  agreement  shall survive the  termination  of this
Agreement)  that,  prior to the date  that is one  year  and one day  after  the
payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness
of any  SPC,  it will  not  institute  against,  or join  any  other  person  in
instituting  against,  such  SPC any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof. In addition,  notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained
in this  Section  9.04,  any SPC may (i) with  notice to, but  without the prior
written  consent  of, the  Borrowers  and the  Administrative  Agent and without
paying any processing fee therefor,  assign all or a portion of its interests in
any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions  (consented to
by the Borrowers and  Administrative  Agent)  providing  liquidity and/or credit
support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or  maintenance
of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential  basis any  non-public  information
relating to its Loans to any rating agency,  commercial paper dealer or provider
of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

         (j) The  Borrowers  shall not assign or delegate any of their rights or
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative  Agent,
the Issuing  Bank and each Lender,  and any  attempted  assignment  without such
consent shall be null and void.

         (k) In the event  that  S&P,  Moody's,  and  Thompson's  BankWatch  (or
InsuranceWatch  Ratings  Service,  in the case of  Lenders  that  are  insurance
companies (or Best's Insurance  Reports,  if such insurance company is not rated
by  Insurance  Watch  Ratings  Service))  shall,  after the date that any Lender
becomes a Revolving Credit Lender,  downgrade the long-term  certificate deposit
ratings of such Lender,  and the resulting ratings shall be below BBB-, Baa3 and
C (or BB, in the case of a Lender  that is an  insurance  company  (or B, in the
case of an insurance company not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)), then
the  Issuing  Bank  shall  have the right,  but not the  obligation,  at its own
expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to replace (or
to request the Borrower to use its  reasonable  efforts to replace)  such Lender
with an assignee (in accordance with and subject to the  restrictions  contained
in paragraph  (b) above),  and such Lender  hereby agrees to transfer and assign
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the  restrictions  contained
in paragraph (b) above) all its interests,  rights and obligations in respect of
its Revolving Credit Commitment to such assignee; provided, however, that (i) no
such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule and regulation or order of any
Governmental  Authority and (ii) the Issuing Bank or such assignee,  as the case
may be, shall pay to such Lender in immediately  available  funds on the date of
such assignment the principal of and interest  accrued to the date of payment on
the Loans made by such Lender  hereunder and all other amounts  accrued for such
Lender's account or owed to it hereunder.

         (l) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the processing and recordation fee
payable to the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant to paragraph  (b) above shall be
waived in connection with any assignment made to either (i) a person that is not
a bank,  an investment  bank or an Affiliate of a bank or an investment  bank or
(ii) a bank, an investment  bank or an Affiliate of a bank or an investment bank
(a "Financial Institution") which has, to the satisfaction of the Administrative
Agent,  announced and adopted a general policy that (x) is in effect on the date
of the proposed assignment, (y) is binding on such Financial Institution and (z)
provides  that such  Financial  Institution  has  agreed to waive its  rights to
receive all similar  processing,  recordation or assignment  fees which would be
payable as a result of an assignment by any person of any commitments,  loans or
other extensions of credit under a syndicated leveraged credit facility.

         SECTION 9.05. Expenses;  Indemnity.  (a) The Borrowers agree to pay all
out-of- pocket expenses  incurred by the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral
Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank  and the  Swingline  Lender  in  connection  with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein and the preparation and
administration  of this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection
with any  amendments,  modifications  or  waivers  of the  provisions  hereof or
thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby or thereby contemplated shall be
consummated) or incurred by the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral Agent or
any Lender in  connection  with the  enforcement  or protection of its rights in
connection  with this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents or in connection
with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued  hereunder,  including the fees,
charges  and  disbursements  of  Cravath,   Swaine  &  Moore,  counsel  for  the
Administrative   Agent,   and,  in  connection  with  any  such  enforcement  or
protection,  the fees,  charges and  disbursements  of any other counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.

         (b) The Borrowers  agree to indemnify  the  Administrative  Agent,  the
Collateral Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, each Affiliate of any of the
foregoing persons and each of their respective  directors,  officers,  trustees,
employees  and agents (each such person being called an  "Indemnitee")  against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and
disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
any way connected  with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their respective  obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the  Transactions  and the other  transactions
contemplated  thereby,  (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or issuance of
Letters of Credit,  (iii) any claim,  litigation,  investigation  or  proceeding
relating  to any of the  foregoing,  whether  or not any  Indemnitee  is a party
thereto,  or (iv) any  actual  or  alleged  presence  or  Release  of  Hazardous
Materials  on any  property  owned or  operated  by the  Borrower  or any of the
Subsidiaries,  or any Environmental  Claim related in any way to the Borrower or
the Subsidiaries;  provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee,
be available to the extent that such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or
related  expenses are determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction  by final
and nonappealable  judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of such Indemnitee.

         (c) The  provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain  operative and in
full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the  expiration  of the  term  of  this
Agreement,  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration
of any Letter of  Credit,  the  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any term or
provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or any  investigation
made by or on behalf of the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent,  any
Lender or the Issuing  Bank.  All amounts due under this  Section  9.05 shall be
payable on written demand therefor.

         SECTION  9.06.  Right of  Setoff.  If an Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred and be  continuing,  each Lender is hereby  authorized  at any time and
from time to time,  except to the extent prohibited by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final)
at any time held and other  indebtedness  at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the  credit  or the  account  of the  Borrowers  against  any of and all the
obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter  existing under this Agreement and
other Loan  Documents held by such Lender,  irrespective  of whether or not such
Lender  shall  have made any  demand  under  this  Agreement  or such other Loan
Document and although  such  obligations  may be  unmatured.  The rights of each
Lender under this Section 9.06 are in


<PAGE>


                                       88


addition to other rights and remedies  (including  other rights of setoff) which
such Lender may have.

         SECTION  9.07.  Applicable  Law.  THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE  OTHER  LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.  EACH  LETTER OF CREDIT  SHALL BE  GOVERNED  BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OR RULES  DESIGNATED IN SUCH LETTER OF
CREDIT,  OR IF NO SUCH LAWS OR RULES ARE  DESIGNATED,  THE  UNIFORM  CUSTOMS AND
PRACTICE FOR DOCUMENTARY  CREDITS MOST RECENTLY  PUBLISHED AND IN EFFECT, ON THE
DATE SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT WAS ISSUED, BY THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,
PUBLICATION  NO. 500 (THE "UNIFORM  CUSTOMS") AND, AS TO MATTERS NOT GOVERNED BY
THE UNIFORM CUSTOMS, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         SECTION  9.08.  Waivers;  Amendment.  (a) No  failure  or  delay of the
Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank in
exercising  any power or right  hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
such right or power,  or any abandonment or  discontinuance  of steps to enforce
such a right or power,  preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the
exercise  of  any  other  right  or  power.  The  rights  and  remedies  of  the
Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent,  the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents  are  cumulative  and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any  provision of this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party  therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific  instance and for
the purpose for which  given.  No notice or demand on the  Borrowers in any case
shall entitle the Borrowers to any other or further  notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances.

         (b) Neither  this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof may be waived,
amended or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements  in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders; provided,  however, that
no such  agreement  shall (i)  decrease the  principal  amount of, or extend the
maturity of or any scheduled  principal  payment date or date for the payment of
any interest on any Loan or any date for  reimbursement of an L/C  Disbursement,
or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of
interest on any Loan or L/C  Disbursement,  without the prior written consent of
each Lender  affected  thereby,  (ii) decrease other than on a pro rata basis or
increase or extend the  Commitment or decrease or extend the date for payment of
the  Commitment  Fees of any Lender  without the prior  written  consent of such
Lender,  (iii) amend or modify the pro rata  requirements  of Section 2.17,  the
provisions of Section 9.04(j), the provisions of this Section, the definition of
the term "Required  Lenders" or release any Guarantor  (other than pursuant to a
permitted  sale  or  liquidation  of a  Subsidiary  Guarantor)  or  all  or  any
substantial  part of the  Collateral,  without the prior written consent of each
Lender, (iv) amend or modify the protections  afforded to an SPC pursuant to the
provisions  of Section  9.04(i)  without the written  consent of such SPC or (v)
increase the advance rates set forth in the  definition  of the term  "Borrowing
Base" in Section  1.01 or change the  definition  of the term  "Eligible  Billed
Borrowing Base  Receivables",  "Eligible Unbilled Borrowing Base Receivables" or
"Eligible  Margin  Stock  Amount"  without  the  prior  written  consent  of the
Supermajority Lenders; provided further that no such agreement shall


<PAGE>


                                       89


amend,  modify or  otherwise  affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative
Agent, the Collateral  Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder
or under any other  Loan  Document  without  the prior  written  consent  of the
Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender,  respectively.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if the Borrower  shall
request  the  release  of any  Collateral  to be sold as part of any Asset  Sale
permitted  under  Section  6.05 and  shall  deliver  to the  Collateral  Agent a
certificate  to the  effect  that such  Asset  Sale and the  disposition  of the
proceeds  thereof will comply with the terms of this  Agreement,  the Collateral
Agent,  if satisfied  that the applicable  certificate is correct,  shall and is
hereby authorized to, without the consent of any Lender, execute and deliver all
such instruments as may be required to effect the release of such Collateral.

         SECTION 9.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the  contrary,  if at any time the interest  rate  applicable  to any Loan or
participation in any L/C Disbursement, together with all fees, charges and other
amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan or  participation in such L/C
Disbursement under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted  for,  charged,
taken,  received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan or participation in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest  payable in respect of such
Loan or  participation  hereunder,  together with all Charges payable in respect
thereof,  shall be limited to the Maximum  Rate and, to the extent  lawful,  the
interest  and  Charges  that would have been  payable in respect of such Loan or
participation  but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section
9.09 shall be cumulated  and the interest and Charges  payable to such Lender in
respect of other Loans or  participations or periods shall be increased (but not
above the Maximum Rate  therefor)  until such  cumulated  amount,  together with
interest  thereon at the Federal Funds  Effective Rate to the date of repayment,
shall have been received by such Lender.

         SECTION 9.10. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement,  the Fee Letters,  the
Collateral  Agent's  Fee  Letter,  the other Loan  Documents  and,  prior to the
Tranche B Funding Date, the Commitment  Letter,  constitute the entire  contract
between the parties  relative to the subject matter  hereof.  Any other previous
agreement  among the  parties  with  respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof is
superseded  by this  Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents.  Nothing in this
Agreement or in the other Loan Documents,  expressed or implied,  is intended to
confer  upon any  person  (other  than the  parties  hereto and  thereto,  their
respective  successors and assigns permitted hereunder  (including any Affiliate
of the  Issuing  Bank that  issues  any  Letter of  Credit)  and,  to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative
Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent,  the Issuing  Bank and the  Lenders) any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the
other Loan  Documents.  Pursuant to the Fee Letter dated  October 15, 2002,  the
Borrower has given Credit Suisse First Boston the right to change certain of the
terms of the  Tranche  B Credit  Facility  in  connection  with the  syndication
thereof.  Prior to the Tranche B Funding Date,  any such changes may be effected
pursuant to an amendment to this  Agreement that is executed by the Borrower and
Lenders holding a majority of the Term Loan Commitments.

         SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY  LITIGATION  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS.
EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO


<PAGE>


                                       90


ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO  HAVE BEEN  INDUCED  TO ENTER  INTO  THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER  LOAN
DOCUMENTS,  AS  APPLICABLE,  BY,  AMONG  OTHER  THINGS,  THE MUTUAL  WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

         SECTION  9.12.  Severability.  In the  event  any  one or  more  of the
provisions  contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document  should be
held invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality
and  enforceability  of the remaining  provisions  contained  herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired  thereby (it being  understood that
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular  jurisdiction shall not
in  and  of  itself  affect  the  validity  of  such   provision  in  any  other
jurisdiction).  The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace
the invalid,  illegal or unenforce  able  provisions  with valid  provisions the
economic  effect of which  comes as close as  possible  to that of the  invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         SECTION  9.13.   Counterparts.   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different  counterparts),  each
of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract,  and shall become effective as provided in Section
9.03.  Delivery of an executed  signature  page to this  Agreement  by facsimile
transmission  shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart
of this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.14.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement  and are not to  affect  the  construction  of,  or to be  taken  into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.15. Jurisdiction;  Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of
the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property,  to the  nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any New  York  State  court or
Federal  court of the  United  States  of  America  sitting  in the  Borough  of
Manhattan in New York City,  and any  appellate  court from any thereof,  in any
action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the other
Loan Documents,  or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding  may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent  permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each
of the  parties  hereto  agrees  that a final  judgment  in any such  action  or
proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the  judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that the  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral
Agent,  the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding  relating to this Agreement or the other Loan  Documents  against the
Borrowers or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (b)  Each  of the  Borrowers  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  which it may now or here  after  have to the  laying  of venue of any
suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
other Loan  Documents in any such New York State or Federal  court.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

                                       91


         (c) Each party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to service of
process in the manner  provided  for  notices in Section  9.01.  Nothing in this
Agreement  will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 9.16. Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders agrees to keep confidential (and
to  use  its  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cause  its  respective  agents  and
representatives to keep confidential) the Information (as defined below) and all
copies  thereof,  extracts  therefrom  and  analyses  or other  materials  based
thereon, except that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender shall be permitted to disclose Information (a) to such of its
respective   officers,    directors,    employees,    agents,   affiliates   and
representatives as need to know such Information, (b) to a potential assignee or
participant of such Lender or any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in
any swap  agreement  relating  to the  Loans  or such  potential  assignee's  or
participant's  or  counterparty's  advisors  who need to know  such  Information
(provided that any such potential assignee or participant or counterparty shall,
and  shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts  to cause its  advisors  to,  keep
confidential  all such Information on the terms set forth in this Section 9.16),
(c) to the  extent  requested  by any  regulatory  authority,  (d) to the extent
otherwise  required by  applicable  laws and  regulations  or by any subpoena or
similar legal  process,  (e) in connection  with any suit,  action or proceeding
relating  to the  enforcement  of its rights  hereunder  or under the other Loan
Documents or (f) to the extent such Information (i) becomes  publicly  available
other  than as a  result  of a  breach  of  this  Section  9.16 or (ii)  becomes
available  to the  Administrative  Agent,  the Issuing  Bank,  any Lender or the
Collateral  Agent  on a  nonconfidential  basis  from a  source  other  than the
Borrowers.  For the  purposes  of this  Section,  "Information"  shall  mean all
financial  statements,   certificates,   reports,   agreements  and  information
(including all analyses, compilations and studies prepared by the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral  Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender based on any of the
foregoing)  that are received from the  Borrowers and related to the  Borrowers,
any  shareholder  of the Borrowers or any employee,  customer or supplier of the
Borrowers,  other  than  any  of  the  foregoing  that  were  available  to  the
Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
nonconfidential  basis prior to its  disclosure  thereto by the  Borrowers,  and
which are in the case of  Information  provided  after the date hereof,  clearly
identified  at the time of delivery as  confidential  or of such a nature that a
prudent person would expect such Information to be confidential.  The provisions
of this  Section  9.16  shall  remain  operative  and in full  force and  effect
regardless of the expiration and term of this Agreement.
