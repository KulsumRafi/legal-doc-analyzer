        During  the  period,  if any,  from  the date of this  Agreement  to the
Closing  Time,  AACI  will  cause  the  Purchased  Companies  to  conduct  their
respective  businesses in the ordinary and normal course,  consistent  with past
practice.

9.2 ACCESS TO RECORDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY

     (a) During  the  period,  if any,  from the date of this  Agreement  to the
Closing Time,  AACI will provide and will cause each of the Purchased  Companies
to   provide,   access  to  and  shall   permit  the   Purchaser,   through  its
representatives,  to  make  such  investigation  of  the  business,  operations,
properties,  assets  and  records  of  the  Purchased  Companies  and  of  their
respective  financial and legal  conditions as the Purchaser  deems necessary or
advisable,   acting  reasonably,  to  familiarize  itself  with  such  business,
operations,  properties, assets, records and other matters. Without limiting the
generality of the  foregoing,  during the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Closing Time,  AACI shall permit the  Purchaser and its  representatives,
without  interference  to the ordinary  conduct of the  Purchased  Companies and
whenever possible outside of normal business hours, to have reasonable access to

to the extent that any of the  Employees  are  entitled to a Bonus or would have
otherwise  received a Bonus in accordance  with the terms of either of the Bonus
Plans in respect of the fiscal  year  commencing  April 1, 2002 but for the fact
that such  Employees  are no longer  eligible to receive a Bonus under either of
the  Bonus  Plans as a  result  of the sale of the  Purchased  Companies  to the
Purchaser,  AACI  shall  provide  the  Purchaser  with a list of  such  eligible

        Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall undertake

continuance,  and to thereafter  conduct its business and operations under a new
name that does not include the words "Salter Street."

9.6 NON-COMPETITION

     (a) Until the later of (i) the third  anniversary  of the Closing  Date, or
(ii) the  termination of the Services  Agreement,  AACI shall not, and shall not
permit any of its current and  subsequently  acquired  affiliated  companies to,
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever,  including without limitation,
either  individually  or in partnership  or jointly or in  conjunction  with any
other  Person,  as  principal,  agent,   representative,   consultant,   lender,
contractor,  employer,  employee,  investor or shareholder (except to the extent
that AACI  holds 5% or less of the equity of a public  company),  to engage in a
Competitive Business (as defined below).

        As used herein, a "Competitive Business" means a business which provides
standard  definition and high definition  on-line video editing,  DVD authoring,
sound and  picture  editing,  sound  mixing  and design  video  post-production,
descriptive video, video and audio  compression,  quality control,  duplication,
transcripts,  computer  generated  imaging  and other  post-production  services
currently conducted by any of the Purchased  Companies;  provided however,  that
the term "Competitive  Business" expressly excludes those activities of Alliance
Atlantis  Broadcasting  Inc.'s  post-production  group which the Parties jointly
acknowledge currently provide certain of the Services in the Territory and shall
continue to do so.

     (b) The Parties  hereto agree that the  provisions  of this Section 9.6 are
binding on AACI and all of its  current  and  subsequently  acquired  affiliated
companies but shall not bind any companies  that become  affiliates of AACI (but
in any event  continues to bind AACI) in connection  with a change of control of
AACI nor do the  provisions  of this Section 9.6 in any way  preclude  AACI from
acquiring or otherwise being involved with an entity,  the principal business of
which is not a Competitive Business.

     (c) The Parties  hereto agree that the  provisions  of this Section 9.6 are
reasonable and intend that such provisions be enforced as written.  However,  if
any such provision,  or part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the
duration  thereof,  the  area  covered  thereby,  or  the  types  of  activities
restricted  thereby,  the  parties  hereto  agree  that  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction  making  such  determination  shall  have the power to  reduce  the
duration of the provision,  the geographic  area of the provision,  the types of
activities  specified and to delete  specific words or phrases,  and that in its
reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.

9.7 POST-CLOSING CO-OPERATION

        Subsequent  to the Closing Date,  AACI agree to provide such  assistance
and  co-operation,  including without  limitation  appropriate data transfer and
other  information  technology  matters (outlined in Part 9.7), as the Purchaser
may reasonably  request to ensure a smooth  transfer of the Purchased  Companies
and the continuing operation of their respective businesses.

9.8 SATISFACTION OF MATERIAL EQUIPMENT CONTRACTS

        Within 45 days after the  Closing  Date,  AACI  shall,  at its  expense,
discharge all Material Equipment Contracts held by the Purchased Companies,  and
shall take all such other  actions as may be necessary  for full title  (without
any  Encumbrances)  to the  equipment,  assets  and  properties  underlying  the
Material Equipment  Contracts to be transferred to, and vested in, the Purchased
Companies.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  within  three  Business  Days
following  the  exercise  of the  Option  (as that term is defined in the Option
Agreement),  the  Purchaser  notifies  AACI in  writing  that  AACI  should  not
discharge one or more of the Material Equipment  Contracts,  then AACI shall not
discharge  that Material  Equipment  Contract;  provided  however,  that in such
event,  AACI shall not be so obligated unless the Purchaser  arranges,  on terms
satisfactory  to AACI, in its sole  discretion,  for any guaranty to be released
and all obligations of AACI or its affiliates to be discharged or assumed by the
Purchaser or the Purchaser's  nominee  without  further  recourse to AACI or its
affiliates in respect of any Material  Equipment  Contract that is guaranteed by
or otherwise  imposes  obligations on AACI or its  affiliates.  The Stated Price
shall be  reduced  in the  manner  specified  in  Section  3.2 in respect of any
Material  Equipment  Contract(s) that are not discharged in accordance with this
Section 9.8.

     of the Purchased Companies Intercompany Loans;

     (ii) the  Purchased  Companies  shall  transfer to AACI,  or as directed by
     AACI,  all  Government  Tax  Credit   Receivables  in  consideration  of  a
     reduction,  on a  dollar  for  dollar  basis,  of the  Purchased  Companies
     Intercompany  Loans;  provided  however that if such  Government Tax Credit
     Receivables  are  paid  directly  to  the  Purchased  Companies  or to  the
     Purchaser,  the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Purchased Companies to,
     promptly remit the amount of such Government Tax Credit Receivables to AACI
     or as directed by AACI;

     (iii) any cash balances held by the Purchased Companies on the Closing Date
     shall  be used  by  AACI to  reduce  any  outstanding  Purchased  Companies
     Intercompany Loans; and

     (iv) to the extent that any Purchased  Companies  Intercompany Loans remain
     outstanding  after the  foregoing  adjustments,  AACI shall  contribute  or
     otherwise convert the unpaid portion of such Purchased Company Intercompany
     Loans to common  equity of the relevant  Purchased  Company on a dollar for
     dollar  basis,  which  contribution  or  conversion  shall  result  in  the
     cancellation  of the remaining  unpaid  portion of the Purchased  Companies
     Intercompany Loans.

     (c)  Subject  to  Section  9.10,  the  Parties  acknowledge  that it is the
intention of the Parties that none of the Purchased Companies shall, immediately
after the  Closing,  owe any  indebtedness  or liability to AACI with respect to
actions occurring prior to the Closing.

9.10 PURCHASED COMPANY TAX RETURNS

        Any  liability of the  Purchased  Companies  for Taxes  arising from the
contribution  by AACI to the  Purchased  Companies  of the  Purchased  Companies
Intercompany  Loans, as provided in Section 9.9 above,  shall be for the account
of, and payable by, AACI.  If the  Purchaser or any of the  Purchased  Companies
pays any Taxes arising from such  liability,  AACI shall promptly  reimburse the
Purchaser or the Purchased Companies in full for any such payment.

9.11 TAX FILING COVENANT

        AACI will duly and timely file all Tax Returns for each of the Purchased
Companies with the appropriate  Governmental  Authority, at AACI's sole expense,
for the taxation  period  beginning  April 1, 2002 through,  and including,  the
Closing Date, and will duly,  completely and correctly report all income and all
other amounts and information required to be reported thereon.

9.12 FINANCIAL CONDITION ADJUSTMENT

        If  the  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet  indicates  that  the  statements
contained in Section 3.4 of this Agreement  regarding the financial condition of
the Purchased  Companies on the Closing Date are not true and accurate as of the
Closing Date, AACI shall, promptly after such determination, take such action as
it  deems  necessary  (by  way  of  example  only,  by  making  additional  cash
contributions  or assuming  or repaying  certain  liabilities  of the  Purchased
Companies), in its sole discretion, to make such statements true and accurate as
of the Closing Date.

        Effective as and from the Closing  Time,  AACI shall  indemnify and save
the Purchaser and the Purchaser  shall  indemnify and save AACI harmless for and
from (the Party  agreeing to indemnify  being referred to in this Section as the
"Indemnifying  Party" and the Party so  indemnified  being  referred  to in this
Section as the  "Indemnified  Party")  from and against all Claims  which may be
made or brought  against or by an Indemnified  Party,  or which it may suffer or
incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in connection with:

                                       19
<PAGE>

     (a) any  non-fulfilment  of any  covenant or  agreement  on the part of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement;

     (b) any incorrectness in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement; or

     (c) in any  certificate  or other  document  furnished by the  Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement.

10.2 NOTICE OF CLAIM

        The Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice and in any event,
within 20 days of the Indemnified  Party receiving  notice of such Claim, to the
Indemnifying  Party of any claim for  indemnification  pursuant to Section 10.1.
Such notice  shall  specify  whether the Claim  arises as result of a claim by a
Person other than a Party to this  Agreement (a "Third Party  Claim") or whether
the Claim  does not so arise (a "Party  Claim"),  and shall  also  specify  with
reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is available):

     (a) the factual basis for the Claim; and

     (b) the amount of the Claim, or, if an amount is not then determinable,  an
approximate and reasonable estimate of the likely amount of the Claim.

10.3 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION

     (a) Party Claims. With respect to Party Claims, following receipt of notice
from the Indemnified Party of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days
to make such  investigation  of the  Claim as the  Indemnifying  Party  consider
necessary or desirable.  For the purpose of such investigation,  the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon
by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim. If the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such 30 day period
(or any mutually  agreed upon  extension  thereof) to the validity and amount of
such claim,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall  immediately  pay to the Indemnified
Party the full agreed upon amount of the claim.

        If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party do not agree within
such period (or any mutually  agreed upon extension  thereof),  the  Indemnified
Party and the  Indemnifying  Party  agree that the  Indemnified  Party  shall be
entitled  to bring an action in a court of law to recover the full amount of the
Claim and any costs incidental to the action.

     (b) Third Party Claims.

     (i) With respect to any Third Party  Claim,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall
     have the right, at its own expense,  to participate in or assume control of
     the  negotiation,  settlement  or defence of such Third Party Claim and, in
     such event,  the Indemnifying  Party shall reimburse the Indemnified  Party
     for all the Indemnified Party's out-of-pocket  expenses as a result of such
     participation  or assumption.  If the  Indemnifying  Party elects to assume
     such control,  the Indemnified  Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
     Party,  shall have the right to participate in the negotiation,  settlement
     or defence of such Third  Party Claim at its own expense and shall have the
     right to disagree on reasonable grounds with the selection and retention of
     counsel,  in which case counsel  satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party and
     the Indemnified Party shall be retained by the Indemnifying Party.

     (ii) If the  Indemnifying  Party,  having  elected  to  assume  control  as
     contemplated  in  Section  10.3(b)(i)  thereafter  fails to defend any such
     Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified  Party shall be
     entitled to assume such control and the  Indemnifying  Party shall be bound
     by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
     Party Claim.

10.4 ADDITIONAL RULES AND PROCEDURES

        The obligations of the  Indemnifying  Party to indemnify the Indemnified
Party in respect of Claims shall also be subject to the following:

     (a) Any Claim arising as a result of a breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant contained in Article 3 or Article 4 shall be made not later than the
date on which,  pursuant  to  Section  6.1,  such  representation,  warranty  or
covenant is terminated.

     (b) An Indemnifying  Party's  obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
shall only apply if the Claims in respect of which such  Indemnifying  Party has
given an indemnity, in the aggregate,  exceed US$50,000. If the aggregate amount
of Claims exceeds  US$50,000,  then the Indemnifying  Party shall be responsible
for all such Claims.

     (c) If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party
is required by applicable  law to make a payment to any Person (a "Third Party")
with  respect to such Third  Party Claim  before the  completion  of  settlement
negotiations or related legal  proceedings,  the Indemnified Party may make such
payment  and  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall,  forthwith  after  demand  by the
Indemnified Party,  reimburse the Indemnified Party for any such payment. If the
amount of any liability of the Indemnified  Party under the Third Party Claim in
respect of which such a payment was made,  as finally  determined,  is less than
the amount which was paid by the  Indemnifying  Party to the Indemnified  Party,
the Indemnified Party shall,  forthwith after receipt of the difference from the
Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party.

     (d)  Except  in the  circumstance  contemplated  by  Sections  10.4(c)  and
10.3(b)(ii)  and whether or not the  Indemnifying  Party  assume  control of the
negotiation,  settlement  or defence of any Third Party Claim,  the  Indemnified
Party  shall not  negotiate,  settle,  compromise  or pay any Third  Party Claim
except with the prior written consent of the  Indemnifying  Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

     (e) The  Indemnified  Party shall not permit any right of appeal in respect
of any Third Party Claim to  terminate  without  giving the  Indemnifying  Party
notice thereof and an opportunity to contest such Third Party Claim.

     (f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party shall cooperate fully
with each other with  respect to Third Party  Claims,  and shall keep each other
fully advised with respect thereto  (including  supplying copies of all relevant
documentation promptly as it becomes available).

     (g) Notwithstanding  Section 10.3(b)(ii),  the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle any Third  Party Claim or conduct  any  related  legal or  administrative
proceeding  in a manner which would,  in the opinion of the  Indemnified  Party,
acting reasonably, have a material adverse impact on the Indemnified Party.

     (h) The maximum  amount that may be claimed in the  aggregate  by any Party
pursuant to this Article 10 is the Purchase Price.

10.5 INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS

        The parties  agree that this Article 10 sets out the sole and  exclusive
manner by which the Indemnified  Party may seek monetary  compensation  from the
Indemnifying  Party for any matter in respect of which the Indemnified Party may
make a Claim under Section 10.1,  including,  for greater certainty,  any matter
that could be made a Claim under that Section but for Section 10.4(b).

10.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

        Each Party's  liability to the other,  except for liability arising from
such Party's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, is expressly limited
to the Purchase Price.

such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, except where required to do so by
(i) law or by the applicable  regulations or policies of any provincial,  state,
federal,  or other regulatory agency of competent  jurisdiction of either Canada
or the United States or (ii) the Nasdaq Stock  Market,  in  circumstances  where
prior consultation with the other Party is not practicable.

11.2 EXPENSES
