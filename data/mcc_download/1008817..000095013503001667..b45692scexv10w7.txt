II.      PHILOSOPHY & PURPOSE

         The purpose of this Plan is to reward qualified, eligible Participants
who achieve certain Company, group and individual goals during a period when the
Company and/or its Business Units ("BU's") have also achieved certain financial
performance goals. This Plan is designed to encourage specific types of
performance to achieve such objectives as driving a company-wide focus on
revenue growth, profitability and client satisfaction, attracting and retaining
high-quality team members, aligning leaders of BU's and Global Shared Services
Teams ("GSS Teams") around the same business objectives and rewarding teamwork
and joint accountability. This Plan is also designed to empower and reward
performance at the BU or GSS Team level, but places additional emphasis on
overall Company success.

         Receipt of a bonus under this Plan is not guaranteed, but rather
depends on Company, group and individual performance compared against specific
objectives. The Company is optimistic that, during periods when the Company and
BU's achieve their financial performance goals, Participants will have the
opportunity to earn a bonus. However, if achievement of Company or BU financial
performance goals or individual, group or Company performance falls short of
expectations, Participants may qualify for a limited bonus, or possibly no
bonus, as described below and as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion.

                                                                          Page 2

III.     EFFECTIVE DATE

         This Plan is effective January 1, 2003, and covers the period from
January 1 through December 31, 2003 (the "Plan Period"), unless modified or
terminated earlier as provided for in this Plan. All prior bonus plans have
expired of their own terms or have been revoked and withdrawn. This Plan
supersedes all prior written or oral bonus plans, promises, agreements,
practices, understandings, negotiations and/or incentive arrangements.

V.       PLAN COMPONENTS

         The components of this Plan include: (A) funding of a pool available
for bonuses based on Company and BU financial performance and allocation of any
bonus pool to a BU or GSS Team based on performance by that BU or GSS Team
against specific metrics, and (B) distribution to individuals of any bonus pool
made available to a BU or GSS Team based on team and personal performance
against metrics determined by the Company and BU or GSS Team.

A.       FUNDING AND ALLOCATION OF BONUS POOL

         1.       FUNDING MECHANISM OVERALL. Funding, allocation to BU's and GSS
         Teams and receipt of bonuses under this Plan are all contingent on the
         Company's achieving a satisfactory level of financial performance in
         the Plan Period, as described below and as determined in the sole
         discretion of the Company. Both Company and BU-level financial
         performance determine whether a pool is funded and the pool's size. The
         greatest level of funding is achieved when both Company and BU targets
         are met or exceeded, with greater weight on Company operating margin.
         At a high level, the funding mechanism is as follows:

                  a.       [**]% COMPANY FUNDING COMPONENT. [**]% of the
                  potential bonus pool (the "[**]% Company Funding Component")
                  is based on Company operating margin, subject to the terms and
                  conditions of this Plan and as described in more detail in
                  this Plan; and

                  b.       [**]% BU/INDIA/GSS FUNDING COMPONENT. [**]% of the
                  potential bonus pool (the "[**]% BU/India/GSS Funding
                  Component") is based on annual achievement for the Plan Period
                  in the categories described below, subject to the terms and
                  conditions of this Plan and as described in more detail in
                  this Plan:

                           (1)      BU-level contribution margin percent targets
                                    for the U.S. BU's and Canada BU;

                           (2)      Budget target and overall Client
                                    Satisfaction target (as described below) for
                                    the India BU; or

                           (3)      Client Satisfaction targets and Measures of
                                    Excellence (as defined below) for the GSS
                                    Teams.

                  c.       NO FUNDING SCENARIO. Notwithstanding anything to the
                  contrary, although the Company is optimistic that it will
                  achieve profitability in 2003, the Company will not fund any
                  bonus pool under this Plan if the Company has an annual loss
                  of $[**] or more (including any 2003 restructuring costs). The
                  Company will first consider whether its financial performance
                  justifies the funding of a pool available for payment of any
                  bonuses under this Plan. The determination of Company
                  profitability or loss (if any) shall be made by the Company in
                  its sole discretion. If the Company does not achieve its
                  profitability target or a loss within the range stated in this
                  section V(A)(1)(c), the Company may, at any time and in its
                  sole discretion, decide not to fund the pool and that no
                  bonuses will be payable under this Plan, regardless of the
                  performance of any person or individual BU or GSS Team.

         2.       [**]% COMPANY FUNDING COMPONENT

                  Provided that overall Company financial performance allows a
         bonus pool to be funded under this Plan, the [**]% Company Funding
         Component accounts for [**]% of the potential bonus pool that may be
         made available under this Plan, and funding and allocation will occur
         as follows:

                  a.       FUNDING. The Company may partially fund the [**]%
                  Company Funding Component if the Company reaches the [**]
                  level of profitability for 2003. Full funding for the [**]%
                  Company Funding Component will occur if the Company achieves
                  its annual operating margin target of $[**] for 2003, with
                  graduated levels of partial funding at intervals between [**]
                  and the Company's $[**] annual operating margin target. In any
                  event, the level of full or partial bonus pool funding will be
                  determined by the Company in its sole discretion. If the
                  Company exceeds its $[**] annual operating margin target, then
                  bonus pool funding may be increased accordingly; provided,
                  however, that funding will not

                                                                          Page 4

<PAGE>

                  exceed [**]% of the size of the pool at the level
                  corresponding to the annual operating margin target.

                  b.       ALLOCATION. If funded, the bonus pool available for
                  the [**]% Company Funding Component of this Plan will be
                  allocated among BU's and GSS Teams as follows:

                           (1)      The [**]% Company Funding Component will be
                           allocated to the U.S. BU's and Canada BU based on (i)
                           each BU's actual contribution margin percent
                           achievement against its contribution margin percent
                           target and (ii) each BU's proportionate contribution,
                           relative to the other BU's, to the Company's annual
                           operating margin achievement for 2003. The Company,
                           acting in its sole discretion, will set BU
                           contribution margin percent targets for each U.S. BU
                           and the Canada BU for the Plan Period. After the
                           close of the Plan Period, the Company will determine
                           each BU's contribution margin percent achievement for
                           the Plan Period and the proportionate contributions
                           made by each BU to the Company's overall operating
                           margin achievement, with all determinations made by
                           the Company based on Company and BU financial results
                           and applying the Company's sole discretion in
                           measuring, analyzing and interpreting such results.
                           In addition, each BU must meet a minimum threshold
                           contribution margin percentage to receive any portion
                           of the [**]% Company Funding Component. If a U.S. BU
                           does not achieve at least a [**]% contribution margin
                           percent, it will not receive any portion of the [**]%
                           Company Funding Component. If the Canada BU does not
                           achieve at least a [**]% contribution margin percent,
                           it will not receive any portion of the [**]% Company
                           Funding Component.

                           (2)      The [**]% Company Funding Component will be
                           allocated to the India BU and GSS Teams based on the
                           Company's percentage achievement against its annual
                           operating margin target for 2003.

         3.       [**]% BU/INDIA/GSS FUNDING COMPONENT

                  Provided that overall Company performance allows a bonus pool
         to be funded under this Plan, the [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component
         accounts for [**]% of the potential bonus pool that may be made
         available under this Plan. Funding and allocation of this component
         will be as follows:

                  a.       FUNDING AND ALLOCATION - U.S. AND CANADA BU'S. Each
                  of the U.S. BU's and the Canada BU must achieve a minimum
                  contribution margin percent target for the [**]% BU/India/GSS
                  Funding Component to be funded and any allocation made to that
                  BU. Funding and allocation of this component for the U.S. BU's
                  and Canada BU will then be at graduated levels between minimum
                  and target BU contribution margin percent for 2003, as
                  provided in the chart below. Each BU must meet a minimum
                  threshold contribution margin percentage to receive any
                  portion of the [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component. A U.S. BU
                  must achieve at least a [**]% contribution margin percent
                  (except for Financial Services, which must achieve [**]%) to
                  receive any portion of the [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding
                  Component. The Canada BU must achieve at least a [**]%
                  contribution margin percent to receive any portion of the
                  [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component. Also, the chart below
                  includes an accelerator on above-target levels of BU
                  contribution margin percent achievement, with caps of [**]%
                  above specific levels of achievement for various BU's as noted
                  in the chart below.

                                                                          Page 5

</TABLE>

                  The CEO, COO and CFO have the discretion to approve lower
                  contribution margin percent targets for one or more BU's. In
                  such event, the table above will be revised for such BU(s) and
                  this Plan amended accordingly.

                  b.       FUNDING AND ALLOCATION - INDIA BU. To receive any
                  part of the [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component, the India BU
                  must achieve its budget target and overall Client Satisfaction
                  target, all as set, measured and determined by the Company in
                  its sole discretion for the Plan Period. The budget target for
                  the India BU will be set by the Company, reviewed quarterly by
                  the Company CFO and adjusted as deemed appropriate by the
                  Company to respond to variations in required India BU staff
                  size based on the overall Global Distributed Delivery staffing
                  needs of the Company. The [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component
                  will be allocated to the India BU based on the level of its
                  achievement against its budget target and overall Client
                  Satisfaction target, with both metrics having equal weight.

                  c.       FUNDING AND ALLOCATION - GSS TEAMS. GSS Teams must
                  achieve its budget target and minimum targets for Client
                  Satisfaction and Measures of Excellence to receive any part of
                  the [**]% BU/India/GSS Funding Component. The leader of each
                  GSS Team (the "GSS Team Lead"), in conjunction with the CEO,
                  will set targets for annual average Client Satisfaction scores
                  and establish the Measures of Excellence for that GSS Team.
                  Each GSS Team Lead will gather and monitor Client Satisfaction
                  scores throughout the Plan Period and will be responsible for
                  communicating the Measures of Excellence to his or her team
                  and reporting achievement to the Compensation Team of the PSO.

C.       DISTRIBUTION TO INDIVIDUALS

         1.       TARGET BONUS OPPORTUNITY TRACKS. This Plan features three
         "tracks" at the level of individual distributions based on Plan
         metrics. Participants in this Plan who are not Directors or Vice
         Presidents or higher may be on Track A or Track B. Participant in this
         Plan who are Directors, Vice Presidents and higher are on the
         Director/VP Track. Subject to funding of a bonus pool and allocation to
         the applicable BU or GSS Team, the range of individual bonus payouts is
         based on Track assignment and dependent upon Team Performance and
         Personal Performance, each as described below. Subject to funding and
         allocation, target bonus opportunities for each of the tracks are as
         follows:

                  -     Track A Participants have a target bonus opportunity of
                        [**]% of base salary, with maximum bonus potential of
                        [**]% of base salary

                  -     Track B Participants have a target bonus opportunity of
                        [**]% of base salary with maximum bonus potential of
                        [**]% of base salary

                                                                          Page 6

<PAGE>

                  -     Director/VP Track Participants have individual set
                        dollar amounts for their target bonus opportunity, with
                        a maximum bonus potential of [**]% of their target bonus
                        opportunity

         When a Participant's entry into this Plan becomes effective, he or she
         will be informed of his or her applicable Track. Changes between tracks
         are not permitted during the Plan Period except in the event of a
         promotion or title change, in which event the Compensation Team of the
         PSO, the leader of the Participant's BU (the "BU Lead") or GSS Team
         Lead will determine which track is appropriate for the Participant.

         2.       METRICS. Provided that a bonus pool is funded and a BU or GSS
         Team receives an allocation, and subject to the size of that
         allocation, distributions to Participants within those BU's or GSS
         Teams will be made based on the Participant's Track assignment and a
         combination of Team Performance (as described below) and Personal
         Performance (as described below), with the greater weight on Team
         Performance.

                  a.       TEAM PERFORMANCE. The Team Performance metric
                  accounts for [**]% of an individual distribution and consists
                  of Client Satisfaction and Days Over Plan (each as described
                  below) for project delivery Participants assigned to the U.S.,
                  Canada or India BU's. In determining the Team Performance
                  metric for project delivery Participants in the BU's, both the
                  Client Satisfaction and Days Over Plan metrics will be
                  weighted equally.

                  For Participants assigned to GSS Teams and Participants who
                  perform internal functions within a BU, the Team Performance
                  metric consists of Client Satisfaction and Measures of
                  Excellence (as described below). In determining the Team
                  Performance metric for GSS Teams, both the Client Satisfaction
                  and Measures of Excellence metrics will be weighted equally.

                           (1) CLIENT SATISFACTION. The Client Satisfaction
                           metric uses a score representing the annual
                           time-weighted average of Client Satisfaction scores
                           for client delivery projects within a BU and internal
                           delivery projects for the Company or the annual
                           weighted average for projects within a GSS Team or
                           performed by Participants in internal functions
                           within a BU. The target for annual weighted average
                           Client Satisfaction scores is between [**] and [**]
                           on a 5-point scale, with allocation based on the
                           average of scores earned in the Plan Period.

                                    For project delivery Participants within the
                           BU's, the Client Satisfaction metric is based on the
                           time-weighted average of all approved and unadjusted
                           client satisfaction scores (in Pyramid) pertaining to
                           completed client projects and internal delivery
                           projects for the Company to which a Participant was
                           assigned during the Plan Period, as determined by the
                           Company. Project leadership in the BU's is required
                           to enter Client Satisfaction scores into the
                           Company's Pyramid system within [**] days after the
                           completion of the project ([**] days for
                           Implementation projects). If the unadjusted Client
                           Satisfaction score for a project is not entered into
                           Pyramid within the applicable time limit set forth
                           above, the project will be recognized with a score of
                           [**] in this Plan Period. No estimated scores will be
                           included in the time-weighted average. The BU Lead
                           must submit the Client Satisfaction scores for all
                           projects completed during the Plan Period by their
                           teams to the Compensation Team of the PSO by January
                           15, 2004.

                                                                          Page 7

                                    For GSS Team Participants and Participants
                           who perform internal functions within a BU, the
                           Client Satisfaction metric is based on the weighted
                           average of Client Satisfaction scores for completed
                           projects on which a Participant worked and for which
                           scores were collected during the Plan Period. Each
                           GSS Team Lead (and BU Lead for Participants who
                           perform internal functions within a BU) must submit
                           the Client Satisfaction scores for all projects
                           completed with collected scores during the Plan
                           Period to the Compensation Team of the PSO by January
                           15, 2004.

                                    The annual time-weighted average or weighted
                           average, as applicable and as determined by the
                           Company in each case, for each Participant's projects
                           is then used as the Score in the chart above to
                           determine the payout percentage for the Client
                           Satisfaction metric. The maximum payout level for the
                           Client Satisfaction metric is [**]%.

                           (2) DAYS OVER PLAN. For project delivery Participants
                           within the BU's only, the Days Over Plan metric uses
                           a score representing the time-weighted average of the
                           percentages of the number of days in excess of
                           project plan for the projects completed by that BU
                           and to which a Participant was assigned during the
                           Plan Period, as determined by Sapient. The target for
                           Days Over Plan under this Plan is [**]% inclusive,
                           with allocation based on the average of actual scores
                           for projects completed during the Plan Period.

                                    The time-weighted average of the Days Over
                           Plan Percentages is then used as the Score in the
                           chart above to determine the payout percentage for
                           the Days Over Plan metric, except for projects that
                           are classified by the Company as "time and materials"
                           projects. A payout percentage of [**]% will be used
                           for projects classified by the Company as "time and
                           materials" projects, except that the BU Lead in
                           conjunction with the COO will determine a payout
                           percentage of less than [**]% for a "time and
                           materials" project if time and/or expenses are
                           incurred on the project but not billed to a client.
                           The maximum payout level for the Days Over Plan
                           metric is [**]%. The BU Lead must submit the Days
                           Over Plan scores for their teams for the Plan Period
                           to the Compensation Team of the PSO by January 15,

                           (3) MEASURES OF EXCELLENCE. For GSS Teams and
                           Participants who perform internal functions within a
                           BU, the percentage for the Measures of Excellence
                           metric will be calculated based on the scores for
                           achievement of the applicable Measures of Excellence.

                           Excellence metric is [**]%. Each GSS Team Lead and BU
                           Lead must submit the Measures of Excellence scores
                           for the Plan Period to the Compensation Team of the
                           PSO by January 15, 2004.

                  b.       PERSONAL PERFORMANCE. Provided that a bonus pool is
                  funded and a BU or GSS Team receives an allocation, then
                  individual assessments are used to measure performance of a
                  Participant against Personal Performance goals established by
                  his or her BU Lead or GSS Team Lead. Subject to the size of
                  the available pool for a BU or GSS Team, the measurement of a
                  Participant's performance (expressed as a percentage) is then
                  applied against the Participant's target bonus opportunity for
                  Personal Performance to determine the payout on Personal
                  Performance. If the bonus pool is not fully funded, payouts
                  will be proportionately lower, even if Personal Performance is
                  at or above [**]%. Each Participant's Personal Performance
                  goals are established by the BU or GSS Team Lead at the
                  beginning of the Plan Period and are subject to change in the
                  BU Lead's or GSS Team Lead's sole discretion. A BU Lead or GSS
                  Team Lead may select objective and/or subjective goals for
                  each Participant within the BU or GSS Team and set the
                  relative weights for each goal. A BU or GSS Team Lead may
                  select any combination of Personal Performance goals for each
                  Participant within the BU or GSS Team and set the relative
                  weights for them. Each GSS Team Lead and BU Lead must submit
                  the Personal Performance scores for the Plan Period to the
                  Compensation Team of the PSO by January 15, 2004.

A NOTE ON ROUNDING: For purposes of calculations of the BU and GSS Team
allocations and individual metrics, the Client Satisfaction scores, Days Over
Plan and achievement against Personal Performance goals and Measures of
Excellence will be rounded to one decimal place, with anything equal to or above
a value of 5 in the second decimal place being rounded up.

VI.      TIMING OF PAYOUTS; PRORATIONS; CURRENCY

         A.       TIMING

         Each BU Lead and GSS Team Lead must promptly report achievement against
the Team and Personal Performance metrics to the Compensation Team after the
close of each Plan Period. The CFO must promptly report the results of the
funding and allocation mechanisms to the Compensation Team after the close of
the Plan Period. Following that reporting by each BU Lead and the CFO, a number
of calculations need to be made to determine individuals' bonus or incentive
results. Accordingly, any annual payouts will be made in the Sapient pay period
following completion of the calculations.

         B.       PRORATIONS

         If a prorated bonus or incentive is payable, the following rule
applies: Proration will be calculated on the basis of [**] for each half
calendar month of eligibility, as outlined in the table below. A half calendar
month is defined as either the period between the 1st and 15th of a calendar
month or the period between the 16th and the last day of the calendar month.

                                                                          Page 9

</TABLE>

         To the extent any bonuses or incentives are paid under this Plan, if a
date is not otherwise specified in this Plan for a proration, then for a month
to be included in a proration calculation, the event giving rise to the
proration must occur on or before the 15th of a month. If such event occurs
after the 15th of a month, the next calendar month will be considered the first
month of the occurrence for purposes of proration. In the event of any proration
of year-to-date amounts, any previous payouts will be deducted.

         The circumstances that may warrant pro rata payment include but are not
limited to:

         -        Base compensation changes;

         -        Target bonus opportunity changes;

         -        Bonus Track changes;

         -        Commencement of employment and new entrance into this Plan;

         -        Certain title changes (as described below);

         -        Certain movement among BU's (as described below);

         -        Involuntary termination without "Cause" (as defined below);
                  and

         -        Qualified leave of absence, disability or death of Participant
                  (as discussed below).

         C.       CURRENCY

         All currency figures in this Plan are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless
stated otherwise in this Plan, but payout calculations and payments are done in
local currency. In performing currency conversions, if any, Sapient will apply
commercial exchange rates determined by Sapient in its sole discretion.

VII.     TITLE CHANGES

         A person ceases to participate in this Plan if he or she changes to a
Sapient title or job that is not eligible under this Plan. If a person remains
employed by the Company but moves to a title that is not eligible under this
Plan, then the time the person is considered eligible under this Plan will be
pro-rated subject to the proration rules of this Plan. If a Participant remains
on this Plan for the entire Plan Period but during that time switches to a
different title also covered by this Plan, then the time spent in each title
will be prorated, as applicable, subject to the proration rules of this Plan.

         If a Participant's regular BU assignment changes within the Plan Period
(as approved by appropriate BU management and recorded in the Company's HRIS
system), at the end of the Plan Period, then the time spent in each BU will be
prorated subject to the proration rules of this Plan.

                                                                         Page 10

<PAGE>

IX.      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

         A.       VOLUNTARY

         Participants must be employed by the Company in an eligible title
through the entire Plan Period and until the day payouts are made for the Plan
Period to receive a payout under this Plan (except in the circumstances
described in the Plan when a prorated payment is permitted). Therefore,
employees who voluntarily terminate their employment for any reason before the
end of the Plan Period or the day payouts are made for the Plan Period are not
eligible for any payout under this Plan.

         B.       INVOLUNTARY AND WITHOUT "CAUSE"

                  1.       SAPIENT CORPORATION PARTICIPANTS. If the Company
                  terminates a Sapient Corporation Participant's employment
                  without "Cause" (as that term is defined below) prior to the
                  end of the Plan Period, that Participant will be eligible for
                  pro rata payout in accordance with the above schedule through
                  his or her termination date, if the Company funds a pool and
                  the Participant's BU receives an allocation for the Plan
                  Period.

                  2.       SAPIENT CANADA PARTICIPANTS AND SAPIENT INDIA
                  PARTICIPANTS. If the Company terminates a Sapient Canada
                  Participant's or Sapient India Participant's employment
                  without Cause prior to the end of the Plan Period or the date
                  payouts are made for the Plan Period, that Participant is not
                  eligible for any payout under this Plan. For all purposes, the
                  termination date shall be deemed to be the Participant's last
                  day of active employment.

         C.       INVOLUNTARY AND WITH "CAUSE"

         Participants must be employed by the Company in an eligible title
through the entire Plan Period and until the day payouts are made for the Plan
Period to receive a payout under this Plan (except in the circumstances
described in the Plan when a prorated payment is permitted). Therefore,
employees who are involuntarily terminated with Cause before the end of the Plan
Period or the date payouts are made for the Plan Period are not eligible for any
payout under this Plan.

         D.       ALL EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONS

         1.       DEFINITION OF "CAUSE." For purposes of this Plan, "Cause"
         shall mean, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion: (a) a
         Participant's substantial and continuing failure to perform the duties
         of his or her employment (whether by reason of neglect, inattention,
         inability or otherwise); (b) a Participant's misconduct or negligence
         in connection with the performance of such duties; (c) breach of any of
         a Participant's representations, warranties or obligations under his or
         her Employee NDA; (d) a Participant's failure to comply with Sapient
         policies, including without limitation Sapient's Equal Employment
         Opportunity and Harassment Policy; or (e) a Participant's conviction of
         a crime other than minor traffic violations or other infractions (or in
         the case of a Sapient Canada Participant, a Criminal offence for which
         a pardon has not been granted), either: (i) in connection with the
         performance of his or her obligations to the Company; or (ii) which
         could adversely affect his or her ability to perform such obligations.
         "Conviction" includes pleas of guilty or nolo contendere in the case of
         a Sapient Corporation Participant and a plea of guilty in the case of a
         Sapient Canada Participant.

         2.       NO EXTENSION. A Participant's right to receive payment or
         participate in this Plan shall not be extended beyond his or her last
         day of active employment because he or she receives pay in lieu of
         notice in accordance with his or her Employment Contract.

                                                                         Page 11

<PAGE>

         3.       TIMING OF PRORATED PAYMENTS. Any prorated bonus or incentive
         components calculated and payable under this Plan in the event of a
         termination will be paid at the same time that bonuses or incentives
         are paid to other Participants for the Plan Period in which the
         termination date occurred or, at the Company's discretion, at an
         earlier date.

X.       LEAVES OF ABSENCE AND SHORT TERM DISABILITY

         If a Participant takes an approved leave of absence (including a
medical leave under the Company's Short-Term Disability Program) during the Plan
Period for fewer than 30 days, no adjustment will be made in the payout
calculation or in the Participant's metrics.

         If such leave of absence extends for more than 30 days during the Plan
Period, the Participant may be eligible for a pro rated payout calculated in
accordance with the above table and the other terms of this Plan. All payments
(if any) will be paid on the same date that active Participants receive payment.

         For purposes of determining whether the payment may be pro rated, a
leave of absence begins on the date that the leave of absence begins as noted in
the Company's records (or in the case of short term disability, on the same date
that short term disability benefits begin).

XI.      DEATH AND LONG TERM DISABILITY

         In the event of long-term disability or death, a pro rated payment
based on the length of service during the Plan Period will be paid in accordance
with the above table and other terms of this Plan. All such payments (if any)
will be paid on the same date that active Participants receive payment or, at
the Company's discretion, at an earlier date. "Long-term disability" is defined
as eligibility to receive long-term disability benefits under the Company's LTD
Policy. For proration purposes, active service ends when the employee is no
longer paid regular wages through payroll for work performed.

XII.     LOANS, ADVANCES OR DRAWS

         Loans or advances against potential payments will not be made under
this Plan. If a Participant has an outstanding advance or loan from the Company
or has an outstanding obligation to repay to the Company money related to an
expatriate assignment or tax equalization, all or a portion of any bonus or
incentive payout under this Plan may be first applied to the outstanding balance
of such advance, loan or obligation related to an expatriate assignment or tax
equalization, as permitted by law. Upon request by the Company, any Participant
with such an outstanding loan, advance or other obligation will sign and deliver
a written instrument authorizing such application of any payout.

XIII.    FORMS OF PAYMENT

         As permitted by law, Sapient may, with the agreement of a Participant,
pay a bonus or incentive in whole or in part, in cash, stock options, stock,
warrants or other equity instruments (or any combination thereof), in such
amounts and under such terms and conditions to which Sapient and a Participant
may agree.

                                                                         Page 12

<PAGE>

XIV.     PLAN ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT

         A Plan Committee will administer this Plan. The Plan Committee will be
composed of a Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Operating Officer, General Counsel, Vice President in charge of the PSO,
representative from the Compensation Team of the PSO and selected executive
leaders of BU's. The Plan Committee will have full and absolute discretion with
respect to administration of all aspects of this Plan, including, without
limitation, determining Plan payouts, interpreting this Plan and ruling on
special situations. Further, the Plan Committee, in its sole discretion and with
or without notice or cause, may, to the extent authorized by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation
Committee"), modify, amend or terminate this Plan or take other actions
affecting Plan Participants without advance notice to Participants of such
actions. While this Plan will be administered in accordance with applicable law,
nothing in this Plan is a guarantee of current or future compensation or income.

         The Company's books and records are the exclusive source of data for
administration of this Plan. The Plan Committee's interpretation of the books
and records is final.

         If a Participant wants to dispute a bonus or incentive payout or
calculation decision affecting the Participant or any other decision affecting
the Participant, that Participant must request reconsideration in writing. The
request must be given to the Vice President of the PSO within 60 days after the
date of the disputed decision. By participating in this Plan, each Participant
agrees that a failure to properly request reconsideration of any payout or
calculation decision or other decision within this 60-day period constitutes
agreement with such decision made by the Company. If the reconsideration request
is properly submitted, the Vice President of the PSO will resolve the disputed
decision upon review of the circumstances and of the available documentation and
submit his or her initial determination to the Plan Committee for review. The
decision of the Plan Committee as to such dispute will be final.

XV.      MISCELLANEOUS

         Unless required by law or court order, a Participant may not assign
this Plan or any bonus or incentive payment or right to payment.

         If a provision of this Plan is found invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
the other provisions of this Plan shall remain in full force and effect, and
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be reformed as necessary
to make it valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent possible under law
(or, if such reformation is impossible, such provision shall be severed from
this Plan).

         All payouts under this Plan are subject to applicable withholdings and
deductions as required by law.

         This Plan supersedes all prior understandings, negotiations and
agreements, whether written or oral, between each individual Participant and the
Company as to the subject matter covered by this Plan. This Plan describes the
sole and exclusive bonuses or incentives the Company is offering to Participants
during the Plan Period; provided, however, that nothing in this Plan will
prevent the Company from paying any individual a discretionary bonus or
incentive payment at any time or from time to time if authorized in advance by
the Compensation Committee. The Company has no obligation to pay anyone a
discretionary bonus or incentive at any time.

                                                                         Page 13
