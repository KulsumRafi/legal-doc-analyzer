any recovery by the Company. In the event that the Executive fails to do so, the Executive agrees that the Executive's right to any payment pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;8 shall be forfeited (but only

this paragraph&nbsp;6, the Company shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving actual damages, as well as provable damages and an equitable
accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this paragraph (with appropriate credit for the amounts forfeited by the Executive and the

applicable law, that such amendment shall apply only within the jurisdiction of the court that made such adjudication and that the provision otherwise be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by
law. The Executive irrevocably and unconditionally (x)&nbsp;agrees that any suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of this Paragraph, including without limitation, any action commenced
by the Company for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief, may be brought (without posting a bond) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,
or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in New Jersey, (y)&nbsp;consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding, and (z)&nbsp;waives any objection which the Executive may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court.
