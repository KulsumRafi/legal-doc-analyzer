              whereby the Participant agrees not to disclose or use for the
              Participant's own benefit any information deemed to be

              non-competition agreement and confidentiality agreement each to be
              effective upon a Qualifying Termination of Participant's
              employment with the Company and to be in such form as the Company
              may request. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
              payment of the salary and benefits to any Participant provided for
              in Subsections 4(b)(ii) and (iii) and 4(c)(ii) and (iii) shall not
              commence until execution and delivery of such non-competition
              agreement and confidentiality agreement by such Participant to the
              Company.

              "(c)   Termination of Payments and Benefits. The Company shall
              have no further obligation under the Plan to make payments or
              provide benefits to any Participant who materially breaches any
              release or non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or
              similar agreement between such Participant and the Company or any
              of its Affiliates."
