more Lender with Term Loans B outstanding elects not to receive its pro rata
share of such prepayment, such Lender shall provide written notice of the amount
it elects not to receive in prepayment of its Term Loan B, and such amount shall
be reallocated to payment of the Term Loans A based upon the Ratable Share of
the Lenders with Term Loans A, to be applied by the Lenders with Term Loans A in
the inverse order of scheduled maturities. To the extent that a Mandatory
Prepayment of Excess Cash Flow exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the
Term Loans, such prepayment shall be limited to the amount necessary to prepay
the Term Loans in full.

       PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE TERM LOANS A AND TERM LOANS B BASED UPON THE
       RATABLE SHARE OF SUCH TERM LOANS TO ALL THE TERM LOANS A AND TERM LOANS
       B, IN EACH CASE BY APPLICATION TO THE UNPAID INSTALLMENTS OF PRINCIPAL IN

       MATURITIES.

              (ii)   Within five (5) Business Days of any sale of assets
       authorized by Section 8.2.7(ii), (iv) or (v), exclusive of the sale to
       RAC under the RAC Agreement, and if the net after-tax cash proceeds of
       such sale, when aggregated with all such prior asset sales in the same
       fiscal year of the Borrower, is equal to or greater than $250,000, the
       Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall make a mandatory prepayment of
       principal equal to the net after-tax cash proceeds of such sale to the
       extent the aggregate net after-tax cash proceeds of such sale and all
       prior such assets sales in the fiscal year exceed $250,000 (as estimated
       in good faith by the Borrower and the Co-Borrower). At the time of any
       issuance of equity by the Borrower authorized by Section 8.2.13(iv), then
       simultaneously with the issuance of such capital stock by the Borrower,
       the Borrower shall make a mandatory prepayment of principal equal to the
       net after-tax cash proceeds of such issuance. In the event that the
       Required Lenders permit the incurrence of Indebtedness other than as
       permitted under Section 8.2.1, the Borrower shall make a mandatory
       prepayment of principal equal to the net cash proceeds of such
       Indebtedness. In the event that the Administrative Agent does not
       disburse insurance proceeds in excess of $250,000 to the Loan Parties
       pursuant to Section 8.1.3, such proceeds shall be applied as a mandatory
       prepayment of principal equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds.
       All prepayments pursuant to this Section 5.5.2 (ii) shall be applied in
       accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5.1, and upon payment in full
       of the Term Loans, then as a


                                       9
<PAGE>

       permanent reduction to the Revolving Credit Commitments. In the event
       that any one or more Lenders with Term Loans B outstanding elects not to
       receive its pro rata share of such prepayments, such Lender shall provide
       written notice of the amount it elects not to receive in prepayment of
       its Term Loan B, and such amount shall be reallocated to payment of the
       Term Loans A based upon the Ratable Share of the Lenders with Term Loans
       A, to be applied by the Lenders with Term Loans A in the inverse order of
       scheduled maturities.

              5.5.3  Application Among Interest Rate Options.

                     All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall
first be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the
Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Loans subject to a Euro-Rate
Option. In accordance with Section 5.6.2, the Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall
indemnify the Lenders for any loss or expense, including loss of margin,
incurred with respect to any such prepayments applied against Loans subject to a
Euro-Rate Option on any day other than the last day of the applicable Interest
Period."

       11.    The following new Section 11.20 is hereby inserted in the Credit
Agreement immediately following Section 11.19 of the Credit Agreement:

              "11.20 Amendment of Terms of Supplemental Term Loans.

                     Without the written consent of all the Lenders which have

(i) increase the amount of the Supplemental Term Loan Commitment of such Lender
without such Lender's written consent, (ii) extend the Supplemental Term Loan
Maturity Date, (iii) extend the time for any regularly scheduled payment or
prepayment (including payment upon the Closing Date under the RAC Agreement) of
principal or interest of any Supplemental Term Loan, reduce the principal amount
of or the rate of interest borne by any Supplemental Term Loan, or reduce any
fee payable to the Supplemental Term Loan Lenders, or (iv) except for sales of

its Obligations under the Guaranty Agreement or any other security for the
Supplemental Term Loans."
