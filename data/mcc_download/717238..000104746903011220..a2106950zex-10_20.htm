specified in the first paragraph of this Warrant by the surrender of this Warrant (properly endorsed) to the Company. Upon exercise of the Net Issuance Right with respect to a particular number of
shares subject to this Warrant (the "Net Issuance Warrant Shares"), the Company shall deliver to the Holder (without payment by the Holder of any Exercise Price or any cash or other consideration)
that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (X)&nbsp;the value of this Warrant (or the specified portion hereof) on the Net Issuance Exercise Date, which value
shall be determined by subtracting (A)&nbsp;the aggregate Exercise Price of the Net Issuance Warrant Shares immediately prior to the exercise of the Net Issuance Right from (B)&nbsp;the aggregate

the Holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and number of shares of the Company and rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of the
Company (or, in the event of the redemption of any such rights, any cash paid in respect of such redemption) that he, she or it would have owned or been entitled to receive after the happening of any
of the events described above had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this
paragraph&nbsp;(a) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the next business day following the record date in the case of dividends or other distributions and shall
become effective immediately after the opening of business on the next business day following the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. </FONT></P>

of its Common Stock evidences of indebtedness of the Company or assets of the Company (including cash dividends or distributions out of retained earnings other than cash dividends or distributions
made on a quarterly or other periodic basis) or warrants to subscribe for securities of the Company (excluding those referred to in paragraph&nbsp;(a) above), then in each case the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such distribution by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the then current Market Price
(as defined in paragraph&nbsp;(c) below) per share of Common Stock on the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution, less the then fair value (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights
or warrants which are applicable to one share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall be such Market Price per share of Common Stock; provided, however, that if the then current Market
Price per share of Common Stock on the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution is less than the then fair value of the portion of the assets or evidences of
indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants which are applicable to one share of Common Stock, the foregoing adjustment of the Exercise Price shall not be made and in lieu
thereof the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant in addition to the Common Stock the kind and number of assets, evidences of indebtedness, subscription rights and warrants
(or, in the event of the redemption of any such evidences of indebtedness, subscription rights and warrants, any cash paid in respect of such redemption) that he, she or it would have owned or have
been entitled to receive after the happening of such distribution had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such distribution. Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such
record date had not been fixed. </FONT></P>

Common Stock at any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily Closing Price per share for the 15 consecutive Trading Days (as defined below) commencing 30 Trading Days before the date in
question. "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Closing Price</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" is defined as the closing price for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. If Closing Price cannot be established as
described above, Market Price shall be the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Trading Day</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"

ten-thousandth) obtained by (A)&nbsp;multiplying (x)&nbsp;the number of shares covered by this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price by (y)&nbsp;the
Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price and (ii)&nbsp;dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment
of the Exercise Price. </FONT></P>

Price of such Warrant Shares is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall promptly mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder of this Warrant notice of such adjustment or
adjustments. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. </FONT></P>

a result of an adjustment made pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(a) above, above, the Holder of this Warrant shall become entitled to purchase any securities of the Company other than Common Stock,
thereafter the number of such other securities so purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price of such securities shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and
