         2.3      Release and Disposition of Collateral. Until such time as all
First Tier Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash and satisfied and the
commitments under the Senior Credit Documents shall have expired or been
terminated, (i) the Collateral Agent will act at the sole direction of the
Senior Administrative Agent (or if there is no Senior Administrative Agent, the
Majority Lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement) for the benefit of the
Senior Creditors, and thereafter at the direction of the Junior Administrative
Agent (or if there is no Junior Administrative Agent, the Required Banks (as
such term is defined in the Junior Credit Agreement) under the Junior Credit
Agreement), including releases of Collateral (whether or not such result in a
payment of the First Tier Indebtedness), and (ii) the Junior Administrative
Agent and the Junior Creditors will execute and deliver promptly upon request
any and all releases and other documents and any agreements that the Collateral
Agent or the Senior Administrative Agent deem necessary or appropriate to give
effect to any release or disposition of Collateral free of the liens and
interests of the Junior Creditors; provided, however, that (A) if, at the time
that there is First Tier Indebtedness outstanding, the Pledgor shall receive and
apply all Net Cash Proceeds from the sale or disposition of the Collateral in an
amount sufficient to pay all First Tier Indebtedness in full in cash and
terminate all commitments related thereto, then the application of any and all
amounts in excess of that required to retire such First Tier Indebtedness shall

Collateral Agent shall only release Collateral to the extent the proceeds
therefrom are either applied to permanently reduce First Tier Indebtedness
and/or applied to Second Tier Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the
Junior Credit Documents.

         2.4      Limitations on Rights and Remedies.

                  (a)      Until all First Tier Indebtedness has been paid in

Credit Documents have expired or been terminated, the Junior Administrative
Agent and the Junior Creditors shall not be entitled to (i) exercise any rights
or remedies with respect to the Collateral, including without limitation the
right to (A) enforce any liens or sell or otherwise foreclose on any portion of
the Collateral or (B) request any action, institute proceedings, give any
instructions, make any election, notice account debtors or make collections with
respect to any portion of the Collateral, or (ii) demand, accept or obtain any
lien on any Collateral (except for liens subject to the terms of this
Agreement). It is understood and agreed, however, that this Agreement shall in
no way limit or affect the rights of the Junior Creditors or the Junior
Administrative Agent with respect to an exercise of rights and remedies against
SpaceCom and its Subsidiaries or with respect to collateral pledged by SpaceCom
and its Subsidiaries to secure the loans and obligations owing under the Junior
Credit Agreement.

                  (b)      Until the date 91 days after all First Tier
Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash and satisfied and the obligations and
commitments under the Senior Credit Documents have been terminated, neither the
Junior Administrative Agent nor any Junior Creditor shall take any action,

and enforceable pursuant to its terms in accordance with Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, and all references herein to the Pledgor shall be deemed to
apply to such entity as debtor in possession and to any trustee in bankruptcy
for the estate(s) of such entity.

                  (b)      Except as otherwise specifically permitted in this
Section 2.5, until the First Tier Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash and
satisfied and all obligations and commitments under the Senior Credit Documents
have been terminated, the Junior Administrative Agent and each Junior Creditor
shall not assert, or make any request or demand upon the Collateral Agent to
assert, without the written consent of the Senior Administrative Agent, any
claim, motion, objection, or argument in respect of the Collateral in connection
with any Bankruptcy Event which could otherwise be asserted or raised in
connection with such Bankruptcy Event by the Junior Administrative Agent or any
Junior Creditor as a creditor of the Pledgor or equity holder of Satellite,
including without limitation any claim, motion, objection or argument seeking or
opposing adequate protection or relief from the automatic stay in respect of the
Collateral.

                  (c)      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Junior Administrative Agent and each Junior Creditor agrees that if a Bankruptcy
Event occurs, (i) the Senior Administrative Agent and the Senior Creditors (and
the Collateral Agent on their behalf) may consent to the use of cash collateral
on such terms and conditions and in such amounts as they, in their sole
discretion, may decide without seeking or obtaining the consent of the Junior
Administrative Agent or any Junior Creditor as holder of an interest in the
Collateral; (ii) any of the Senior Creditors may provide postpetition financing
for the Pledgor and its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to Section 364 of
the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law and on such terms and conditions and

without seeking or obtaining the consent of the Junior Administrative Agent or
the Junior Creditors as holder of an interest in the Collateral; (iii) neither
the Junior Administrative Agent nor the Junior Creditors shall oppose the
Pledgor's or its Subsidiaries' use of cash collateral on the basis that their
interest in the Collateral is impaired by such use or inadequately protected by
such use to the extent such use has been approved by the Senior Administrative
Agent or the Senior Creditors in their sole discretion; and (iv) neither the
Junior Administrative Agent nor the Junior Creditors shall oppose any sale or
other disposition of any assets comprising part of the Collateral free and clear
of security interests, liens or other claims of any party, including the Junior
Administrative Agent and the Junior Creditors, under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code on the basis that the interest of either the Junior
Administrative Agent or the Junior Creditor in the Collateral is impaired by
such sale or inadequately protected as a result of such sale if the Senior
Administrative Agent has consented to such sale or disposition of such assets.

                  (d)      The Junior Administrative Agent and each Junior
Creditor agrees that it will not initiate, prosecute, encourage, or assist with
any other person to initiate or prosecute any claim, action or other proceeding

challenging the validity, enforceability or unavoidability of any claim of the
Senior Administrative Agent or the Senior Creditors with respect to the
Collateral or otherwise, (iii) challenging the perfection, enforceability or
unavoidability of any liens securing the First Tier

Indebtedness, or (iv) asserting any claims which the Pledgor or its Subsidiaries
may hold with respect to the Senior Administrative Agent or the Senior Creditors
or the First Tier Indebtedness, if any.

                  (e)      To the extent that the Senior Administrative Agent or
any Senior Creditor receives payments or transfers on the First Tier
Indebtedness or proceeds of the Collateral which are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state
or federal law, common law, or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such
payment or proceeds received, the First Tier Indebtedness, or part thereof,
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect
enjoying all rights and benefits of this Agreement as if such payments or
proceeds had not been received by the Senior Administrative Agent or such Senior
Creditor.

                  (f)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section,
the Junior Administrative Agent and each Junior Creditor shall be entitled to
file any necessary responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any
motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person
objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims of the Junior
Administrative Agent or any Junior Creditor including without limitation any
claims secured by the Collateral, if any.

                  (ii)     any change in the time, manner or place of, or in any

         any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
         guarantee, for all or any of the First Tier Indebtedness; or

                  (iv)     any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party
         in respect of the First Tier Indebtedness, or of the Second Tier

Administrative Agent and the Senior Creditors under this Agreement, the Senior
Credit Agreement and the other Senior Credit Documents or any other loan or
collateral documents relating to the First Tier Indebtedness shall be cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise

shall operate as a waiver of such right, nor shall any partial or single
exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further exercise or the
exercise of any other power or right.

         (b)      Waiver of Marshalling. The Pledgor, the Junior Administrative
Agent and the Junior Creditors each hereby waives any right to require

or the Senior Creditors and any similar rights.

         2.11     Modification and Refinancing of the First Tier Indebtedness.

Senior Creditors to make amendments to or modifications of the First Tier
Indebtedness or the Senior Credit Documents (or to establish new or additional
First Tier Indebtedness and enter into new or additional credit documents in
connection therewith) without notice to or the consent of the Junior Creditors;
provided, however, the First Tier Indebtedness shall not exceed the Maximum
First Tier Indebtedness Amount without the consent of the Required Banks as such
term is defined in the Junior Credit Agreement, or (ii) the right of the Junior

Creditors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with
any refinancing or replacement of all or any portion of the First Tier
Indebtedness (or the establishment of new or additional First Tier
Indebtedness), the Junior Administrative Agent and each Junior Creditor agree,
if requested by the holders of the First Tier Indebtedness, to execute an
intercreditor and lien subordination agreement substantively similar to this
