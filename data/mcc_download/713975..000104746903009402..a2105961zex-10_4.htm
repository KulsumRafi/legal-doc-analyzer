constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election of each Director who was not a Director at the beginning of such period has been approved in advance by Directors representing not less than
two-thirds of the Directors then in office who were Directors at the beginning of the period, or (c)&nbsp;the Bank and/or the corporation shall be merged or consolidated or substantially
