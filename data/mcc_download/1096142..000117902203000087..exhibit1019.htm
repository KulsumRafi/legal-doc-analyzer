<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Consultant's
Covenants</u></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>No Conflicts.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consultant represents and warrants to Gentiva
that she is free to enter into this Agreement and that he has no other
commitment of any kind to anyone that would in any way hinder her acceptance
of, or the full performance of, her obligations under this Agreement, or the
exercise of her best efforts as a consultant to Gentiva.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Confidentiality.</u>&nbsp; Without the prior written consent of
Gentiva, Consultant shall not at any time (whether during or after the term of
this Agreement) use for her own benefit or purposes, or for the benefit or
purposes of any other person or entity other than Gentiva, or disclose (except
in the performance of her duties under this Agreement) in any manner to any
person or entity, any proprietary information belonging to or relating to the
affairs of Gentiva.&nbsp; Consultant shall
not disclose to any person or entity the nature of the project for which
Gentiva has engaged Consultant, or the specific inquiries which Consultant is
making for Gentiva (and the related responses received), or solicit the
engagement of Consultant or any of its employees by any potential competitors
of Gentiva in the field, where such solicitation is significantly based on the
information it shall have obtained in connection with the duties she is
performing for Gentiva.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Right to Materials.</u>&nbsp; At the request of Gentiva, Consultant shall

<p style="text-indent: 50" align="center">2</p>

<hr color="#0000FF">

<p>work products created by consultant in
connection with the Services shall be the exclusive property of Gentiva and
Consultant agrees to execute any documents reasonably requested by Gentiva to
evidence such ownership by Gentiva.&nbsp; The
provisions of this Section shall not apply to any information that is or
becomes available to the public through no act or omission of Consultant.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Remedies.</u>&nbsp; Consultant hereby acknowledges and confirms
that Gentiva's remedy at law for any breach of any of Consultant's obligations
under Sections 3.2 or 3.3 of this Agreement would be inadequate, and that
damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and consents that
temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in accordance with
equity in any proceeding which may be brought to enforce any provision of such
Sections, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.&nbsp; Consultant acknowledges that (i) Gentiva has
reserved and is to have the right to prove any damages which Gentiva is able to
prove resulting from any breach of any of Consultant's obligations under such
Sections, and (ii) the value of the consideration which Consultant is to
receive in connection with this Agreement is not to be considered as equivalent
to, or as evidence of, the amount of extent of any such damages.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Termination.</u>&nbsp; This Agreement shall terminate (a)
immediately upon notice by Gentiva, in the event of any material failure by
Consultant to observe or perform her obligations hereunder, or (b) immediately
upon notice by Consultant, in the event of any material failure by Gentiva to
observe or perform its obligations hereunder or (c) upon thirty (30) days
advance notice in writing by either party, with or without cause. Termination
shall not relieve either party of obligations already incurred.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Winding Up.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen days prior to the termination of
this Agreement, Consultant shall bring the Services hereunder to an orderly
termination or transition to such persons as Gentiva may designate and if
required, shall prepare a final report of the status of the projects hereunder.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Survival.</u>&nbsp; The provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.4
