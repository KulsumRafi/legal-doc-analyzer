                         AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE LOANS

      A.  THE LOANS

      Section 2.1 Revolving Loan.

      (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Lenders severally, but not jointly, agree to make revolving loans (each a
"Revolving Loan" and collectively "Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from time
to time during the period from the date of this Agreement up to, but not
including, the Maturity Date; provided, however, that at no time shall the
aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans plus the
Available Amount plus any unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceed the Borrowing
Base as in effect prior to the making of such Revolving Loan.  So long as (i)
the Borrower is in compliance with all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(whether or not Lenders have accelerated payment of the Loans) or would result,
and (iii) all other conditions set forth in Article 3 have been satisfied, the
Borrower may borrow, pay, prepay (pursuant to Section 2.1(d)), and re-borrow
under this Section 2.1.

      (b) The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by, and repaid with interest in
accordance with, two promissory notes of the Borrower, each substantially in the
forms of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto (each such promissory note is referred to
herein as a "Revolving Loan Note").  The Revolving Note issued to each Lender
shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to such Lender and be
dated the date of this Agreement, (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to
the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender, and be payable in the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the
Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of
Section 2.3 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Rate Loans, as the case
may be, evidenced thereby, and (vi) be entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower hereby authorizes each
Lender to record on its Revolving Loan Note or in its internal computerized
records the amount of each Revolving Loan and of each payment of principal
received by such Lender on account of the Revolving Loans, which recordation
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as to the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Loans evidenced thereby and shall be
considered correct and binding on the Borrower provided, however, that the
failure to make such recordation with respect to any Revolving Loan or payment
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement or any Revolving Loan Note.

      (c) The Borrower shall establish a loan account with Agent which account
shall be deemed to be the Revolving Loan Account.  Insofar as the Borrower may
request and the Lenders shall make Revolving Loans hereunder, the Agent shall
enter such loans as debits to the Revolving Loan Account and shall deposit such
loans in the operating account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent.  The
Agent shall also record in the Revolving Loan Account, in accordance with
customary accounting procedures, (i) all other charges, expenses and other Liens
properly chargeable to the Borrower for which the Agent debits the Revolving
Loan Account, (ii) all

                                      -20-

<PAGE>
payments made on account of the Revolving Loans, (iii) all proceeds of
Collateral which are finally paid to the Agent in its office in cash, and (iv)
other appropriate debits and credits.  The Revolving Loan Account shall reflect
the amount of the Borrower's Indebtedness to the Lenders from time to time by
reason of the Revolving Loans less Revolving Loan repayments, and other
appropriate charges hereunder.

      (d) The Borrower may prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of prepayment on the amount prepaid
(i) with respect to any principal portion that bears interest with reference to
the Base Rate, on any Business Day, without Make- Whole Premium, and (ii) with
respect to any principal portion that bears interest with reference to LIBOR
either (1) on the last Business Day of the Interest Period applicable to the
portion being prepaid, without Make-Whole Premium or (2) on any other Business
Day, together with the Make- Whole Premium.

      (e) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the pro rata account of the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Loan Commitments, a fee
(the "Unused Line Fee") equal to the rate per annum specified for the Unused
Line Fee (bps) in the table in Section 2.3 times the average daily unused
portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments for the period from the Closing Date
through and including the Maturity Date or any earlier date of termination in
full of the Revolving Loan Commitments.  The Unused Line Fee shall be payable
quarterly in arrears within ten (10) days of the end of each fiscal quarter of
the Borrower and on the Maturity Date or any earlier date of termination in full
of the Revolving Loan Commitments.

      Section 2.2A Term Loan A.

      (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Lenders shall, on the date hereof, severally, but not jointly, make a term loan

      (b) Term Loan A shall be evidenced by, and repaid in accordance with, two
promissory notes of the Borrower, each substantially in the forms attached
hereto as Exhibits B-1 and B-2 (each such note a "Term Loan A Note").  The Term
Loan A Note issued to each Lender shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be
payable to such Lender and be dated the date hereof, (iii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Term Loan A Commitment of such Lender and be
payable as provided in Section 2.2A(c), (iv) mature on the Maturity Date, (v)
bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 2.3 in respect of
the Base Rate or LIBOR, as the case may be, and (vi) be entitled to the benefits
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      (c) The Borrower shall make equal quarterly payments under the Term Loan A
Notes of principal plus accrued interest in accordance with a fifteen year
amortization schedule, commencing April 1, 2003 and continuing on the first
Business Day of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter through and including
September 1, 2005 until the outstanding principal amount of Term Loan A,
together with all interest accrued thereon, has been fully paid, except that if
not sooner paid, the principal amount, together with all accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

      (d) The Borrower may prepay any portion of the outstanding principal of
Term Loan A, in whole or in part, together with accrued interest to the date of

reference to LIBOR either (1) on the last Business Day of the Interest Period
applicable to the portion of Term Loan A being prepaid, without the Make-Whole
Premium or (2) on any other Business Day, together with the Make-Whole Premium.
All prepayments of Term Loan A shall be applied first to payment of the next
installment due thereunder and then to the rest of the installments thereof in
the inverse order of their maturity.

      Section 2.2B Term Loan B.

      (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Lenders shall, on the date hereof, severally, but not jointly, make a term loan
to the Borrower ("Term Loan B") (Term Loan A and Term Loan B are collectively
referred to herein as the "Term Loans") in an original principal amount of Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

      (b) Term Loan B shall be evidenced by, and repaid in accordance with, two
promissory notes of the Borrower, each substantially in the forms attached
hereto as Exhibit C-1 and C-2 (each such note a "Term Loan B Note").  The Term
Loan B Note issued to each Lender shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be
payable to such Lender and be dated the date hereof, (iii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Term Loan B Commitment of such Lender and be
payable as provided in Section 2.2B(c), (iv) mature on the Maturity Date, (v)
bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 2.3 in respect of
the Base Rate or LIBOR, as the case may be, and (vi) be entitled to the benefits
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      (c) Commencing April 1, 2003 and continuing on the first Business Day of

quarterly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, in accordance with a
seven year amortization schedule, until the outstanding principal amount of the
Term Loan B Notes, together with all interest accrued thereon, has been fully
paid, except that if not sooner paid, the principal amount, together with all
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

      (d) The Borrower may prepay any portion of the outstanding principal of
Term Loan B, in whole or in part, together with accrued interest to the date of
such prepayment on the amount prepaid and all amounts required under Section
2.15, (i) with respect to any principal portion that bears interest with
reference to the Base Rate, on any Business Day, without the Make-Whole Premium,

      (a) Commencing with the first such date following the date of this

Compliance evidencing such change.  If the Borrower shall fail to deliver a
Certificate of Compliance within five days of the due date thereof in accordance

Base Rate Margin shall be one-quarter percent (0.25%) from the day such
Certificate of Compliance was due until the day a Certificate of Compliance

Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan as the Borrower may request pursuant to

hereunder at any time.  For purposes of the foregoing, LIBOR Rate Loans having
different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same
date, shall be considered separate LIBOR Rate Loans.  Each LIBOR Rate Loan shall

is 250 basis points and the Base Rate Margin is zero percent (0%).

Base Rate changes.  Any change in the interest rate resulting from a change in
the Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on
which such change in the Base Rate shall become effective.

      (c) Overdue principal and interest and, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, after a period of five (5) days all
principal and accrued but unpaid interest shall bear interest until paid in
full, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.

      (d) The Agent may collect for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a "late
charge" equal to five percent (5%) of any installment of interest or principal
or any other amount due hereunder which is not paid or reimbursed by the
Borrower within ten (10) days of the due date thereof to cover the extra expense
involved in handling such delinquent payment.

      Section 2.4 Notice and Manner of Borrowing; Conversion or Continuation of
Interest Rate.

      (a) The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice by telephone or
facsimile from an officer of the Borrower (or any Person authorized by the
Borrower pursuant to a written list provided to the Agent) of its request that
the Lenders make a Revolving Loan in a specific amount (each a "Borrowing
Request") not later than 11:00 a.m.  Connecticut time (i) in the case of Base
Rate Loans, on the proposed date thereof, and (ii) in the case of LIBOR Rate
Loans, three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed date thereof.  Each such
notice shall, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, specify the duration of the
Interest Period therefor.  If no election is made in a Borrowing Request as to
the Type applicable to any Revolving Loan, then the requested Revolving Loan
shall be a Base Rate Loan.  If no election is made in a Borrowing Request as to
the Interest Period applicable to any requested LIBOR Rate Loan, then the
Interest Period applicable to such requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall (subject to
the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1)
be one month in duration.  Promptly after its receipt of a Borrowing Request,
the Agent shall notify each Lender of the contents of such Borrowing Request and
of such Lender's share of the Revolving Loan requested thereby.  On the date
requested by the Borrower for such Revolving Loan, each Lender shall make
available to the Agent, at the Head Office, such Lender's share of such
Revolving Loan.  Subject to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set
forth in Article 3, the Agent will make the proceeds received by it from the
Lenders in respect of such Revolving Loan available to the Borrower on such date
by crediting such proceeds to the Borrower's account with the Agent.  The
Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender and hold each of them
harmless from any claims or damages, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, arising as a result of the Agent's or any Lender's acting on
any request which the Agent believes to have been made by any Person authorized
by the Borrower pursuant to a written list provided to the Agent.

      (b) Within not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice by telephone or facsimile
from an officer of the Borrower (or any Person authorized by the Borrower
pursuant to a written list provided to the Agent), of

                                      -24-

<PAGE>
its selection of the initial requested interest rate for each of Term Loan A
and Term Loan B.  Such notice shall, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, specify
the duration of the Interest Period therefor.  If no election is made by the
Borrower prior to the Closing Date as to the Type applicable to Term Loan A or
Term Loan B, then such Term Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.  If no election is
made as to the Interest Period applicable to any requested LIBOR Rate Loan,
then the Interest Period applicable to such requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall
(subject to the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in
Section 1.1) be one month in duration.  Promptly upon receipt of notice from
the Borrower as to the Type applicable to Term Loan A or Term Loan B, the Agent
shall notify each Lender of Borrower's request, and such Lender shall make
available to the Agent, on the Closing Date at the Head Office, such Lender's
Term Loan A Commitment and Term Loan B Commitment.  Subject to the fulfillment
of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, the Agent will make the
proceeds received by it from the Lenders in respect of the Term Loans available
to the Borrower on the Closing Date by crediting such proceeds to the
Borrower's account with the Agent.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent
and each Lender and hold each of them harmless from any claims or damages,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, arising as a result
of the Agent's or any Lender's acting on any request which the Agent believes
to have been made by any Person authorized by the Borrower pursuant to a
written list provided to the Agent.

      (c) The Borrower may (x) on any Business Day, convert any outstanding Base
Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan in the same aggregate principal amount, (y) on
the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto,
continue any LIBOR Rate Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan and (z) convert a LIBOR Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan on the last Business Day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; provided, that a Base Rate Loan may
not be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan and a LIBOR Rate Loan may not be continued
as such if any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or
there would not be compliance with Section 2.3(a).  If the Borrower desires to
convert a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan or continue a LIBOR Rate Loan
pursuant to this Section 2.4(c), it shall give the Agent (which shall promptly
notify each of the Lenders) not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written
notice, specifying the date of such conversion or continuation, the amount to be
converted or continued and if conversion is from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR
Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan is to be continued, the duration of the Interest
Period therefor.  If, not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the end of
the Interest Period then in effect for any LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall
not have delivered to the Agent (i) a notice requesting conversion of a LIBOR
Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan in accordance with this Section 2.4(c), (ii) a
notice requesting that such Loan be continued as a Loan of the same Type having
an Interest Period of the same or a different duration than the Interest Period
in effect, in accordance with this Section 2.4(c), or (iii) a notice that such
Loan is to be paid at the end of such Interest Period, then, in each such case,
the Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a notice that such Loan is to be
converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) and the Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of such deemed notice.

      Section 2.5 Excess Advances.  If at any time the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans plus the Available Amount plus any
unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay the Revolving Loans in the

                                      -25-

<PAGE>
amount of such excess, together with accrued interest to the date of prepayment
on the amount prepaid and, with respect to any portion of such prepayment that
bears interest with reference to LIBOR, any Make-Whole Premium.

      B.  CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS

      Section 2.6 Taxes

      (a) All payments by the Borrower under the Loan Documents to or for the
account of the Agent or any Lender shall be made without setoff or counterclaim
and free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any and all present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments, deductions, withholdings, or other charges
of whatever nature, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld, or
assessed by any jurisdiction, or by any department, agency, state or other
political subdivision thereof or therein (collectively, "Taxes"), excluding (i)
a Tax on the Income imposed on the Agent or any Lender, and (ii) any interest,
fees, additions to tax or penalties for late payment thereof (each such
non-excluded Tax, an "Indemnified Tax").  For purposes hereof, "Tax on the
Income" shall mean, as to any Person, a Tax imposed by one of the following
jurisdictions or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof:  (i)
the United States, (ii) the jurisdiction in which such Person is organized, or
(iii) the jurisdiction in which such Person's principal office is located, which
Tax is an income tax or franchise tax imposed on all or part of the net income
or net profits of such Person or which Tax represents interest, fees, or
penalties for late payment of such an income tax or franchise tax.  If any such
obligation is imposed upon the Borrower with respect to any amount payable by it
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to
each Lender on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder or
under such other Loan Document, such additional amount in Dollars as shall be
necessary to enable such Lender to receive the same net amount which such Lender
would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon
the Borrower.  The Borrower will deliver promptly to the Agent certificates or
other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with
respect to payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan
Document.

      (b) If the Borrower, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person is required
by any law, rule, regulation, order, directive, treaty or guideline to make any
deduction or withholding (which deduction or withholding would constitute an
Indemnified Tax) from any amount required to be paid by the Borrower to or on
behalf of the Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document, (i) the Borrower
shall pay such Indemnified Tax before the date on which penalties attach
thereto, such payment to be made for its own account (if the liability to pay is
imposed on the Borrower) or on behalf of and in the name of the Agent or any
Lender (if the liability is imposed on the Agent or such Lender, and (ii) the
sum payable to the Agent or such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary
so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 2.6) the Agent or such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

      (c) The Borrower agrees to pay any current or future stamp or documentary
taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that
arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver
or consent under or in respect of the Loan Documents or otherwise with respect
to, the Loan Documents (collectively, the "Other Taxes").

      (d) Within thirty (30) days after the request therefor by the Agent or any
Lender in connection with any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the
Borrower will furnish to the Agent or such Lender the original or certified copy
of an official receipt from the jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing
payment thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate from its chief financial
officer or president that states that such payment has been made and that sets
forth the date and amount of such payment.

      (e) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in its reasonable judgment, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

      (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
this Section 2.6 shall survive the payment in full of Obligations and the
termination of the Commitments.

      (g) If requested by the Borrower, the Agent shall use its best efforts to
provide the Borrower with such Internal Revenue Service forms as are reasonably
necessary for the Borrower to fulfill its obligations hereunder, but the failure
of the Agent to provide such forms shall not in any way relieve or postpone the
Borrower's obligations hereunder.

      Section 2.7 Computations.  All computations of interest on the Loans and
of fees or other charges shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the
actual number of days elapsed.

      Section 2.8 Additional Payments.  If any present or future applicable law,
statute, rule or regulation thereunder or any interpretation thereof by any
competent court or by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration
or the interpretation thereof, or any request, directive, instruction or notice
at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to the
Agent or any Lender by any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

      (a) subject the Agent or any Lender to any tax, levy, impost, duty,
charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, any Commitment or
the Loans (other than taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of
the Agent or such Lender and imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal
office is located), or

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

      (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in taxes
on income or profits imposed by the jurisdiction in which the Agent's or any
Lender's principal office is located) of payments to the Agent or any Lender of
the principal of or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to
the Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or

      (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the extent
specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any special deposit,
reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar requirements
(whether or not having the force of law) against assets held by, or deposits in
or for the account of, or loans by, or letters of credit issued by, or
commitments of an office of the Agent or any Lender, or

      (d) impose on the Agent or any Lender any other conditions or requirements
with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans, any Letters
of Credit, any Commitment or any class of loans, letters of credit or
commitments of which any of the Loans, any Letters of Credit or any Commitment
forms a part,

and the result of any of the foregoing is

             (i) to increase the cost to the Agent or such Lender of making,
      funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining the Loans, any
      Letters of Credit or any Commitment by an amount the Agent or such Lender
      reasonably deems to be material; or

             (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest, or other amount
      payable to the Agent or such Lender hereunder on account of the Loans, any
      Letters of Credit or any Commitment by an amount the Agent or such Lender
      reasonably deems to be material; or

             (iii) to require the Agent or such Lender to make any payment or to
      forego any interest or fee or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of
      which payment of foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference
      to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by the Agent
      or such Lender from the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, upon demand made by the Agent or
such Lender at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion
therefor may arise, pay to the Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as
will be sufficient to compensate the Agent or such Lender for such additional
cost, reduction, payment, foregone interest or other sum.

      Section 2.9 Capital Adequacy.  If any Lender shall have determined that
(i) the adoption of or any change in any applicable law, governmental rule,
regulation or order regarding capital adequacy of banks or bank holding
companies, or (ii) any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any applicable governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, or
(iii) compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy, whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to
comply therewith would be unlawful, so long as such Lender believes in good
faith that such has the force of law or that the failure to so comply would be
unlawful, has or would have the effect of reducing the

                                      -28-

<PAGE>
rate of return on such Lender's capital as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance, taking into consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy immediately before such
adoption, change or compliance and assuming that such Lender's capital was
fully utilized prior to such adoption, change or compliance, by an amount
deemed by such Lender in its reasonable judgment to be material, then, upon
demand, the Borrower shall pay immediately to such Lender, from time to time as
specified by such Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such reduced return, together with interest on each
such amount from the date of such specification by such Lender until payment in
full thereof at the then current rate of interest applicable to Base Rate
Loans.  In determining such amount, each Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

      Section 2.10 Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if,
at any time, it becomes illegal for any Lender to make or maintain any Loan as a
LIBOR Rate Loan, such Lender shall give the Borrower and the Agent written,
telephonic or facsimile notice of such condition.  Following such notice and
until such Lender has given the Borrower and the Agent written notice of the
termination of such condition, (a) no LIBOR Rate Loans shall be available
hereunder (and no Lender shall be under any obligation to make or continue, or
to convert any Loans to, LIBOR Rate Loans), (b) all Loans which were to be made
or continued as, or converted to, LIBOR Rate Loans shall instead be made or
continued as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans, and (c) if any Loan is then
outstanding as a LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, promptly upon request from
the affected Lender, either prepay such LIBOR Rate Loan in full, together with
accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment, or, at the
Borrower's option, convert such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan.  If any
such prepayment or conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan is made on a day that is not
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower shall compensate each
Lender as provided in Section 2.15 as a result of such prepayment or conversion.

      Section 2.11 Certificate; Protection.  A certificate setting forth any
amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.8, 2.9 or 2.15 and a brief explanation of
such amounts which are due, submitted by the Agent or a Lender to the Borrower,
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing
and of the amounts due.  The protection of Sections 2.8 and 2.9 shall be
available to the Agent and each Lender regardless of any possible contention of
the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, agreement
guideline or other change or condition which shall have been imposed or shall
have occurred.  The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.15
shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the
Commitments.

      Section 2.12 Obligations Absolute.  The obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents under all circumstances, and irrespective of the following
circumstances:

      (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of all or any portion of this
Agreement or any other agreement or any instrument relating hereto;

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

      (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other
term of, all or any of the Obligations;

      (c) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the
Borrower may have; or

      (d) any amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any of the
Loan Documents, or all or any of the Obligations in respect of the Loans or this
Agreement.

      C.  MISCELLANEOUS

      Section 2.13 Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Loans made hereunder
shall be used by the Borrower for itself or for its Subsidiaries (i) to
refinance existing term and revolving credit indebtedness of the Borrower to
Wachovia Bank, National Association (f/k/a First Union National Bank), (ii) to
support the Borrower's working capital requirements and trading assets, and
(iii) to purchase equipment.  The Letters of Credit shall finance the Borrower's
purchase of goods in the ordinary course of its business.  The Borrower will
not, directly or indirectly, use any part of the proceeds of any of the Loans,
or any Letter of Credit, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin
stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or to extend credit to any Person for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any such margin stock.

      Section 2.14 Termination.  The Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
automatically terminated on the Maturity Date.  The Term Loan Commitments shall
be automatically terminated on the Closing Date.

      Section 2.15 Indemnification.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent
and each Lender and to hold the Agent and each Lender harmless from any loss or
expense which the Agent or such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of
(a) default by the Borrower in payment when due of the principal amount of, or
interest on, any LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) default by the Borrower in making a
borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan after the
Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, (c) default by the Borrower in making any
prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans, or (d) the making of a payment, prepayment or
conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans on a day which is not the last Business Day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in each
case, any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment or repayment of
funds obtained by the Agent or any Lender or from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which funds were obtained.

      Section 2.16 Termination of Revolving Loans.  In the event that the
Borrower pays or prepays any Revolving Loan in full on or prior to the Maturity
Date and terminates the Revolving Loan Commitments, and if on the date of such
payment any Letter of Credit is outstanding, the Borrower shall pay an amount to
the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders equal to the

                                      -30-

<PAGE>
Available Amount under such Letter of Credit on such date as cash collateral
for such Letter of Credit.  Such amount shall be held by the Agent as provided
in Section 2.18(i).

      Section 2.17 Replacement of Lenders.  (x) If any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender or otherwise defaults in its obligations to make Loans, (y)
upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.8 or
2.9 with respect to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to the
Borrower increased costs materially in excess of those being generally charged
by any other Lender or (z) in the case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by each other Lender as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 11.1, the Borrower shall have the right, if no
Default or Event of Default then exists (or, in the case of preceding clause
(z), will exist immediately after giving effect to such replacement), to replace
such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with one or more Eligible Transferees, none
of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement
(collectively, the "Replacement Lender") and each of whom shall be required to
be reasonably acceptable to the Agent, provided that (i) at the time of any
replacement pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Replacement Lender shall enter
into one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section 11.4
(and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 11.4 to be paid by the
Borrower and/or the Replacement Lender (as may be agreed to at such time by and
between the Borrower and the Replacement Lender)) pursuant to which the
Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the Commitments and outstanding Loans
of, and participations in Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and, in
connection therewith, shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an
amount equal to the sum of (I) an amount equal to the principal of, and all
accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, (II) an
amount equal to all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations that have been funded by
(and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with all then unpaid
interest with respect thereto at such time, and (III) an amount equal to all
accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender, and (y) if
the Replaced Lender has a Revolving Loan Commitment which is being replaced, the
Issuing Lender an amount equal to such Replaced Lender's percentage of any
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations (which at such time remains an Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligation) to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded
by such Replaced Lender to the Issuing Lender at such time (other than those
specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment
purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full
to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement, and (ii) the
Replaced Lender shall receive (x) all amounts payable to the Replaced Lender
pursuant to Section 2.15 as if the amounts paid pursuant to clause (i) above
were a prepayment and (y) all amounts then payable to the Replaced Lender
pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9.  Upon the execution of the respective
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment of amounts referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and, unless
the Replaced Lender is being replaced with respect to less than all of the
tranches in which it participates, the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute
a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this
Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.

      D.  LETTERS OF CREDIT

      Section 2.18 Letters of Credit.

      (a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing
Lender shall issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower; provided,
however, that the Issuing Lender will not issue any Letters of Credit to the
extent that the issuance of such Letters of Credit would then cause the sum of
(i) the outstanding Revolving Loans plus (ii) the Letter of Credit Obligations
(with the requested Letter of Credit being deemed to be outstanding for purposes
of this calculation) to exceed the Borrowing Base in effect prior to the
issuance of the requested Letter of Credit or would then cause the Letter of
Credit Obligations (with the requested Letter of Credit being deemed to be
outstanding for purposes of this calculation) to exceed the L/C Sublimit.
Letters of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest.

      (b) Request.  In order to request the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall deliver to the Issuing
Lender, with a copy to the Agent, a letter of credit application on the Issuing
Lender's then customary form (the "Letter of Credit Application"), completed by
the Borrower, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference; provided,
however, that in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of the Letter of Credit Applications, the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

      (c) Form.  Each Letter of Credit shall, among other things, (1) be on the
Issuing Lender's then customary form, (2) provide for the payment of sight
drafts for honor thereunder when presented in accordance with the terms thereof
and when accompanied by the documents described therein, and (3) be subject to
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No.
500) and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of
Connecticut.

      (d) Expiry Dates.  Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date of the
earlier of (i) the date which is not later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the date of issuance and (ii) the Maturity Date.

      (e) Reimbursement Obligation.  In order to induce the Issuing Lender to
issue, extend or renew the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby agrees and
promises to reimburse or pay to the Issuing Lender, with respect to each Letter
of Credit issued, extended or renewed hereunder, on each date that any draft or
demand presented or made under such Letter of Credit is honored by the Issuing
Lender, or on which the Issuing Lender otherwise makes a payment with respect
thereto, (i) the amount paid by the Issuing Lender under or with respect to such
Letter of Credit, and (ii) the amount of any taxes, fees, charges or other costs
and expenses whatsoever incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with any
payment made by the Issuing Lender under, or with respect to, such Letter of
Credit (collectively, the "Reimbursement Obligations").  Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Default Rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans.

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

      (f) Letter of Credit Fees.  In the event that the Issuing Lender issues,
extends or renews any Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (whether
collectively or individually), the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender on
the date of such issuance, extension or renewal, a fee of one eighth percent
(0.125%) per annum.  In addition, the Borrower shall remit to the Lenders a fee
equal to the applicable LIBOR Rate Margin, as in effect from time to time times
the maximum face amount of each Letter of Credit, which fee shall be payable
monthly in arrears on each day that interest on Base Rate Loans is payable
hereunder.  The Borrower shall also pay the Issuing Lender's usual and customary
administration and negotiation fees with respect to each Letter of Credit.  The
fees specified in this Section 2.18(f) shall be referred to herein as "Letter of
Credit Fees."

      (g) Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of the Borrower under
Section 2.18(e) and Section 2.18(f) shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with this Agreement,
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of and neither the Issuing
Lender nor the Agent nor any Lender shall be liable or responsible for:  (1) any
lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any other Loan
Document, or any term or provision therein; (2) any amendment or waiver of or
any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of
Credit or any other Loan Document; (3) the existence of any dispute, claim,
setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing,
or otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under
any Letter of Credit, against the Issuing Lender, the Agent or any Lender or
against any other Person whatsoever, whether in connection with this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or
transaction; (4) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
or any endorsement thereon proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
in any respect; (5) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit; (6) any error, omission, interruption or delay
in any transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit; and (7) any other act or
omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Lender, the Agent, or any
Lender or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
provisions of this subsection, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
Borrower's obligations hereunder.

      The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing
Lender, the Agent or any Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit
and the related drafts and documents, if done in good faith, shall be binding
upon the Borrower and shall not result in any liability on the part of the
Issuing Lender, the Agent or any Lender to the Borrower.  It is understood that
the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in
order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any
Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing Lender's exclusive reliance on the documents
presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth
therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such
Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due the beneficiary thereunder
equals the amount of such draft and

                                      -33-

<PAGE>
whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves
to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be
in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document
presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or
any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect
whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the
documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall,
in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct, gross negligence
or bad faith of or by the Issuing Lender.

      (h) Reliance by the Issuing Lender.  The Issuing Lender shall be entitled
to rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon (without responsibility for
further investigation), any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper person or persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Issuing Lender.

      (i) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives notice from the
Agent thereof and of the amount to be deposited (or automatically on the
occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Section 9.1(6)), deposit in an
account with the Agent an amount in cash equal to the Available Amount as of
such date.  Such deposit, and any amount deposited pursuant to Section 2.16,
shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of all
Reimbursement Obligations then arising or which in the future arise for any and
all outstanding Letters of Credit.  The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Such
deposits shall not bear interest.  Moneys in such account shall automatically be
remitted by the Agent from time to time to the Issuing Lender for application by
the Issuing Lender to any Reimbursement Obligations for which the Issuing Lender
has not otherwise been reimbursed, or, at the Agent's sole discretion, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated and there are no Letter of Credit
Obligations, to satisfy any other Obligations.  If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral under this subsection as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount shall be returned to the Borrower
within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
waived.

      Section 2.19 Letter of Credit Participations.

      (a) Immediately upon the issuance by the Issuing Lender of any Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each
Lender, and each Lender (in its capacity under this Section 2.19, a
"Participant") shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased
and received from the Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest and participation, to the extent of such Participant's Revolving Loan
Commitment percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing or payment made
thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect
thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto.  Upon any
change in the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Lenders, it is hereby agreed
that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations relating thereto, there shall be an automatic

                                      -34-

<PAGE>
adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 2.19 to reflect the
new Revolving Loan Commitment percentages of the assignor and assignee Lender,
as the case may be.

      (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Lender shall not have any obligation relative to the other Lenders other than to
confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit
appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on
their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.  Any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter
of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting
liability to the Borrower, any Affiliate, any Lender or any other Person unless
such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

      (c) In the event that the Issuing Lender makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such
amount in full to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, the Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify the Agent, which shall promptly notify each
Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and
unconditionally pay to the Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's
Revolving Loan Commitment percentage of such unreimbursed payment in lawful
money of the United States and in immediately available funds.  If the Agent so
notifies, prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on any Business Day, any
Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit, such
Participant shall make available to such Issuing Lender in lawful money of the
United States and in immediately available funds such Participant's Revolving
Loan Commitment percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day.
If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its Revolving Loan
Commitment percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Issuing
Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender, forthwith on
demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date
until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender at the overnight
Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days and at the interest rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter.  The failure of any
Participant to make available to the Issuing Lender its Revolving Loan
Commitment percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not
relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to
the Issuing Lender its Revolving Loan Commitment percentage of any payment under
any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no
Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other Participant to
make available to the Issuing Lender such other Participant's Revolving Loan
Commitment percentage of any such payment.

      (d) Whenever the Issuing Lender receives a payment of a Reimbursement
Obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants
pursuant to clause (c) above, the Issuing Lender shall pay to each Participant
which has paid its Revolving Loan Commitment percentage thereof, in lawful money
of the United States and in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such
Participant's share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally
funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants)
of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon
accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

      (e) Upon the request of any Participant, the Issuing Lender shall furnish
to such Participant copies of any Letter of Credit issued by it and such other
documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.

      (f) The obligations of the Participants to make payments to the Issuing
Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not be subject
to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

             (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
      of the other Loan Documents;

             (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
      which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against
      a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of
      Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the
      Agent, any Participant, or any other Person, whether in connection with
      this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein
      or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction
      between the Borrower or any Subsidiary and the beneficiary named in any
      such Letter of Credit);

             (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under
      any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
      insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
      inaccurate in any respect;

             (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the
      performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan
      Documents; or

             (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default which is
      continuing.

substantially as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, and
neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor is in violation of any rights of others
with respect to any of the foregoing except where the failure to possess such

claims have been received by the Borrower's or any Guarantor's officers or
directors to the effect that (i) any product, process, method, substance, part
or other material presently contemplated to be sold by or employed by it in
connection with such business may infringe any Patent, Trademark, service mark,

contesting its right to sell or use any such

                                      -41-

<PAGE>
product, process, method, substance, part or other material where such claim or
litigation, if decided adversely to the Borrower or any Guarantor, would have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) there has been any infringement or violation

right owned by the Borrower or any Guarantor which if continuing, would have a

in Regulations U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin
security, or for any other purpose which might cause any of the Loans or any of
the Letters of Credit to be considered a "purpose credit" within the meaning of
Regulation T, U, or X of the Federal Reserve Board.  Less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Borrower's or any Guarantor's assets and none of the
Collateral or any collateral covered by the Guarantor Security Agreement
constitute margin securities.  The Borrower will neither take, nor permit any
Guarantor or any agent acting on its behalf to take, any action which might

the Federal Reserve Board.

and the Secured Guarantors represent or warrant to be an Eligible Account
Receivable in each Borrowing Base Certificate or other certification delivered
by the Borrower and the Secured Guarantors pursuant to this Agreement will be,

compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA.
Neither a Reportable Event nor

                              GRANT OF COLLATERAL

      Section 8.1 Grant of Security Interest.

      (a) Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, as collateral security for the
prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower
hereby grants to the Lenders Security Interests in and Liens upon all of its
properties, assets and rights, wherever located, whether real or personal,
tangible or intangible, and whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or in which
it now has or at any time in the future may acquire any right, title, or
interest, including, all of the following property in which it now has or at any
time in the future may acquire any right, title or interest:  all Accounts,
Chattel Paper, Commodity Accounts, Commodity Contracts, Deposit Accounts,
Documents, Electronic Chattel Paper, Equipment, Fixtures, General Intangibles,
Goods, Health-care Insurance Receivables, Instruments, Intellectual Property,
Inventory, Investment Properties, Letter-of-Credit Rights, Payment Intangibles,
Promissory Notes, Software, Supporting Obligations, Tangible Chattel Paper,
Certificated Securities, Financial Assets, Negotiable Instruments, Securities
Accounts, Securities, Security Entitlements and Uncertificated Securities; and
to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds and products of all and any
of the foregoing and all collateral security and guarantees given by any Person
with respect to any of the foregoing (all of the foregoing, together with any
other collateral pledged to the Lender pursuant to any other Financing
Agreement, collectively, the "Collateral").

      (b) The Borrower and Lenders agree that this Agreement creates, and is
intended to create, valid and continuing Liens upon the Collateral in favor of
Lenders.  The Borrower represents, warrants and promises to Lenders that:  (i)
the Borrower is the sole owner of each item of the Collateral upon which it
purports to grant a Lien pursuant to the Loan Documents, and has good and
marketable title thereto free and clear of any and all Liens or claims of
others, other than Permitted Encumbrances or Liens being released on the Closing
Date; (ii) the Security Interests granted pursuant to this Agreement constitute
valid perfected Security Interests in all of the Collateral in favor of the
Lenders as security for the prompt and complete payment and performance of the
Obligations, enforceable in accordance with the terms hereof against any and all
creditors of and purchasers from the Borrower, and such Security Interests are
prior to all other Liens on the Collateral in existence on the date hereof
except for Permitted Encumbrances and those being released on the Closing Date
which have priority by operation of law; and (iii) no effective security
agreement, financing statement, equivalent security or Lien instrument or
continuation statement covering all or any part of the Collateral is or will be
on file or of record in any public office, except those relating to Permitted
Encumbrances.  The Borrower promises to defend the right, title and interest of
the Lenders in and to the Collateral against the claims and demands of all
Persons whomsoever, and shall take such actions, including (x) the prompt

                                      -55-

<PAGE>
delivery of all original Instruments, Chattel Paper and certificated Stock owned
by the Borrower to Lenders, (y) notification of Lenders' interest in Collateral
at Lenders' request, and (z) the institution of litigation against third parties
as shall be prudent in order to protect and preserve the Borrower's and Lenders'
respective and several interests in the Collateral.  The Borrower shall mark its
Books and Records pertaining to the Collateral to evidence the Loan Documents
and the Liens granted under the Loan Documents.

      8.2 The Mortgage.  As additional collateral security for the prompt and
complete payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower hereby grants
to the Lenders all of its rights, title and interest now owned or hereafter
acquired in and to that certain property known as 110 Richards Avenue, Norwalk,
Connecticut, pursuant to the terms of that certain Open-End Mortgage Deed and
Security Agreement dated the date hereof by and among the Borrower and Lenders
(the "Mortgage").

      8.3 Lenders' Rights.

      (a) Any Lender may, (i) at any time in such Lender's own name or in the
name of the Borrower, communicate with Account Debtors, parties to Contracts,
and obligors in respect of Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral to
verify to such Lender's satisfaction, the existence, amount and terms of any
such Accounts, Contracts, Instruments or Chattel Paper or other Collateral, and
(ii) after an Event of Default which is continuing, at any time and without
prior notice to the Borrower, notify Account Debtors, parties to Contracts, and
obligors in respect of Chattel Paper, Instruments, or other Collateral that the
Collateral has been assigned to the Lenders and that payments shall be made
directly to the Agent.  Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall so
notify such Account Debtors, parties to Contracts, and obligors in respect of
Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral.  The Borrower hereby constitutes
each Lender or Lender's designee as the Borrower's attorney with power to
endorse the Borrower's name upon any notes, acceptance drafts, money orders or
other evidences of payment or Collateral.

      (b) It is expressly agreed by the Borrower that, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall remain liable under each Contract,
Instrument and License to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations
to be observed and performed by it thereunder, and Lenders shall have no
obligation or liability whatsoever to any Person under any Contract, Instrument
or License (between the Borrower and any Person other than Lenders) by reason of
or arising out of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, and
Lenders shall not be required or obligated in any manner (i) to perform or
fulfill any of the obligations of the Borrower, (ii) to make any payment or
inquiry, or (iii) to take any action of any kind to collect or enforce any
performance or the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to them
or to which they may be entitled at any time or times under or pursuant to any
Contract, Instrument or License.

      (c) The Borrower shall, with respect to each owned, leased, or controlled
property or facility, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice (unless a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which event
no notice shall be required and Lenders shall have access at any and all times):
(i) provide access to such facility or property to Lenders and

                                      -56-

<PAGE>
any of their officers, employees and agents, as frequently as Lenders determine
to be appropriate; (ii) permit the Lenders and any of their officers, employees
and agents to inspect, audit and make extracts from all of the Borrower's Books
and Records; and (iii) permit Lenders to inspect, review, evaluate and make
physical verifications and appraisals of the Collateral in any manner and
through any medium that any Lender considers advisable, and the Borrower agrees
to render to each Lender, at the Borrower's cost and expense, such clerical and
other assistance as may be reasonably requested with regard thereto.  The
Borrower shall make available to Lenders and their counsel, as quickly as
practicable under the circumstances, originals or copies of all the Borrower's
Books and Records and any other instruments and documents which any Lender may
request.  The Borrower shall deliver any document or instrument reasonably
necessary for Lenders, as they may from time to time reasonably request, to
obtain records from any service bureau or other Person which maintains records
for the Borrower.

      8.4 Lenders' Appointment as Attorney-in-fact.  On the Closing Date the
Borrower shall execute and deliver a Power of Attorney in the form attached as
Exhibit G.  The power of attorney granted pursuant to the Power of Attorney and
all powers granted under any Loan Documents are powers coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable until the Maturity Date.  The powers conferred on the
Agent for the Lenders under the Power of Attorney are solely to protect Lenders'
interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise
any such powers.  Agent agrees and promises that (a) it shall not exercise any
power or authority granted under the Power of Attorney unless an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) Agent shall only exercise the powers
granted under the Power of Attorney in respect of Collateral, provided, except
as otherwise required by applicable law, Agent shall not have any duty as to any
Collateral, and Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually
receives as a result of the exercise of such powers.  NONE OF AGENT OR IT
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE
TO THE BORROWER FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT PURSUANT TO THE POWERS GRANTED
UNDER THE POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT FOR ITS OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, NOR FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES.  The Borrower also hereby authorizes Agent and any Lender to file any
financing or continuation statement without the signature of the Borrower to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

      Each of the following shall be an "Event of Default":

             (1) The Borrower shall fail to pay the principal of, premium, if
      any, or interest on the Notes, or any amount of any fee, or any other
      liability or indebtedness owing by the Borrower to the Agent or any Lender
      as set forth herein or in the Notes, which in the

                                      -57-

<PAGE>
      case of any payment except the principal of any Loan or any Reimbursement
      Obligation, continues for more than ten (10) days;

             (2) Any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the
      Borrower or any Guarantor in any of the Loan Documents, or which is
      contained in any certificate, document, opinion, report, or financial or
      other statement furnished at any time under or in connection with any Loan
      Document, shall have been false in any material respect on or as of the
      date made or deemed made or furnished;

             (3) The Borrower shall fail to comply with any of the covenants
      contained in Articles 5, 6 and 7 provided, however, the Borrower shall

      contained in Section 5.8;

             (4) The Borrower or any Guarantor shall fail to perform or observe

      otherwise), (B) fail to perform or observe any term, covenant, or
      condition on its part to be performed or observed under any agreement or
      instrument relating to any such indebtedness, when required to be
      performed or observed (including any applicable grace periods), if the
      effect of such failure to perform or observe is to accelerate, or to
      permit the acceleration after the giving of notice or passage of time, or
      both, of the maturity of such indebtedness, whether or not such failure to
      perform or observe shall be waived by the holder of such indebtedness; or
      any such indebtedness shall be declared to be due and payable, or required
      to be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment),
      prior to the stated maturity thereof, or (C) be in default under any other
      indebtedness of the Borrower or such Guarantor to the Agent or any Lender;
      or any other event or condition shall occur or exist if the effect of such
      other event or condition is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration
      after the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, of the maturity of
      such indebtedness, whether or not the occurrence of such other event or
      condition shall be waived by the holder of such indebtedness, provided,
      however, that the event described on Schedule 9.1(5) shall not be
      considered an Event of Default;

             (6) The Borrower or any Guarantor (A) shall generally not, or shall

      for relief, or the appointment of a custodian, receiver, or trustee for
      all or any substantial part of its properties; or (F) shall suffer any

      cease to create a valid and perfected first priority security interest (or
      such lesser priority security interest as may be specifically set forth
      therein) in and to the property purported to be subject to such Security
      Document or otherwise to be in full force and effect, or any Security
      Document shall be declared null and void, or the validity or
      enforceability thereof shall be contested by the Borrower, or the Borrower

                                   ARTICLE 10

                                   THE AGENT

      Section 10.1 Appointment.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender
hereby designates People's as Agent to act as specified herein and in the other
Loan Documents, including without limitation as collateral agent for the benefit
of the Lenders with regard to all collateral securing the Loans.  Each Lender
and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent to take such
action on their behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein
and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder
as are specifically delegated to or required of the Agent by the terms hereof
and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The
Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its respective
officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

      Section 10.2 Nature of Duties.  The Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and in the
other Loan Documents.  Neither the Agent, nor any of its officers, directors,
agents, employees or affiliates, shall be liable for any action taken or omitted
by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as determined in a final and non-appealable decision by a court of
competent jurisdiction).  The duties of the Agent shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature; the Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender;
and nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, expressed or implied,
is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Agent any
obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except as
expressly set forth herein or therein.

      Section 10.3 Lack of Reliance on the Agent.  Independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, each Lender, and the Issuing Lender, to the extent it
deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower and each
Guarantor in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the
taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Borrower and each Guarantor and, except
as expressly provided in

                                      -60-

<PAGE>
this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the Issuing Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times
thereafter.  The Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender or the Issuing
Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties
herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection
herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, perfection, collectability, priority or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (or with respect to the validity, priority
or perfection of any security interests purported to be created hereunder or
thereunder) or the financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor or be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of
any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or the financial condition of the Borrower or Guarantors or the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.

      Section 10.4 Certain Rights of the Agent.  If the Agent shall request
instructions from the Lenders with respect to any act or action (including
failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
the Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action
unless and until the Agent shall have received instructions from the Lenders;
and the Agent shall incur no liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action
whatsoever against the Agent as a result of such Agent acting or refraining from
acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the
instructions of the Lenders.

      Section 10.5 Reliance.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying upon, any note, writing, resolution, notice,
statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram,
radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by
any Person that the Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to
all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Loan Document and
its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by the
Agent.

      Section 10.6 Indemnification.  To the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and
indemnify the Agent, in proportion to their respective aggregate Commitments
(determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders and, if all Loans have been
repaid in full, as determined immediately before giving effect to such
repayment) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements
of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or
incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; provided that to the extent that the Agent is reimbursed by
the Borrower for amounts paid by the Lenders pursuant to this Section 10.6, the
Agent shall reimburse the Lenders for such amounts; provided further, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined
in a final and non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction).

<PAGE>

      Section 10.7 The Agent in its Individual Capacity.  With respect to its
obligation to make Loans, or issue or participate in Letters of Credit, under
this Agreement, People's shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a
"Lender" and may exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not
performing the duties specified herein; and the term "Lenders," shall, unless
the context clearly otherwise indicates, include People's in its individual
capacity.  People's may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, investment banking, trust or other business with,
or provide debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial
advisory services) to, the Borrower or any Affiliate (or any Person engaged in a
similar business with the Borrower or any Affiliate) as if it were not
performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from the Borrower or any Affiliate for services in connection with
this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Lenders.

      Section 10.8 Resignation.

      (a) The Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and
duties hereunder and/or under the other Loan Documents at any time by giving
fifteen (15) Business Days' prior written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower
(provided that no such notice shall be required to be given to the Borrower if a
Default or Event of Default of the type described in Section 9.1(6) exists with
respect to the Borrower).  Any such resignation by the Agent hereunder shall
also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Lender, in which case the
resigning Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit
hereunder and (y) shall maintain all of its rights as Issuing Lender with
respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it prior to the date of such
resignation.  Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a
successor Agent pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided
below.

      (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Agent, the Lenders shall
appoint a successor Agent who shall be a commercial bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower (it being understood and agreed that (i)
the Borrower's acceptance of a successor Agent pursuant to this paragraph (b)
shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) so long as a Default or Event of
Default exists at such time such successor Agent shall not be required to be
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and (iii) any Lender is deemed to be
acceptable to the Borrower).

      (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed within such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, the Agent, with the consent of the Borrower
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but shall not be
required at any time when a Default or Event of Default exists and is
continuing), shall then appoint a successor Agent who shall serve as Agent
hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a
successor Agent as provided above.

      (d) If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to clause (b) or (c)
above by the thirtieth (30) Business Day after the date such notice of
resignation was given by the Agent, the Agent's resignation shall become
effective and the Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Agent
hereunder and/or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above.

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

      (e) Upon a resignation of the Agent pursuant to this Section 10.8, the
Agent shall remain indemnified to the extent provided in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the provisions of this Article 10 shall continue in

or to such other address (and/or facsimile transmission number) as the Borrower
or the Agent, or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have specified in a
notice sent to the others in accordance with this Section 11.2.

      Section 11.3 No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part of the Agent or
any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy
under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver of such right, power,
or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or
remedy under any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.  The remedies
provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

      Section 11.4 Successors and Assigns.

      (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, however, that the Borrower shall not (by agreement, operation of law,
or otherwise) assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations,
under any of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party without the
prior written consent of the Agent and the Lenders, and any such assignment or
delegation made without such consent shall be null and void.  Each Lender may
sell participations in, or may, subject to Section 11.4(b), assign, all or any
part of any of the Loans and its rights and obligations hereunder to another
lender, in which event (a) in the case of an assignment, the assignee shall
have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided therein), the
same rights, benefits and obligations as it would have if it were a Lender
hereunder; and (b) in the case of a participation, the participant shall have no
rights under the Loan Documents.  The agreement executed by such Lender in favor
of the participant shall not give the participant the right to require such
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except action directly
relating to (i) the extension of a payment date with respect to any portion of
the principal of or interest on any amount outstanding hereunder allocated to
such participant or any fee payable to such participant, (ii) the reduction of
the principal amount outstanding hereunder or (iii) the reduction

                                      -64-

<PAGE>
of the rate of interest payable on such amount or any amount of fees payable
hereunder to a rate or amount below that which such participant is entitled to
receive under its agreement with such Lender.  A Lender may furnish any
information concerning the Borrower in the possession of such Lender from time
to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants); provided that such Lender shall, if requested by the Borrower,
require any such prospective assignee or such participant (prospective or
otherwise) to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such
information, except as required by applicable laws or regulatory or governmental
authorities.  Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights
under the Loan Documents including any portion of the Notes to any of the twelve
(12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act,
12 U.S.C.  Section 341.  No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release
such Lender from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

      (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together with
one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its Commitments
and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Commitments have terminated, its
outstanding Obligations) hereunder to (i)(A) its parent company and/or any
Affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its
parent company or (B) one or more other Lenders or (ii) in the case of any
Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, any other fund that invests in
bank loans and is managed by the same investment advisor of any Lender or by an
Affiliate of such investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a
portion equal to at least $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender
or assigning Lenders of such Commitments and related outstanding Obligations
hereunder (or, if the Commitments have terminated, its outstanding Obligations)
to an Eligible Transferee (treating any fund that invests in bank loans and any
other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed or advised by the same
investment advisor of such fund or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as
a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a party to
this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement (it being understood that any assignment pursuant to clause (y) above
by any Lender described in preceding clause (x)(ii) must meet the $1,000,000
minimum described above unless the respective assignment is of all the
Commitments and related outstanding Obligations held by such Lender and any
other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same investment
advisor of any Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor), provided
that (i) at such time, Schedule 2 shall be deemed modified to reflect the
Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of such new Lender and
of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the surrender of the relevant Notes (if any)
by the assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender's indemnifying the
Borrower for any lost Note pursuant to a customary indemnification agreement)
new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower's expense, to such new Lender and to
the assigning Lender upon the request of such new Lender or assigning Lender,
such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement (with
appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised
Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, (iii) the consent of
the Agent shall be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant to
clause (y) above or any such assignment of Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant
to clause (x) above (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (iv) the consent of the Issuing Lender shall be required in connection
with any such assignment of Revolving Loan Commitments (which consents shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (v) the Agent shall receive at the

                                      -65-

<PAGE>
time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment
of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500, and (vi) no such transfer or
assignment will be effective until recorded by the Agent on the Register
pursuant to Section 11.20.  To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this
Section 11.4(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments and outstanding Loans.  At
the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 11.4(b) to a Person which
is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended) for federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee
Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the Borrower
the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms.  To the extent that an
assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Commitments and related
outstanding Obligations would, at the time of such assignment, result in
increased costs greater than those being charged by the respective assigning
Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay
such increased costs (although the Borrower, in accordance with and pursuant to
the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other
increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the
date of the respective assignment).

      Section 11.5 Costs, Expenses, and Taxes; Indemnification.

      (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, filing, recording, and
administration of any of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Lenders with
respect thereto and with respect to advising the Lenders as to their rights and
responsibilities under any of the Loan Documents including without limitation,
ongoing advice following the effectiveness of this Agreement and all costs and
expenses, if any, in connection with the protection, collection and/or other
enforcement of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  In addition,
the Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes and fees payable or
determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery, filing, and
recording of any of the Loan Documents and the other documents to be delivered
under any of the Loan Documents, and agrees to hold and save the Agent and each
Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or failure to pay such taxes and fees.

      (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each Lender, any other holder of
the Notes and each of the present and future shareholders, partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents, counsel and successors and assigns of each of them
(collectively with the Agent and each Lender the "Lender Parties") from and
against any and all loss, cost, expense, claim, liability (including strict
liability) or asserted liability incurred from or out of the Loans, the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, or any of the documents or
instruments to be executed and delivered hereunder, or otherwise arising out of
the debtor/creditor relationship between them, the Agent and each Lender or the
other Lender Parties relating to the Loans, the exercise of any of the Agent's
and each Lender's rights under the Loan Documents, any litigation or proceeding
instituted or conducted by any Governmental Authority, any act or omission of
the Borrower

                                      -66-

<PAGE>
or otherwise, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the same arises
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any Lender.

      (c) Without limiting the generality of the preceding subparagraph (b), the
Borrower agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Lender
Parties from and against, and to reimburse the Lender Parties on demand with
respect to, any and all matters of any and every kind or character, known or
unknown, fixed or contingent, asserted against or incurred by Lender Parties at
any time and from time to time by reason of or arising out of any violation of
any Environmental Laws, the presence, disposal, escape, seepage, leakage,
spillage, discharge, emission, release or threatened release of any Contaminant
or any action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or threatened with
respect to any Contaminant (including, but not limited to, claims with respect
to wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property), in each case,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
and allocated costs of internal counsel incurred in connection with any such
investigation, litigation or other proceeding.

      (d) The obligations of the Borrower described in this Section 11.5 shall
survive the closing of the transactions described in this Agreement, including
the making of any and all Loans and the payment and satisfaction of the Notes.

      Section 11.6 Right of Setoff.  The Agent and each Lender are hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time without notice to the Borrower (any
such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower), to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Agent or such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all
of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents, irrespective of
whether or not Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or the
Notes or such other Loan Document and although such obligations may be
unmatured.  The Agent or such Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights
of the Agent and each Lender under this Section 11.6 are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff)
which the Agent or such Lender may have.  ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE THE
AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER
COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE LOANS, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.

      Section 11.7 Cross-Collateralization.  All Collateral which the Lenders
may at any time acquire from the Borrower or Guarantors or from any other source
in connection with the Obligations arising under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall constitute Collateral for each and every Obligation,
without apportionment or designation as to particular Obligations.  All
Obligations, however and whenever incurred shall be secured by all of the
Collateral, however and whenever acquired.  The Lenders shall have the right in
their sole discretion to

                                      -67-

<PAGE>
determine the order in which the Lenders' rights in or remedies against any
Collateral are to be exercised and which type of Collateral or which portions of
Collateral are to be proceeding against and the order of application of proceeds
of Collateral as against particular Obligations.

      Section 11.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

      (a) This Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of
Connecticut without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

      (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
Connecticut State or United States Federal court sitting in Connecticut over any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or
the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such Connecticut State or Federal court.  The Borrower irrevocably consents to
the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies of such process to the Borrower at its address specified in
Section 11.2.  The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  The Borrower
further waives any objection to venue in such state and any objection to an
action or proceeding in such State on the basis of forum non conveniens.  The
Borrower further agrees that any action or proceeding brought against the Agent
or any Lender shall be brought only in Connecticut State or United States
Federal courts sitting in Connecticut.

      (c) Nothing in this Section 11.8 shall affect the right of the Agent or
any Lender to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect
the right of the Agent or any Lender to bring any action or proceeding against
the Borrower or its property in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

      (d) To the extent that the Borrower has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether from
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such Person
hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents.

      (e) THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE TRANSACTIONS ARE
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND IT HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO NOTICE AND HEARING AS
MAY BE ALLOWED UNDER CHAPTER 903a OF THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES, AS
AMENDED, OR AS OTHERWISE ALLOWED BY ANY STATE OF FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO ANY
PREJUDGMENT REMEDY AND PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER, PROVIDED THE
COMPLAINT SETS FORTH A COPY OF THE WAIVER AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM IN TORT, CONTRACT
OR OTHERWISE AGAINST LENDERS' ATTORNEYS WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF SUCH ISSUANCE OF
A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER.  FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT
ALLOWED UNDER

                                      -68-

<PAGE>
APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES DEMAND, PRESENTMENT FOR PAYMENT, PROTEST,
NOTICE OF PROTEST, NOTICE OF DISHONOR, DILIGENCE IN COLLECTION, NOTICE OF
NONPAYMENT OF ANY NOTE AND ANY AND ALL NOTICES OF A LIKE NATURE.  THE BORROWER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT MAKES THIS WAIVER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT
DURESS, AND ONLY AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS ATTORNEYS.

      Section 11.9 Entire Agreement; Severability of Provisions.

      (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents collectively constitute
the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersede any and all
contemporaneous and prior agreements, representations, arrangements and
understandings (written or oral, express or implied) relating to the subject
matter hereof.

      (b) If any term or provision of any of the Loan Documents or the
application thereof to any circumstance shall, in any jurisdiction and to any
extent, be invalid or unenforceable, such term or provision shall be ineffective
as to such jurisdiction only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions thereof or the application of such term or provision to
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable.

      Section 11.10 Estoppel Certificates.  Within fifteen (15) days after the
Agent requests the Borrower to do so, the Borrower shall cause its chief
financial officer to duly execute and deliver to the Agent a statement
certifying (a) that this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents to
which the Borrower is a party are in full force and effect and have not been
modified except as described in said statement, (b) the date to which interest
on the Notes has been paid, (c) the unpaid principal balance of the Notes, (d)
whether to the Borrower's knowledge a Default or an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and if so, describing in reasonable detail each such
Default or such Event of Default of which it has knowledge, (e) whether to its
knowledge the Borrower has any defense, setoff, or counterclaim to the payment
or performance of any of its obligations in accordance with the respective terms
of this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents, as the case may be,
and, if so, describing each defense, setoff, or counterclaim of which it has
knowledge in reasonable detail (including where applicable the amount thereof),
and (f) as to any other matter reasonably requested by the Agent.

      Section 11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial and Consequential Damages.

      (a) THE BORROWER AND THE LENDERS EACH HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION (1) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT,
DOCUMENT, OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR (2) IN
ANY WAY

                                      -69-

<PAGE>
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR
ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT, OR
AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND THE BORROWER
AND THE LENDERS EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND
THE AGENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.11 WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH OF THEM TO THE WAIVER OF
ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  THE BORROWER AND THE LENDERS EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT MAKES THIS WAIVER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT DURESS, AND ONLY AFTER
EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER WITH ITS ATTORNEYS.

      (b) NONE OF THE AGENT, ANY LENDER, BORROWER, OR ANY AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
EITHER OF THEM SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE OTHERS FOR PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHER WRONG
RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT, ADMINISTRATION, OR COLLECTION OF THE OBLIGATIONS
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR THE ACTION OR INACTION OF ANY OF SUCH PERSONS UNDER ANY ONE OR
MORE HEREOF OR THEREOF.

      (c) IN THE EVENT THE AGENT SEEKS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ANY OR ALL OF THE
COLLATERAL BY COURT PROCESS OR OTHER METHOD AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW, BORROWER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY BOND AND ANY SURETY OR SECURITY RELATING THERETO REQUIRED
BY ANY STATUTE, COURT RULE OR OTHERWISE AS AN INCIDENT TO SUCH POSSESSION, AND
WAIVES ANY DEMAND FOR POSSESSION PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANY SUIT OR ACTION
TO RECOVER WITH RESPECT THERETO.  BORROWER FURTHER WAIVES THE BENEFIT OF ALL
VALUATION, APPRAISEMENT AND EXEMPTION LAWS.

      Section 11.12 Replacement of the Note.  Upon receipt by the Borrower of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft,
destruction, or mutilation of any Note, and (a) in the case of loss, theft, or
destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory and furnished without cost to
the Borrower (provided, if the holder of such Note is a Lender or a bank,
insurance company, or other institutional lender, its own unsecured agreement of
indemnity shall be satisfactory), or (b) in the case of mutilation, upon
surrender and cancellation thereof, the Borrower will execute and deliver in
lieu thereof a replacement Note of like tenor.

      Section 11.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All
representations, warranties, and covenants made by the Borrower in this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or other
writing delivered by it or on its behalf thereunder shall

                                      -70-

<PAGE>
be considered to have been relied upon by the Agent and each Lender and shall
survive the delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  All
statements in any such certificate or other writing shall constitute
representations and warranties of the Borrower hereunder.

      Section 11.14 Further Assurances.  The Borrower from time to time shall
execute and deliver to the Lenders such additional documents and will provide
such additional information as the Agent may reasonably require to carry out the
terms of this Agreement and to keep the Agent and each Lender informed of the
status and affairs of the Borrower.

      Section 11.15 Construction.  Each covenant contained in this Agreement
shall be construed (absent an express contrary provision therein) as being
independent of each other covenant contained herein, and compliance with any one
covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to
excuse compliance with any other covenant.

      Section 11.16 Captions.  Article and Section titles in the Loan Documents,
and any table of contents, are included for convenience only and do not define,
limit, or describe the scope of the provisions thereof.

      Section 11.17 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed and delivered
in any number of counterparts.  Each counterpart shall constitute an original,
but all counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

      Section 11.18 Maximum Rate of Interest.  All agreements between the
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender are hereby expressly limited so that in no
contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration or maturity
of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid to the Agent and each Lender for the use or the forbearance of
the indebtedness under the Loan Documents exceed the maximum permissible under
applicable law.  As used herein, the term "applicable law" shall mean the law in
effect as of the date hereof provided, however that in the event there is a
change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then
this Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by such new law as of its
effective date.  In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of
the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender in the execution, delivery and
acceptance of this Agreement and the Notes to contract in strict compliance with
the laws of the State of Connecticut from time to time in effect.  If, under or
from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any
of the Loan Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due,
shall involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable
law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the
limits of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Agent
or any Lender should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the
highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be
applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to
the payment of interest.  This provision shall control every other provision of
all agreements between the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender.

      Section 11.19 Domicile of Loans.  Each Lender may transfer and carry its
Loans at, to or for the account of any office, subsidiary or affiliate of such
Lender.  Notwithstanding anything

                                      -71-

<PAGE>
to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that a transfer of Loans
pursuant to this Section 11.19 would, at the time of such transfer, result in
increased costs under Section 2.8 or 2.9 from those being charged by the
respective Lender prior to such transfer, then the Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay such increased costs (although the Borrower shall be obligated
to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from
changes after the date of the respective transfer).

      Section 11.20 Register.  The Borrower hereby designates the Agent to serve
as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 11.20, to maintain a register
(the "Register") on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of
each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in
respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.  Failure to make
any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the
Borrower's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  With respect
to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to
the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments
shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register and prior
to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such
Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.  The registration of
assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be
recorded by the Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Agent of a
properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.4(b).  Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement to the Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment
or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the
assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such
Loans, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal
amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new
Lender at the request of any such Lender.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the
Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of
whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Agent in performing its duties under this Section 11.20 except to the extent
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this Section 11.21, each
Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable efforts not to disclose without
the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to its affiliates, employees,
auditors, advisors or counsel or to another Lender if such Lender or such
Lender's holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that any
such party should have access to such information, provided such Persons shall
be directed to keep such information confidential as provided in this Section
11.21) any information with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
which is now or in the future furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document which
information is, at the time of its disclosure, confidential and/or proprietary
and clearly identified as such in writing, provided, that any Lender may
disclose any such information (i) as has become generally available to the
public other than by virtue of a breach of this Section 11.21(a) by the
respective Lender, (ii) as may be required or appropriate in any report,
statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or Federal regulatory
body having or claiming to

                                      -72-

have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the
United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (iii) as may be required or
appropriate in respect of any summons or subpoena or in connection with any
litigation, (iv) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling
applicable to such Lender, (v) to the Agent, (vi) to any direct or indirect
contractual counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to any such
contractual counterparty's professional advisor), so long as such contractual
counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by the provisions
of this Section 11.21 and (vii) to any prospective or actual transferee or
participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any
of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by such Lender, provided
that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the confidentiality
provisions contained in this Section 11.21.

      (b) The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Lender may share
with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share with such Lender, any
information related to the Borrower or the Guarantors (including, without
limitation, any non-public customer information regarding the creditworthiness
of the Borrower and the Guarantors), provided, such Persons shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section 11.21 to the same extent as such Lender.
