         Section 2.1 Advances. Lender shall make Advances to Parent from time to
time,  at the sole  discretion  of the  Lender,  during the period from the date

aggregate  amount of the  Commitment.  Amounts  borrowed  and  repaid may not be
reborrowed.  This is not a revolving  loan facility.  Borrower  agrees to comply
with the following procedures in requesting Advances under this Section 2.1:

                  (a) Lender  shall not make any Advance  under the Secured Loan
         Facility if, after giving effect to such requested Advance,  the sum of
         the Advances  heretofore made under this Section 2.1 or otherwise would
         exceed the Commitment.

                                       2
<PAGE>

                  (b) Lender shall not be required to make any Advance under the
         Secured  Loan  Facility  so long as an Event of  Default  exists or any
         event exists that with the passage of time or the giving of notice,  or
         both, would constitute an Event of Default.

                  (c) Each request for an Advance  shall be made in a writing to
         Lender (or agent specified in writing by Lender,  on behalf of Lender),
         which  may be  transmitted  by fax or  E-mail  (each a "Draw  Request")
         specifying  the date of the requested  Advance and the amount  thereof,
         and shall be made by the Operations Committee of the Board of Directors
         of Borrower.

                  (d) Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
         Section 4.2, Lender, at Lender's sole discretion, may make Advances.

                  (e) Loan  proceeds  advanced by Lender  shall be  disbursed by
         bank wire transfer to a bank account designated by Parent unless Lender
         and Parent otherwise agree.

                  (f) Each Draw Request  shall be deemed to be a  representation
         by each Borrower,  jointly and severally,  that: (i) the conditions set
         forth in this  Section 2.1 have been met, and (ii) the  conditions  set
         forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, as applicable,  have been satisfied
         as of the time of the request.

         Section 2.2 Secured Note.  All  Advances,  if any, made by Lender under
this Article II shall be evidenced by the Secured Note held by Lender, and shall
be repayable with interest in accordance with the Secured Note. The principal of
the Secured  Note shall be payable (a) as provided  herein and on the earlier of
the Termination Date or acceleration by Lender or (b) with respect to prepayment
in connection with the Tax Refund, as required under Section 2.7 or acceleration
by Lender under  Section  7.2, and in each case shall bear  interest as provided
herein.

         Section 2.3  Obligations  Absolute.  The  obligations  of each Borrower
arising under this Agreement shall be absolute,  unconditional  and irrevocable,
and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under
all circumstances whatsoever.

         Section 2.4 Interest.  The principal of the Advances  outstanding  from
time to time  during any month  shall bear  interest  (computed  on the basis of
actual days elapsed) at the rate per annum of the Prime Rate plus 4%;  provided,
however, that at no time shall such interest rate be computed on a Prime Rate of
less than Four and  Seventy-five  One Hundredths  percent  (4.75%) per annum and
provided further that such interest rate shall in no instance exceed the maximum
interest  rate, if any,  allowed by law. The Advances shall bear interest at the
Default Rate from and after a Default or an Event of Default.  Interest accruing
on the principal balance of the Advances  outstanding from time to time shall be
payable on the Termination Date or earlier prepayment in full.

         Section 2.5 Voluntary Prepayment; Termination of Agreement by Borrower.
Borrower may, in its discretion,  prepay the Advances in whole or in part at any
time or from  time to  time.  The  Commitment  automatically  shall  be  reduced
dollar-for-dollar  by the aggregate amount prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.5.
Parent,  on behalf of  Borrower,  may  terminate  this  Agreement at any time by


                                       3
<PAGE>

giving at least 30 days' prior written notice to Lender of Borrower's  intention
to  terminate  this  Agreement  and by  paying  in  full  the  amount  of all of
Borrowers' obligations under this Agreement and the Secured Note.

         Section 2.6 Use of Proceeds.  The  proceeds of all  Advances  hereunder
shall be used to provide  working  capital for  Borrower,  to pay for  operating
expenses  and for the  immediate  cash needs of  Borrower,  and to pay the fees,
costs and expenses of Lender.

         Section  2.7  Mandatory  Prepayment.  Immediately  upon  receipt of any
proceeds of the Tax Refund,  Borrower  will prepay the  principal  amount of the
Advances  by  delivering  to Lender  all  checks or other  evidences  of the Tax
Refund,  endorsed without  restriction to the order of Lender until such time as
the amount of the Tax Refund so applied equals the total of all Obligations then
outstanding.  Until  delivered to Lender,  all such checks or other evidences of
the Tax Refund  shall be held in trust by  Borrower  for and as the  property of
Lender.  To the extent  that the  aggregate  amount of the  proceeds  of the Tax
Refund exceeds the total of all Obligations then outstanding,  and provided that
there is no Default or Event of Default by Borrower  under this Agreement or the
Secured Note,  Lender will release its security  interest (granted under Article
III below) in the Tax Refund and will remit to Borrower  the full amount of such
excess. The Commitment  automatically shall be reduced  dollar-for-dollar by the
aggregate amount prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.7.

         Section 2.8 Payments.

         (a) Delivery of Payments.  All payments by Borrower of the  Obligations
shall be made in same day funds and  delivered  to Lender,  by wire  transfer to
such account or place as Lender may from time to time designate.

Borrower shall receive credit on the day of receipt for funds received by Lender
by 11:00 a.m. (Central time) on any business day. Funds received on any business
day after such time shall be deemed to have been paid on the next  business day.
Whenever  any  payment to be made  hereunder  shall be stated to be due on a day
that is not a business  day,  the  payment  shall be due on the next  succeeding
business day and such extension of time shall be included in the  computation of
the amount of interest and fees due hereunder.

         (b)  Invalid  Payments.  To the  extent  Borrower  makes a  payment  or
payments  to Lender,  and to the extent  any Tax Refund is  delivered  to Lender
pursuant  to  Section  2.7  hereof,  which  payments  or any  part  thereof  are
subsequently invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or preferential,  set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy  law, state or federal law,  common law or equitable cause (or to the
Internal Revenue Service,  in the case of a Tax Refund),  then, to the extent of
such payment or proceeds repaid,  the Obligations or part thereof intended to be
satisfied  shall be revived  and  continued  in full force and effect as if such
payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III

                               Security Interest

         representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date; and

                  (b) no event has occurred and is  continuing,  or would result
         from such Advance which constitutes a Default or an Event of Default.

valid and binding  obligations  of  Borrower,  enforceable  against  Borrower in

pending  or, to the  knowledge  of  Borrower,  threatened  against or  affecting
Borrower  or the  properties  of  Borrower  before  any  court  or  governmental

foreign,  which,  if  determined  adversely to  Borrower,  would have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties or operations of Borrower.

absolute  title to the right to  receive  the Tax  Refund  free and clear of all

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            Covenants and Agreements

         Section 6.1 Reporting Requirements. Parent will deliver, or cause to be
delivered,   to  Lender  such  financial  statements,   financial   information,
projections  and other  information  regarding  the  business of Borrower  (on a
consolidated  basis) as Lender may require  from time to time in  Lender's  sole
discretion.  In addition, to the extent any Borrower is obligated to furnish any
such  financial  statements  or  information  to any  other  provider  of credit
facilities or loans or floor-planning financing, Parent will cause copies of all
such information to be delivered simultaneously to Lender.

         Section 6.2 Authorization to File Financing  Statements.  Each Borrower
hereby  irrevocably  authorizes  Lender (or Lender's agent) at any time and from
time to time to file in any filing office in any jurisdiction  initial financing
statements and amendments thereto that describe or indicate the Tax Refund.

         Section 6.3  Indemnification.  Each  Borrower,  jointly and  severally,
agrees to indemnify,  defend and hold harmless the Lender,  and its  affiliates,
successors  and  assigns,  and  all  present  and  future  officers,  directors,
employees  and  agents of any of the  foregoing  (the  "Indemnitees"),  from and
against (i) any and all  liabilities,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  judgments,
suits, claims,  costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever  (including,
without  limitation,  the  reasonable  fees and  disbursements  of  counsel)  in
connection  with any  investigative,  administrative  or  judicial  proceedings,
whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto, which may be
imposed on,  incurred  by or asserted  against  such  Indemnitee,  in any manner
relating to or arising out of or in connection  with the making of the Advances,
the Tax Refund (including any governmental  disgorgement  attempt or proceeding)
or the use of intended  use of the proceeds of the  Advances  (the  "Indemnified
Liabilities"),  EVEN IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE LENDER'S  NEGLIGENCE  (OTHER
THAN GROSS  NEGLIGENCE)  CAUSED SUCH LOSS,  LIABILITY  OR EXPENSE IN WHOLE OR IN
PART. If any investigative,  judicial or administrative  proceeding arising from
any of the  foregoing is brought  against any  Indemnitee,  upon request of such
Indemnitee,   such  Borrower,   or  counsel  designated  by  such  Borrower  and
satisfactory  to the  Indemnitee,  will resist and defend such  action,  suit or
proceeding to the extent and in the manner as may be reasonably  directed by the
Indemnitee,  at such Borrower's sole cost and expense.  Each Indemnitee will use
its best  efforts  to  cooperate  in the  defense  of any such  action,  suit or
proceeding. If the foregoing undertaking to indemnity,  defend and hold harmless
may be held to be  unenforceable  because it violates any law or public  policy,
such Borrower shall  nevertheless  make the maximum  contribution to the payment
and  satisfaction  of each of the Indemnified  Liabilities  which is permissible
under  applicable  law. The  obligation of such Borrower  under this Section 6.3
shall  survive the  termination  of this  Agreement  and the  discharge  of such
Borrower" Obligations.

                  (a) Lender, may, by notice to Parent, declare the Secured Loan
         Facility  to  be  terminated,   whereupon  the  same  shall   forthwith
         terminate;

                  (b) Lender may, by notice to Parent,  declare to be  forthwith
         due and payable the entire unpaid  principal amount of the Secured Note
         then  outstanding,  all interest  accrued and unpaid  thereon,  and all
         amounts payable under this  Agreement,  whereupon the Secured Note, all
         such accrued interest and all such amounts and obligations shall become

         dishonor,  protest  or  further  notice of any  kind,  all of which are

         or under other applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  Miscellaneous

         Section 8.1 No Waiver;  Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay on the
part of Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents

any such right,  power or remedy preclude any other or further  exercise thereof
or the  exercise of any other right,  power or remedy under the Loan  Documents.
The remedies  provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of
any remedies provided by law.

         Section 8.2 Amendments, Etc. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any  provision  of any Loan  Document or consent to any  departure  by

signed by Lender, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific  instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or
demand on  Borrower in any case shall  entitle  Borrower to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
