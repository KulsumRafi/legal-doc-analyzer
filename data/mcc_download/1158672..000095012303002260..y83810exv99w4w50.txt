                                    of an owner with respect to securities or

                                    and in connection therewith to release the
                                    obligation on the covenant secured by such
                                    security and to exercise and enforce in any
                                    action, suit or proceeding at law or in

                                    any such security or guarantee;

                           (G)      to register any securities or other property
                                    held by it hereunder in its own name or in
                                    the name of a nominee with or without the
                                    addition of words indicating that the same
                                    are held in a fiduciary capacity; and to
                                    hold securities or other property in bearer
                                    form; provided, however, that the books and
                                    records of the Trustee shall at all times
                                    show that all such securities or other
                                    property are part of the Trust Fund;

                           (H)      to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver
                                    any and all deeds, leases, mortgages,
                                    conveyances, contracts, waivers, releases or
                                    other documents of transfer and any and all
                                    other instruments in writing necessary or
                                    proper for the accomplishment of any of the
                                    powers herein granted;

                           (I)      to hold any part of the Trust Fund
                                    uninvested if such action appears to be
                                    necessary or desirable in the administration
                                    of the Trust.

                  The exercise of any one or more of the foregoing powers or any
combination thereof from time to time shall not be deemed to exhaust the rights
of the Trustee to exercise such power or powers or combination of them
thereafter from time to time.

                  The Trust Fund shall be responsible for and the Trustee may
pay out of the Trust Fund (with or without any instructions from the Company),
all taxes, including Refundable Tax and financial obligations for any liability
imposed by a government or a governmental body which are levied or assessed and
are legally enforceable against the Trustee in respect of the Trust Fund or any
part thereof, or directly against the Trust Fund or any part thereof, and shall
withhold from payments out of the Trust Fund all taxes required by law or by the
administration thereof to be so withheld.

                  4.3      DISTRIBUTION PERIOD BORROWING - In the event there is
at any time insufficient assets in the Trust Fund to effect as and when due, any
periodic or lump sum payment of benefits then payable under the Plan in
accordance with the directions given to the Trustee under section 2.6 pending
receipt from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency of the Refundable Tax
applicable to the Plan, the Trustee may, forthwith, borrow funds on terms
acceptable to the Trustee acting reasonably from a lender acceptable to the
Trustee, which may for certainty, include the Royal Bank Financial Group up to
an amount of such Refundable Tax from any lender in an amount or amounts
sufficient to enable it to effect such payment, and the Company shall bear the
cost of such borrowing. The Company shall, if requested, reasonably co-operate
with the Trustee to the extent required to effect any such borrowing and, in
this regard the Company shall ensure the co-operation of its own bank. Following
a Confirmed Event of Default, no further borrowing shall occur.

                                       10

<PAGE>

                  4.4      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY - The Trustee shall not be
liable for any loss as a result of the making, retention, or sale of any
investment or reinvestment or loan made by it as herein provided nor for any
loss to or diminution of the Trust Fund except when such loss or diminution is
due to its own negligence, willful misconduct, lack of good faith, or breach of
this Agreement including the Standard of Care. The Company shall indemnify and
save harmless the Trustee on its own behalf and in trust for the Trust Fund and
the officers, directors and employees of the Trustee against any loss resulting
from a claim asserted by any person or persons where the Trustee has acted on
the direction of the Company, or has not acted in the absence of any such
direction.

                  4.5      COUNSEL, AUDITORS, ADVISORS AND AGENTS - The Trustee
may, after prior consultation with the Company prior to a Confirmed Event of
Default and after prior consultation with the Representative Participant after a
Confirmed Event of Default, employ such counsel (who may be counsel to the
Company), auditors, advisors, agents or other persons as the Trustee may
reasonably require for the purpose of discharging its duties hereunder and,
provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection of them, and in the
supervision of them, shall be protected in acting in good faith on the opinion
or advice of or information obtained from any counsel, auditors, advisors,
agents or other persons whether retained or employed by the Company or by the
Trustee, in relation to any matter arising in the administration of the Trust.

                  4.6      COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES - The Trustee shall be
entitled to such compensation as may from time to time be mutually agreed upon
in writing prior to a Confirmed Event of Default, by the Trustee and the Company
and, following a Confirmed Event of Default, by the Trustee and the
Representative Participant. Such compensation and all other disbursements made
and expenses incurred in the creation of the Trust shall be paid out of, and
shall constitute a charge against, the Trust Fund unless first paid by the
Company. All compensation, disbursements and expenses incurred in the management
and maintenance of the Trust Fund shall be paid out of, and shall constitute a
charge against, the Trust Fund unless first paid by the Company.

                  4.7      ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS - The Trustee shall keep and
maintain accurate and detailed accounts and records to record all transactions
with respect to its administration of the Trust Fund. The Company, or any duly
authorized representative, may at any time during usual business hours make an
inspection and audit of the books and records of the Trustee relating to the
Trust and an inspection of the assets held in the Trust Fund.

                  Within ninety (90) days following the end of the fiscal year
of the Trust Fund, or following the last day of such other accounting period as
may be agreed upon by the Company and the Trustee, and within ninety (90) days
following the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to
the Company a statement of account showing all transactions with respect to its
administration of the Trust Fund during the accounting period.

                  In the absence of specific written objections filed by the
Company with the Trustee within six (6) months after the Company's receipt of
such statements of account, the same shall be deemed to have been approved,
provided that such deemed approval shall not constitute an approval of any
breach by the Trustee of the Agreement, including the Standard of

                                       11

<PAGE>

Care; and in such case, or upon the written approval of the Company of any such
statements of account, the Trustee shall be released, relieved and discharged
with respect to all matters and things set forth therein as though the same had
been settled by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided,
however, that such release and discharge shall not apply to relieve the Trustee
from liability for any matter or thing which arises as a result of the Trustee's
own negligence, willful misconduct, lack of good faith or breach of this
Agreement, including the Standard of Care.

                  The Trustee may require the Company, the Participants, any
surviving spouses, the Participants' designated beneficiaries under the Plan or
any legal representative of such persons to submit to it any information, data,
reports or documents reasonably relevant to and suitable for the purposes of
administering the Trust Fund.

                  4.7A     NOTICE OBLIGATION - If an Event of Default or a
Confirmed Event of Default occurs, the Trustee shall forthwith give written
notice, as the case may be, to the Company in accordance with section 6.1, that
an Event of Default or Confirmed Event of Default has occurred and shall specify
the nature of the Event of Default or Confirmed Event of Default, as the case
may be.

                  4.8      INCOME TAX AND CERTAIN OTHER OBLIGATIONS - The
Trustee shall file, or cause to be filed, in prescribed form and within
prescribed time, such annual income tax returns and information returns on
behalf of the Trust Fund as are required by the Income Tax Act (Canada) or other
applicable federal or provincial legislation and shall furnish the Participants
and the Company with all requisite statements for income tax purposes. In
connection with the Trustee's obligations under the Income Tax Act (Canada) in
particular, the Trustee shall calculate the Refundable Tax of the Trust Fund at
the end of each taxation year and shall remit to the Receiver General out of the
Trust Fund the amount of tax, if any, payable by it for the year or claim a
refund of Refundable Tax owing to the Trust Fund, if applicable. The Trustee
shall further perform all required withholding and reporting under the Income
Tax Act (Canada), or other applicable federal or provincial legislation, in
respect of distributions under the Plan.

                  The Company shall file, or cause to be filed, any and all
returns and forms required to be filed by it with respect to the Plan by
applicable law. The Company shall forthwith establish its own retirement
compensation arrangement remittance account with the Canada Customs and Revenue
Agency. Thereafter, it shall remit to the Receiver General of Canada, within the
prescribed time, the Refundable Tax payable with respect to the initial
Contribution and each subsequent Contribution and shall inform the Trustee in
writing that such remittance has been made within the prescribed time.

                  4.9      REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPANT - If there has been a
payment to the Trustee in accordance with section 2.4(a), the Trustee shall, as
soon as is reasonably possible, provide to all Participants a notice requiring
them to appoint a person to represent them in matters relating to the Trust Fund
(hereinafter referred to as the "Representative Participant") who will be such
person as is elected by a majority of them in a manner satisfactory to the
Trustee within sixty (60) days of the issuance of such notice and failing that
will be the Participant who the Actuary advises the Trustee has at such time the
greatest present value of benefits payable hereunder determined on a solvency
basis. The Trustee will forthwith after learning of the identity of the

                                       12

<PAGE>

Representative Participant provide notice to all of the Participants as to the
identity of the Representative Participant who shall remain in such capacity
until the earlier of the date of (a) the termination of the Trust, (b) his or
her death, (c) the date the Trustee receives a written certification, statement,
letter or affidavit of a physician that the Representative Participant is
incapable of managing his or her affairs or (d) the election of his or her
replacement by a majority of the Participants in a manner satisfactory to the
Trustee. If the position of Representative Participant remains vacant for a
period of three (3) months following the appointment of the first (or any
subsequent) Representative Participant, the replacement Representative
Participant will be the Participant (other than a prior Representative
Participant) who the Actuary advises has at such time the greatest present value
of benefits payable hereunder determined on a solvency basis.

                  4.10     RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE - A Trustee at the
time acting hereunder may resign and be discharged from the Trust by filing
written notice with the Company or, following a payment to the Trustee in
accordance with section 2.4(a), the Representative Participant. Any Trustee
hereunder may be removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument
executed by the Company or, following an Event of Default, the Representative
Participant and filed with the Trustee. Such resignation or removal, as the case
may be, shall take effect ninety (90) days after the instrument of resignation
or removal has been filed as provided herein, unless the party with whom such
instrument is filed waives such requirement.

                  4.11     APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE - In case of the
resignation or removal of a Trustee or in case a vacancy shall arise for any
reason in the trusteeship of the Trust Fund, a successor Trustee, which shall be
a duly licensed and qualified trust company, or one or more individuals
(provided that no single Participant may be appointed) shall be appointed by an
instrument executed by the Company or, following payment to the Trustee in
accordance with section 2.4(a), the Representative Participant. Acceptance of
the appointment shall be evidenced in writing delivered by such Trustee to the
Company or the Representative Participant, as the case may be. Any successor
Trustee who accepts such appointment shall have the same powers and duties as
those conferred upon the Trustee hereunder and, upon acceptance of such
appointment by the successor Trustee, the Trustee shall assign, transfer and pay
over to such successor Trustee the funds and properties then constituting the
Trust Fund, together with any and all records, books and documents in the
Trustee's possession pertaining to the Trust Fund. Upon such transfer the
Trustee shall be discharged from any liability, obligations and responsibility
under the Trust Fund or in connection with the Plan in relation to matters
arising after the effective date of the appointment of the successor Trustee.
The Trustee is authorized, however, to reserve such compensation and other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the administration of the Trust
to the date of the resignation or removal of the Trustee and any balance of such
reserve remaining after the payment of such compensation and expenses shall be
paid over to the successor Trustee.

                  In the event the Company or the Representative Participant, as
the case may be, fails to appoint a successor Trustee within sixty (60) days of
the resignation or removal, the Trustee, at the expense of the Trust Fund, shall
have the right to seek appointment of a successor Trustee from a court of
competent jurisdiction.

a full refund of any accumulated Refundable Tax in accordance with the Income
Tax Act (Canada), the Company may terminate this Agreement and the Trust Fund
upon giving not less than thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice to the
Trustee provided that the Company has made arrangements satisfactory to a
majority of the Participants at the date such notice is given to replace this
Agreement and the Trust Fund by a new trust agreement and trust fund which
provide substantially the same benefits and rights to the Participants as under
this Agreement, and the notice contains (i) a certificate from the Actuary that
the new trust agreement and trust fund will provide substantially the same

                  (c)      thirdly, to pay each Participant, as directed by the
Company or, if there has been a payment to the Trustee in accordance with
section 2.4(a), as directed by the Actuary, an amount equal to the
Participant's entitlement under the Plan as at the date of the Confirmed Event
of Default subject to reduction, without adjustment for interest, by the
amounts, if any, paid to the Participant since the date of the Confirmed Event
of Default and termination of the Plan; and, if the Trust Fund is not sufficient
to pay the amount to which each Participant is entitled in accordance with the
foregoing, pro rata based on the amount of their entitlements; and

                  (d)      fourthly, to pay the balance, if any, to, or to the
