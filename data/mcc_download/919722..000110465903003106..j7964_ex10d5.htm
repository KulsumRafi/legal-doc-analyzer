things as may be necessary to make such sale of such Pledged Collateral valid

amount of damages which would be suffered by the Pledgees by reason of the
failure by the Pledgor to perform any of the covenants contained in this

any of such covenants, it shall pay, as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, an amount equal to the value of each Pledgee&#146;s Pledged Collateral on
the date such Pledgee demands compliance with this Section 9(b); provided,
however, that the payment of such amount shall not release the Pledgor from any
of its obligations under any provision of the Transaction Documents.</font></p>

impracticable to effect a public sale of all or any part of such Pledgee&#146;s
Pledged Collateral and that such Pledgee may, therefore, determine to make one
or more private sales of any such Pledged Collateral to a restricted group of
purchasers who will be obligated to agree, in the case of securities, among
other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment
and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.&#160; The Pledgor acknowledges that any such
private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than
the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed
to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the applicable
Pledgee shall have no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the
period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to register
such securities for public sale under the 1933 Act.&#160; The Pledgor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to
sell any such Pledged Collateral which has been (i) publicly advertised on a
bona fide basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in
the financial community of The City of New York (to the extent that such an
offer may be so advertised without prior registration under the 1933 Act) or
(ii) made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen bona
fide offerees shall be deemed to involve a &#147;public disposition&#148; for the
purposes of Section 9-610(c) of the UCC (or any successor or similar,
applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York,
notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a &#147;public offering&#148; under the
1933 Act, and that a Pledgee may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such
Pledged Collateral.</font></p>
