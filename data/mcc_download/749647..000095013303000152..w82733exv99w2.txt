fourth or fifth Year after the Launch Date, the amount equal to (A) the Net
Revenue for the 12-month period ending on the date of the Final Option Notice,
multiplied by (B) *;(4) provided, however, that in the event that the Option
Exercise Price calculated under paragraph (ii) or (iii) above shall equal an
amount less than $*, then the Option Exercise Price shall be deemed to be equal
to $*; provided further, however, that the Option Exercise Price as calculated
pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be subject to adjustment as
set forth in Section 8.03(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

accounting firm mutually acceptable to Celsion and BSC), of the calculation of
Net Revenue, and to examine the records and books of account of Celsion in
connection therewith. BSC shall bear the full cost and expense of any such

                    MATCHING RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF FIRST OFFER

        SECTION 9.01 Matching Right.

        If Celsion receives an unsolicited written offer in good faith from a
third party (the "Offeror") to enter into a New Product Transaction, Celsion
shall notify BSC of such offer and provide BSC with the right to accept such
offer on the same terms and conditions as are stated in the offer. Celsion's
notice to BSC shall set forth the name of the Offeror, the price and other terms
of the offer and any other information that is material to consideration of the
proposed New Product Transaction. BSC may elect to enter into the New Product
Transaction on the same terms and conditions as are set forth in the offer by
giving written notice to Celsion within 30 days after receiving notice from
Celsion. If BSC fails to respond, or notifies Celsion that it elects not to
match the terms of the third party offer, within such 30 day period, then
Celsion may proceed to consummate the proposed New Product Transaction with the
Offeror.

        SECTION 9.02 Right of First Offer.

        If Celsion desires to enter into a New Product Transaction, Celsion
shall provide BSC with the right to make a written offer in good faith for such
New Product Transaction. If BSC fails to make such an offer within 45 days after
receiving notice of the New Product Transaction from Celsion or, having made an
offer, fails to enter into such New Product Transaction within 45 days after
making such an offer, Celsion shall have the right to enter the New Product
Transaction with another Person; provided, however, that Celsion shall not enter
such New Product Transaction with such other Person if the terms and conditions
of such New Product Transaction are more favorable to such other Person than the
terms originally offered by BSC; provided further, however, that if the terms
and conditions of such New Product Transaction are more favorable to such other
Person than the terms most recently offered by BSC, Celsion shall provide BSC
with the right to enter into such New Product Transaction on such more favorable
terms and conditions by giving notice to Celsion within 15 Business Days after
receiving notice of such more favorable terms and conditions from Celsion.

        SECTION 9.03 Access to Information.

        Celsion shall, during the 30 day period specified in Section 9.01 and
each 45 day period specified in Section 9.02, (i) afford BSC and its
representatives access to those officers, directors, employees, agents,
accountants and counsel of Celsion who have any knowledge relating to the
relevant New Product Transaction and (ii) furnish to BSC and its representatives
such financial and operating data and other information and documentation
regarding the relevant New Product Transaction, in each case as BSC may from
time to time reasonably request in order for BSC to determine whether to
exercise its rights under Section 9.01 or 9.02, as the case may be.

        SECTION 9.04 Survival of Rights.

        BSC's rights under Sections 9.01 and 9.02 shall survive until the

                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS

        SECTION 10.01 Restriction on Sale of Celsion Shares.

        BSC acknowledges that the Celsion Shares shall be issued pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act, have not been registered
under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are
registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

        SECTION 10.02 Restrictive Legend.

        (a) Each certificate representing Celsion Shares shall be stamped or

                           AGREEMENT, DATED JANUARY 20, 2003, BETWEEN THE
                           CORPORATION AND BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION, ON
                           FILE AT THE OFFICES OF THE CORPORATION. THE
                           SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT
                           BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR
                           THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD
                           OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
                           EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT AND
                           APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR AN APPLICABLE
                           EXEMPTION TO THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH
                           ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

        (b) Celsion shall, at the request of BSC, remove from each certificate
evidencing Celsion Shares the legend described in Section 10.02(a) if in the
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Celsion the securities evidenced
thereby may be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act.

        SECTION 10.03 Demand Registration.

        (a) After receipt of a written request from BSC requesting that Celsion
effect a registration (a "Demand Registration") under the Securities Act
covering all or part of the Registrable Securities which specifies the intended
method or methods of disposition thereof, Celsion shall, as expeditiously as is
possible, but in any event no later than sixty (60) days (excluding any days
which occur during a permitted Blackout Period under Section 10.05 below) after
receipt of a written request for a Demand Registration, file with the SEC, and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective, a
registration statement (a "Demand Registration Statement") relating to all
shares of Registrable Securities which Celsion has been so requested to register
by BSC for sale, to the extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance
with the intended method or methods thereof, as aforesaid) of the Registrable
Securities so registered, provided, however, that the aggregate number of the
Registrable Securities requested to be registered (i) constitute at least 20% of
the Registrable Securities issued pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) include all
Registrable Securities which remain outstanding at such time.

        (b) Any Demand Registration Statement may be required by BSC to be in an
appropriate form under the Securities Act (a "Shelf Registration Statement")
relating to any or all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the
methods and distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule
415 under the Securities Act (the "Shelf Registration"). Any such demand to file
a Shelf Registration Statement shall require the use of two Demand for
Registration requests.

        (c) BSC shall be entitled to an aggregate of three registrations of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 10.03 (each, a "Demand for
Registration"); provided that a registration requested pursuant to this Section
10.03 shall not be deemed to have been effected for purposes of this Section
10.03(c) unless (i) it has been declared effective by the SEC, (ii) it has
remained effective for the period set forth in Section 10.06(a), and (iii) the

                                       28
<PAGE>

offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration is not subject
to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC (other
than any such stop order, injunction, or other requirement of the SEC prompted
by the act or omission of BSC).

        (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Celsion
shall not be required to prepare and file (i) more than two Demand Registration
Statements in any twelve-month period, or (ii) any Demand Registration Statement
within 90 days following the date of effectiveness of any other Registration
Statement.

        SECTION 10.04 Piggy-Back Registration.

        (a) If Celsion, proposes to file on its behalf and/or on behalf of any
holder of its securities (other than a holder of Registrable Securities) a
registration statement under the Securities Act on any form (other than a
registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form for securities
to be offered in a transaction of the type referred to in Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or to employees of Celsion pursuant to any employee benefit plan,
respectively) for the registration of Celsion Common Stock (a "Piggy-Back
Registration"), it will give written notice to BSC at least 20 days before the
initial filing with the SEC of such piggy-back registration statement (a
"Piggy-Back Registration Statement"), which notice shall set forth the intended
method of disposition of the securities proposed to be registered by Celsion.
The notice shall offer to include in such filing the aggregate number of shares
of Registrable Securities as BSC may request.

        (b) If BSC desires to have its Registrable Securities registered under
this Section 10.04, it shall advise Celsion in writing within ten days after the
date of receipt of such offer from Celsion, setting forth the amount of such
Registrable Securities for which registration is requested. Celsion shall
thereupon include in such filing the number or amount of Registrable Securities
for which registration is so requested, subject to paragraph (c) below, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect registration of such Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act.

        (c) If the Piggy-Back Registration relates to an underwritten public
offering and the managing underwriter of such proposed public offering advises
in writing that, in its opinion, the amount of Registrable Securities requested
to be included in the Piggy-Back Registration in addition to the securities
being registered by Celsion would be greater than the total number of securities
which can be sold in the offering without having a material adverse effect on
the distribution of such securities or otherwise having a material adverse
effect on the marketability thereof (the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then:

        (i)     in the event Celsion initiated the Piggy-Back Registration,
                Celsion shall include in such Piggy-Back Registration first, the
                securities Celsion proposes to register and second, the
                securities of all other selling security holders, including BSC,
                to be included in such Piggy-Back Registration in an amount
                which together with the securities Celsion proposes to register,
                shall not exceed the Maximum Number of Securities, such amount
                to be allocated among such selling security


                                       29
<PAGE>

                holders on a pro rata basis (based on the number of securities
                of Celsion held by each such selling security holder);

        (ii)    in the event any holder of securities of Celsion initiated the
                Piggy-Back Registration, Celsion shall include in such
                Piggy-Back Registration first, the securities such initiating
                security holder proposes to register, second, the securities of
                any other selling security holders, including BSC, in an amount
                which together with the securities the initiating security
                holder proposes to register, shall not exceed the Maximum Number
                of Securities, such amount to be allocated among such other
                selling security holders on a pro rata basis (based on the
                number of securities of Celsion held by each such selling
                security holder) and third, any securities Celsion proposes to
                register, in an amount which together with the securities the
                initiating security holder and the other selling security
                holders propose to register, shall not exceed the Maximum Number
                of Securities.

        (d) Celsion will not hereafter enter into any agreement, which is
inconsistent with the rights of priority provided in paragraph (c) above.

        (e) BSC's rights of registration under this Section 10.04 shall not
apply to any Piggy-Back Registration proposed to be filed during the first nine
months following the date hereof.

        SECTION 10.05 Blackout Periods.

        Celsion shall have the right to delay the filing or effectiveness of a
Registration Statement required pursuant to Sections 10.03 or 10.04 hereof
during no more than two periods aggregating to not more than 90 days in any
twelve-month period (a "Blackout Period") in the event that (i) Celsion would,
in accordance with the advice of its counsel, be required to disclose in the
prospectus information not otherwise then required by Law to be publicly
disclosed and (ii) in the judgment of Celsion's Board of Directors, there is a
reasonable likelihood that such disclosure, or any other action to be taken in
connection with the prospectus, would materially and adversely affect or
interfere with any financing, acquisition, merger, disposition of assets (not in
the ordinary course of business), corporate reorganization or other similar
transaction involving Celsion; provided, however, that Celsion shall delay
during such Blackout Period the filing or effectiveness of any Registration
Statement required pursuant to the registration rights of the holders of any
securities of Celsion. Celsion shall promptly give BSC written notice of such
determination containing a general statement of the reasons for such
postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay.

        SECTION 10.06 Registration Procedures.


                                       30
<PAGE>

        If Celsion is required by the provisions of Section 10.03 or 10.04 to
use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any of its
securities under the Securities Act, Celsion will, as expeditiously as possible:

        (a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect
to such securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement promptly to become and remain effective for a period of
time required for the disposition of such securities by the holders thereof but
not to exceed 30 days (except with respect to a Shelf Registration Statement
which shall remain effective for a period not to exceed 180 days); provided,
however, that before filing such registration statement or any amendments
thereto, Celsion shall furnish the representatives of BSC copies of all
documents proposed to be filed, which documents shall be subject to the review
of such representatives. Celsion shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable
best efforts to keep a Registration Statement effective during the applicable
period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in BSC not being
able to sell its Registrable Securities during that period, unless such action
is required under applicable Law;

        (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective and to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other
disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement until the
earlier of such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in a public
offering or the expiration of 30 days (except with respect to the Shelf
Registration Statement, for which such period shall be 90 days);

        (c) furnish to BSC such number of conformed copies of the applicable
Registration Statement and each such amendment and supplement thereto (including
in each case all exhibits), and of a summary prospectus or other prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents, as BSC may reasonably request;

        (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities or
blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States and Puerto Rico as
BSC shall reasonably request, and to keep such registration or qualification in
effect for so long as such Registration Statement remains in effect (provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
condition thereto to qualify to do business, subject itself to taxation in or to
file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction wherein it
would not but for the requirements of this paragraph (d) be obligated to do so;
and provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to qualify such
Registrable Securities in any jurisdiction in which the securities regulatory
authority requires that BSC submit any shares of its Registrable Securities to
the terms, provisions and restrictions of any escrow, lockup or similar
agreement(s) for consent to sell Registrable Securities in such jurisdiction
unless BSC agrees to do so), and do such other reasonable acts and things as may
be required of it to enable BSC to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdiction of the securities covered by such Registration Statement;


                                       31
<PAGE>

        (e) furnish, at the request of BSC, if the method of distribution is by
means of an underwriting, on the date that the shares of Registrable Securities
are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration, or if
such Registrable Securities are not being sold through underwriters, on the date
that the registration statement with respect to such shares of Registrable
Securities becomes effective, (i) a signed opinion, dated such date, of the
independent legal counsel representing Celsion for the purpose of such
registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and if such Registrable
Securities are not being sold through underwriters, then to BSC making such
request, as to such matters as such underwriters or BSC, as the case may be, may
reasonably request; and (ii) letters dated such date and the date the offering
is priced from the independent certified public accountants of Celsion,
addressed to the underwriters, if any, and if such Registrable Securities are
not being sold through underwriters, then to BSC and, if such accountants refuse
to deliver such letters to BSC, then to Celsion (i) stating that they are
independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the Securities
Act and that, in the opinion of such accountants, the financial statements and
other financial data of Celsion included in the Registration Statement or the
prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities
Act and (ii) covering such other financial matters (including information as to
the period ending not more than five Business Days prior to the date of such
letters) with respect to the registration in respect of which such letter is
being given as such underwriters or BSC, as the case may be, may reasonably
request and as would be customary in such a transaction;

        (f) enter into customary agreements (including if the method of
distribution is by means of an underwriting, an underwriting agreement in
customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order
to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

        (g) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make earnings statements
satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act generally
available to BSC no later than 45 days after the end of any twelve-month period
(or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any
fiscal quarter in which Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in an
underwritten public offering, or (ii) if not sold to underwriters in such an
offering, beginning with the first month of Celsion's first fiscal quarter
commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which
statements shall cover said twelve-month periods;

        (h) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on each securities exchange or quotation system on which
Celsion Common Stock is then listed;

        (i) give written notice to BSC:

        (i)     when such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has
                been filed with the SEC and when such Registration Statement or
                any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective;


                                       32
<PAGE>

        (ii)    of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such
                Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for
                additional information;

        (iii)   of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
                effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation
                of any proceedings for that purpose;

        (iv)    of the receipt by Celsion or its legal counsel of any
                notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification
                of Celsion Common Stock for sale in any jurisdiction or the
                initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose;
                and

        (v)     of the happening of any event that requires Celsion to make
                changes in such Registration Statement or the prospectus in
                order to make the statements therein not misleading (which
                notice shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use
                of the prospectus until the requisite changes have been made);

        (j) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance or obtain
the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement at the earliest possible time;

        (k) furnish to BSC, without charge, at least one copy of such
Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, and, if BSC so requests in writing, all
exhibits (including those, if any, incorporated by reference);

        (l) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 10.06(i)(v)
above, promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration
Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to BSC, the prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If Celsion notifies BSC in
accordance with Section 10.06(i)(v) above to suspend the use of the prospectus
until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then BSC shall
suspend use of such prospectus and use its reasonable best efforts to return to
Celsion all copies of such prospectus (at Celsion's expense) other than
permanent file copies then in BSC's possession, and the period of effectiveness
of such Registration Statement provided for above shall be extended by the
number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the
date BSC shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to
this Section 10.06(l);

        (m) make reasonably available for inspection by representatives of BSC,
any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration

all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of Celsion and cause Celsion's officers, directors and employees to
supply all relevant information reasonably requested by such representative or
any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the
registration; and

        (n) use reasonable best efforts to procure the cooperation of Celsion's
transfer agent in settling any offering or sale of Registrable Securities,
including with respect to the transfer of physical stock certificates into
book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably requested by BSC or
the underwriters.

        SECTION 10.07 Expenses.

        All expenses incurred in connection with each registration pursuant to
Sections 10.03 and 10.04, excluding underwriters' discounts and commissions, but
including without limitation all registration, filing and qualification fees,

expenses of any special audits or "comfort" letters required by or incident to
such performance and compliance), listing fees, messenger and delivery expenses,
all fees and expenses of complying with state securities or blue sky laws, fees

BSC shall bear and pay the (i) underwriting commissions and discounts applicable
to securities offered for its account in connection with any registrations,
filings and qualifications made pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) any fees and
expenses incurred in respect of counsel or other advisors to BSC.

        SECTION 10.08 Rule 144 Information.

        With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of the Registrable
Securities to the public without registration, at all times after 90 days after
any Registration Statement covering securities of Celsion shall have become
effective, Celsion agrees to use reasonable best efforts to:

        (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

        (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of Celsion under the Exchange Act; and

        (c) furnish to BSC forthwith upon request a written statement by Celsion
as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of such Rule 144 and of the
Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Celsion,
and such other reports and documents so filed by Celsion as BSC may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing BSC to
sell any Registrable Securities without registration.

        SECTION 10.09 Indemnification and Contribution.


                                       34
<PAGE>

        (a) Celsion shall indemnify and hold harmless BSC, each of its directors
and officers, each Person who participates in the offering of such Registrable
Securities, including underwriters (as defined in the Securities Act), and each
Person, if any, who controls BSC or a participating Person within the meaning of
the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which they may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or proceedings in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement on the
effective date thereof (including any prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act or any amendments or supplements thereto) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and shall reimburse BSC, BSC's directors and officers, such
participating or controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them (but not in excess of expenses incurred in respect of one
counsel for all of them unless there is an actual conflict of interest between
any indemnified parties, which indemnified parties may be represented by
separate counsel) in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that Celsion shall not be
liable to BSC, BSC's directors and officers, any participating or controlling
Person in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to
the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments
or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by
BSC, BSC's directors and officers, any participating or controlling Person. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of BSC, BSC's directors and officers, any participating or
controlling Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by BSC.

        (b) BSC shall indemnify and hold harmless Celsion, each of its directors
and officers, each Person, if any, who controls Celsion within the meaning of
the Securities Act, and each agent and any underwriter for Celsion (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which Celsion or any such director, officer,
controlling person, agent or underwriter may become subject, under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in such registration statement on the effective date thereof (including any
prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act or any amendments or
supplements thereto) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such registration
statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendments or supplements
thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
by or on behalf of BSC expressly for use in connection with such registration;
and BSC shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by


                                       35
<PAGE>

Celsion or any such director, officer, controlling person, agent or underwriter
(but not in excess of expenses incurred in respect of one counsel for all of
them unless there is an actual conflict of interest between any indemnified
parties, which indemnified parties may be represented by separate counsel) in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, however, that the liability of BSC hereunder
shall be limited to the aggregate proceeds received by BSC in connection with
any such registration under the Securities Act.

        (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10.09 from the
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party
and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or
indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other
fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. If the allocation provided in this paragraph (c) is
not permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall contribute based upon the
relevant benefits received by Celsion from the initial offering of the
securities on the one hand and the aggregate proceeds received by BSC from the
sale of securities on the other.

        The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 10.09(c) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from the other
party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

        (d) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees to give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party after the receipt by the
indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the
indemnified party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, that the failure so to notify the indemnified party
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to
the indemnifying party hereunder unless such failure is materially prejudicial
to the indemnifying party. If notice of commencement of any such action is given
to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, to assume the defense
of such action at its own expense,


                                       36
<PAGE>

with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party.
The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying
party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the
defense of such action, or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including
any impleaded parties) have been advised by such counsel that either (A)
representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party by the same
counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct or (B) there are one or more legal defenses available to it which are
substantially different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement
entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

        (e) The agreements contained in this Section 10.09 shall survive the
transfer of the Registrable Securities by BSC and sale of all the Registrable
Securities pursuant to any registration statement and shall remain in full force
and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of BSC, BSC's
directors or officers or any participating or controlling Person.

        SECTION 10.10 Limitations on Registration of Other Securities.

        From and after the date of this Agreement, Celsion shall not, without
the prior written consent of BSC, enter into any agreement with any holder or
prospective holder of any securities of Celsion giving such holder or
prospective holder any registration rights the terms of which are as or more
favorable taken as a whole than the registration rights granted to BSC hereunder
unless Celsion shall also give such rights to BSC hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

        SECTION 11.01 Confidentiality.

        During the term of this Agreement and for the period of five years
thereafter, the Receiving Party shall maintain Confidential Information in
confidence, and shall not disclose, divulge or otherwise communicate such
Confidential Information to others, or use it for any purpose, except pursuant
to, and in order to carry out, the terms and objectives of this Agreement. The
Receiving Party hereby shall exercise every reasonable precaution to prevent and
restrain the unauthorized disclosure of such Confidential Information by any of
its directors, officers, employees, consultants, subcontractors, or agents. Upon
termination of this Agreement, Celsion and BSC hereby shall return to the other,
upon demand, all Confidential Information in its possession or, upon demand, to
destroy such Confidential Information and provide a certificate to the other of
such destruction.


                                       37
<PAGE>

        SECTION 11.02 Release from Restrictions.

        The provisions of Section 11.01 shall not apply to any Confidential
Information disclosed hereunder that:

        (a) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by an independent,
unaffiliated Person rightfully in possession of the Confidential Information and
under no confidentiality or fiduciary obligation not to make disclosure;

        (b) becomes published or generally known to the public through no fault
or omission on the part of the Receiving Party;

        (c) is developed independently by the Receiving Party without access to
the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party;

        (d) is legally required to be disclosed to the FDA; or

        (e) a Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose; provided,
however, that the Receiving Party shall provide prompt written notice of such
requirement to the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing Party may seek a
protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with Section 11.01; and
provided further that in the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained or the Disclosing Party does not waive compliance with Section
11.01, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to furnish only that portion of
such Confidential Information that is legally required to be provided and the
Receiving Party shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances
that confidential treatment shall be accorded such information.

        SECTION 11.03 Public Announcements and Publications.

        No press release related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, or any other announcement or communication relating to the
subject matter of any Transaction Document shall be issued or made without the
consent of the other party, except any public disclosure which Celsion or BSC in
its good faith judgment believes is required by Law (in which case the party
making the disclosure will use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party prior to making any such disclosure).


                                  ARTICLE XII

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

Effect; and

        (d) no Action shall have been commenced or threatened against either
Celsion or BSC seeking to restrain or materially and adversely alter the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which, in the reasonable, good faith
determination of BSC, is likely to render it impossible or unlawful to
consummate such transactions. For the purposes of this Section 12.02(d) only,
the term "Action" shall not include any lawsuit primarily alleging Intellectual
Property infringement or misappropriation commenced by a third party against
Celsion.

        SECTION 12.03 Conditions to Obligations of BSC for Initial Closing.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

        SECTION 13.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

        The representations and warranties provided for in this Agreement shall
survive the Second Closing and remain in full force and effect until the second

representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04,
5.19, 6.01 and 6.05 shall survive indefinitely. If written notice of a claim has
been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable representations and warranties, then the relevant
representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until such claim
has been finally resolved.

        SECTION 13.02 Indemnification by Celsion.

        Celsion shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, BSC and each of
its subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
counsel, agents and representatives and each of their heirs, executors,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "BSC Indemnified Parties") against and
in respect of any and all Liabilities, losses, diminution in value, damages,
claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and


                                       40
<PAGE>

penalties (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and consultants'
fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (including, without
limitation, any Action brought or otherwise initiated by any of them)
(hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:

        (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Celsion contained in this Agreement (it being understood that such
representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
set forth therein); and

        (b) any breach by Celsion of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

        SECTION 13.03 Indemnification by BSC.

        BSC shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, Celsion and each of
its subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
counsel, agents and representatives and each of their heirs, executors,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Celsion Indemnified Parties") against
and in respect of any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

        (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of BSC
contained in this Agreement (it being understood that such representations and
warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or
qualifications as to "materiality" set forth therein); and

        (b) any breach by BSC of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

        SECTION 13.04 Enforcing Indemnification Claims.

        Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Article XIII (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying
Party") notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within
sixty (60) days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known,
and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the Section of
this Agreement in respect of which it elects to seek and recover
indemnification. The obligations and liabilities of the Indemnifying Party under
this Article XIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article XIII
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and be contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
notice of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article XIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure


                                       41
<PAGE>

and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this
Article XIII. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within five (5) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the
Indemnified Party in its reasonable discretion for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right
to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly,
in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or
under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by
the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, unless such settlement does not subject the Indemnified Party to any
monetary liability and includes a complete, unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such claim or demand.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as to release the Indemnified Party
from its obligations under any other provision contained in this Article XIII.

        SECTION 13.05 Adjustment to Subscription Amount.

        All amounts paid by Celsion or BSC, as the case may be, under this
Article XIII shall be treated as adjustments to the Subscription Amount for all
Tax purposes unless otherwise required by Law.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

                              TERM AND TERMINATION

        SECTION 14.01 Termination.

        This Agreement may be terminated:

        (a) by mutual written consent of Celsion and BSC;

                                       42
<PAGE>

        (b) by Celsion or BSC, if the other party (i) files in any court
pursuant to any Law in any country a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for
reorganization or for an arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee of such party or of its assets, (ii) proposes a written agreement of
composition for extension of its debts, (iii) is served with an involuntary
petition against it, filed in any insolvency proceeding, and such petition shall
not be dismissed within 60 days after filing thereof, (iv) is party to any
dissolution or liquidation, or (v) makes a general assignment for the benefit of
its creditors;

        (c) by Celsion or BSC upon 60 days written notice to the other party in
the event that the other party shall have materially breached any of its
obligations, representations or warranties hereunder and shall not have cured
such breach prior to the expiration of such 60-day period; or

        (d) by BSC, at any time if the Second Closing has not occurred by
November 1, 2003 or, following the Second Closing Date, at any time prior to the
Launch Date.

        SECTION 14.02 Effect of Termination.

        Termination of this Agreement shall not affect rights and obligations of
either party that may have accrued prior to the effective date of termination or
any obligation that by its nature or express terms survives termination. Without
limiting the foregoing, the provisions of Articles X, XI, XIII and XV shall
survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        SECTION 15.01 Expenses.

        Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring
such costs and expenses.

        SECTION 15.02 Notices.

        All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall be deemed to
have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in person, by an
internationally recognized overnight courier service, by telecopy or registered
or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective
parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as
shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 15.02):

        If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

        SECTION 15.05 Entire Agreement.

        This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents and the
Note, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

        SECTION 15.06 Further Action.

        Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver
such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions
of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        SECTION 15.07 Assignment.

        This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigned. Neither
party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party, provided that BSC may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without the approval of Celsion to an Affiliate of BSC. No assignment
by either party permitted hereunder shall relieve the applicable party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

        SECTION 15.08 Amendment.

        This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an
instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, Celsion and BSC or (b) by a
waiver in accordance with Section 15.11.

        SECTION 15.09 Governing Law and Venue.

        This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties unconditionally and irrevocably
agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the
State of Delaware and waive any objection with respect thereto, for the purpose
of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or


                                       45

relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and further
agree not to commence any such action, suit or proceeding except in any such
court.

        SECTION 15.10 Counterparts.

        This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

        SECTION 15.11 Waiver.

        Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party or
conditions to such party's obligations contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. All rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

        SECTION 15.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries.

        This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
the parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever.

        SECTION 15.13 Specific Performance.

        The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

        SECTION 15.14 Agreement.

        All Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed
part of this Agreement and incorporated herein, as if fully set forth herein.

LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
