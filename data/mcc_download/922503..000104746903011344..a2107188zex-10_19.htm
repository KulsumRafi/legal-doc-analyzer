(ii)&nbsp;the amount of the claim if then known. If the claim relates to an action, suit or proceeding filed by a third party against Claimant, notice shall be given by Claimant within fifteen
(15)&nbsp;days after written notice of the action, suit or proceeding was given to Claimant. In all other circumstances, notice shall be given by Claimant within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after
Claimant becomes aware of the facts giving rise to the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Claimant's failure to give Indemnitor timely notice shall not preclude Claimant from seeking
indemnification from Indemnitor if Claimant's failure has not materially prejudiced Indemnitor's ability to defend the claim or litigation. </FONT></P>

reasonably acceptable to Claimant, and the Claimant shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor, subject to reimbursement for
reasonable expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of a request by the Indemnitor. The Claimant shall have the right to participate in the defense of the claim at its own expense. If the
Indemnitor does not assume control of the defense of any third party claim, Claimant may, but shall have no obligation to, defend or settle such claim or litigation in such a manner as it deems
appropriate, and in such event Indemnitor shall be bound by the results obtained by the Claimant with respect to the claim (by default or otherwise) and shall promptly reimburse Claimant for the
