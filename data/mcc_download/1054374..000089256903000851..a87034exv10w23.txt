willing to do so on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         Borrower desires to secure all of the Obligations hereunder and under

                       THE LOANS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT

         2.01     The Commitment.

         (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Lender agrees to make Loans on the Closing Date in an aggregate
amount equal to $90,000,000. Borrower may make only one borrowing hereunder.
Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01 and subsequently repaid or prepaid may
not be reborrowed. Subject to the foregoing and the other terms and conditions
hereof, Borrower may Convert, Continue and prepay Loans as set forth herein
without premium or penalty.

                                       15

<PAGE>

         (b)      Loans made by Lender shall be evidenced by one or more loan
accounts or records maintained by Lender in the ordinary course of business.
Upon the request of Lender, the Loans may be evidenced by one or more notes,
instead of or in addition to loan accounts. Lender may attach schedules to its
note(s) and endorse thereon the date, amount and maturity of its Loans and
payments with respect thereto. Such notes, loan accounts and records shall be
prima facie evidence absent demonstrable error of the amount of such Loans and
payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower to pay any amount
owing with respect to the Loans.

         2.02     Conversions and Continuations of Loans.

         (a)      Borrower may irrevocably request a Conversion or Continuation
of Loans on any Business Day in a Minimum Amount therefor by delivering a
Request for Extension of Credit therefor to Lender not later than the Requisite
Time therefor. All Conversions and Continuations of Loans shall constitute Base
Rate Loans unless properly and timely otherwise designated in a Request for
Extension of Credit therefor as set forth in the first sentence of this
subsection (a).

         (b)      Lender shall promptly notify Borrower of the interest rate
applicable to any Offshore Rate Loan upon determination of same (or upon
Borrower's request with respect to Offshore Rate Loans which Borrower is
considering). Lender shall from time to time notify Borrower of any change in
its prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public
announcement of such change. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 4, all funds shall be credited in immediately available funds
to Borrower.

         (c)      Except as otherwise provided herein, an Offshore Rate Loan may
be Continued or Converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for such
Offshore Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, no
Loans may be Converted into or Continued as Offshore Rate Loans.

         2.03     Prepayments. Upon notice to Lender not later than the
Requisite Time therefor, Borrower may at any time and from time to time
voluntarily prepay Loans in part in the Minimum Amount therefor or in full
without premium or penalty. Any prepayment of an Offshore Rate Loan shall be
accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with the costs set forth
in Section 3.05.

         2.04     Principal and Interest.

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided hereunder, if not sooner paid,
Borrower agrees to pay the outstanding principal amount of each Loan on the
Maturity Date.

         (b)      Subject to subsection (c) below, and unless otherwise
specified herein, Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Loan (before and after default, before and after maturity, before and after
judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Laws) from the date borrowed until paid in full (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) on each Applicable Payment Date at a rate per annum
equal to the interest rate determined in accordance with the definition of such
type of Loan, plus, to the extent applicable in each case, the Applicable Amount
for such type of Loan.

                                       16

<PAGE>

         (c)      If any amount payable by Borrower under any Loan Document is
not paid when due (after taking into account any applicable grace, notice and
cure periods), it shall thereafter bear interest (after as well as before entry
of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) at a fluctuating interest
rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts
(including interest on past due interest) shall be payable upon demand.

         2.05     Fees.

         ARRANGEMENT FEE. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender an
upfront fee in an amount equal to $100,000. Such upfront fee is for the credit
facility committed by Lender under this Agreement and is fully earned on the
date paid.

         2.06     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Computation of interest on
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Lender's "prime rate" shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest
and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the
actual number of days elapsed which results in a higher yield to Lender than a
method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue on each Loan
for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any
portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid.

         2.07     MAKING PAYMENTS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by Borrower
shall be made to Lender at its Lending Office, and all payments by Lender shall
be made to Lender in the deposit account from time to time designated by
Borrower to Lender, in each case not later than the Requisite Time for such type
of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be deemed
received on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be made in
immediately available funds in lawful money of the United States of America. All
payments by Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.

         (b)      Subject to the definition of "Interest Period", if any payment
to be made by Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.

         2.08     FUNDING SOURCES. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
obligate Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner or to constitute a representation by Lender that it has obtained or will
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.09     APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS AFTER AN
EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, if requested by Lender (a) all payments received on account of the
Obligations, whether from Borrower or otherwise, shall be applied by Lender
against the Obligations and (b) all proceeds received by Lender in respect of
any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the

                                       17

<PAGE>

Collateral under any Collateral Document shall be applied by Lender against the
applicable Secured Obligations (as defined in such Collateral Document), in
each case in the following order of priority:

         (i)      to the payment of all documented out of pocket costs and
expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, all other documented out
of pocket expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Lender in
connection therewith, and all amounts for which Lender is entitled to
compensation, reimbursement and indemnification under any Loan Document and all
advances made by Lender thereunder for the account of the applicable Loan Party,
and to the payment of all documented out of pocket costs and expenses paid or
incurred by Lender in connection with the Loan Documents, all in accordance with
Sections 9.03 and 9.12 and the other terms of this Agreement and the Loan
Documents;

         (ii)     thereafter, to the payment of all other Obligations for the
benefit of Lender and any assignee or participant of Lender, as applicable; and

         (iii)    thereafter, to the payment to or upon the order of such Loan
Party or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court
of competent jurisdiction may direct;

provided, however, that a reasonable portion of such proceeds may, with respect
to fees, expenses and other obligations not yet payable, in the reasonable
discretion of Lender, be held by Lender as Collateral for, and/or (then or at
any time thereafter) applied in full or in part by Lender against the applicable
Secured Obligations.

                                  SECTION III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by Borrower to or for the account of
Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and
franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction
(or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which Lender is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If Borrower shall be
required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
under any Loan Document to Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), Lender receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such
payment, Borrower shall furnish to Lender the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof.

         (b)      In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any and all stamp, court
or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment

                                       18

<PAGE>

made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance,
enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)      If Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or
Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to
Lender, Borrower shall also pay to Lender, at the time interest is paid, such
additional amount that Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax
yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by
net income) Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been
imposed.

         (d)      Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender for the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by
any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by Lender, amounts
payable under Section 3.01(c) and any liability (including penalties, interest
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payment under this
subsection (d) shall be made within 30 Business Days after the date Lender makes
a demand therefor.

         (e)      Lender is a national banking association organized under the
laws of the United States of America and is a United States person as defined
under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

         (f)      If any lender becoming party to this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.04 is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States of America or any state or other political subdivision thereof
(for purposes of this Section 3.01(f), a "Non-US Lender"), such Non-US Lender
shall deliver to Borrower, on or prior to the Closing Date, and at such other
times as may be necessary in the determination of Borrower (in the reasonable
exercise of its discretion), two original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI
(or any successor forms) properly completed and duly executed by such Non-US
Lender, or, in the case of a Non-US Lender claiming exemption from United States
federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect
to payments of "portfolio interest," a form W-8BEN.

         Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial
delivery by such Non-US Lender of such forms, whenever a lapse in time or change
in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence so delivered
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Non-US Lender shall
promptly (i) deliver to Borrower two original copies of renewals, amendments or
additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such
Non-US Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption
required in order to confirm or establish that such Non-US Lender is not subject
to United States withholding tax with respect to payments to such Non-US Lender
under the Loan Documents, or (ii) notify Borrower of its inability to deliver
any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

         Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount to any
Non-US Lender under this Section 3.01 if such Non-US Lender shall have failed to
satisfy the requirements of this subsection (f); provided that if such Non-US
Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of this subsection (f) on the date
such Non-US Lender became a lender under this Agreement, nothing in this
subsection (f) shall relieve Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts
pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in any
applicable law, treaty

                                       19

<PAGE>

or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Non-US Lender is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such Non-US Lender is not subject to withholding as
described in this subsection (f).

         3.02     ILLEGALITY. If Lender determines that any Laws have made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Offshore Rate Loans,
or materially restricts the authority of Lender to purchase or sell, or to take
deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore Dollar market, or to determine
or charge interest rates based upon the Offshore Rate, then, on notice thereof
by Lender to Borrower, any obligation of Lender to make Offshore Rate Loans
shall be suspended until Lender notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
Borrower shall, upon demand from Lender, prepay or Convert all Offshore Rate
Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate
Loans. Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation
will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of
Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to Lender.

         3.03     INABILITY TO DETERMINE OFFSHORE RATE. If, in connection with
any Request for Extension of Credit involving any Offshore Rate Loan, Lender
determines that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the
applicable offshore dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period
of the requested Offshore Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Offshore Rate Loan,
or (c) such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to Lender of funding such Offshore Rate Loan, Lender shall promptly notify
Borrower. Thereafter, the obligation of Lender to make or maintain such Offshore
Rate Loan shall be suspended until Lender revokes such notice. Upon receipt of
such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for an Offshore Rate Loan
or, failing that, be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.

         3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a)      If Lender determines that any Law or change therein or in the
interpretation or administration thereof, in each case that becomes effective
after the date hereof:

                  (i)      subjects Lender to any Tax, duty, or other charge
         with respect to any Offshore Rate Loans or its obligation to make
         Offshore Rate Loans, or changes the basis on which taxes are imposed on
         any amounts payable to Lender under this Agreement in respect of any
         Offshore Rate Loans;

                  (ii)     shall impose or modify any reserve, special deposit,
         or similar requirement (other than the reserve requirement utilized in
         the determination of the Offshore Rate) relating to any extensions of
         credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or
         commitments of, Lender; or

                                       20

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    shall impose on Lender or on the offshore interbank
         market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any of such
         extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of
making, Converting into, Continuing, or maintaining any Offshore Rate Loans or
to reduce any sum received or receivable by Lender under this Agreement with
respect to any Offshore Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of
Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b)      If Lender determines that any change in or the interpretation
of any Laws have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of
Lender or compliance by Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation
controlling Lender as a consequence of Lender's obligations hereunder (taking
into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and Lender's
desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of Lender,
Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amounts as will compensate Lender
for such reduction.

         3.05     BREAKFUNDING COSTS. Upon demand of Lender from time to time,
Borrower shall promptly compensate Lender for and hold Lender harmless from any
loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

         (a)      any Continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment of any
Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or

         (b)      any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, Continue or Convert any Loan other
than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by Lender in
connection with the foregoing.

         3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION. A
certificate of Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3 and setting
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be prima
facie evidence of the amount thereof absent demonstrable error. In determining
such amount, Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
For purposes of this Section 3, Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
Offshore Rate Loan at the Offshore Base Rate used in determining the Offshore
Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable
offshore interbank market, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan was in fact so
funded. Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to make, fund or
maintain Offshore Rate Loans through another lending office of Lender if (a) as
a result thereof the additional amounts that would otherwise be required to be
paid to Lender pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04 would be materially reduced,
and (b) as determined by Lender in its sole discretion, such action would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to Lender.

Credit on or prior to the Closing Date.

                                       23

<PAGE>

         4.02     CONDITIONS TO ALL REQUESTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT. In
addition to any applicable conditions precedent set forth elsewhere in this
Section 4 or in Section 2, the obligation of Lender to honor any Request for

have been satisfied on and as of the date of such Extension of Credit.

                                   SECTION V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that:

         5.01     EXISTENCE AND QUALIFICATION; POWER; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
Borrower is a corporation duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the state of its incorporation or organization, has
the power and authority and the legal right to own and operate its properties,
to lease the properties it operates and to conduct its business, is duly
qualified and in good standing under the Laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, and is in compliance with all Laws except to the
extent that lack of qualification or noncompliance does not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         5.02     SUBSIDIARIES. All of the Subsidiaries of Borrower as of the
Closing Date and their jurisdictions of organization are listed on Schedule 5.02
and Schedule 5.02 correctly sets forth, as of the Closing Date, the ownership
interest of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of
Borrower identified therein.

         5.03     POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Borrower has
the power and authority and the legal right to make, deliver and perform each
Loan Document, and Borrower has power and authority to borrow hereunder and has
taken all necessary action to authorize the borrowings on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party. No consent or authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in
respect of any Governmental Authority or any other person is required in
connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery,
performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by
Borrower, and constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower,

                                       24

<PAGE>

enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, subject
to the effect of Debtor Relief Laws, the effect of equitable principles
(whether applied in an action at law or a suit in equity), and the other
exceptions and qualifications set forth in the legal opinion furnished to
Lender pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v).

         5.04     NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery, and performance by
Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and compliance with the
provisions thereof have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part
of Borrower and do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with, or result in a
breach of, or require any consent under (i) any Organization Documents of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any applicable Laws, rules, or
regulations or any order, writ, injunction, or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator, or (iii) any Contractual Obligation of Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which any of them or any of their property is bound or
subject, (b) constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument, or (c)
except as contemplated hereby, result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any of the properties of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         5.05     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

         (a)      The Audited Financial Statements (i) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby,
except as otherwise expressly noted therein; (ii) fairly present the financial
condition of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their
results of operations for the period covered thereby in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise
expressly noted therein; and (iii) show all material indebtedness and other
liabilities, direct or contingent, of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the
date thereof, including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and
Indebtedness in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period
covered thereby.

         (b)      Since December 31, 2001, there has been no event or
circumstance which has a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.06     LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in Borrower's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on or prior to December 31, 2001, no
litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before an arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower after due and
diligent investigation, threatened by or against Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of their properties or revenues which is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.07     NO DEFAULT. Neither Borrower nor any its Subsidiaries are in
default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation which has a Material
Adverse Effect, and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or will result from the consummation of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, or the making of the Extensions of Credit hereunder.

         5.08     OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Borrower and its Subsidiaries
have valid fee or leasehold interests in all real property which they use in
their respective businesses, and

                                       25

<PAGE>

Borrower and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all their other
property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien, except as permitted
in Section 7.02.

         5.09     TAXES. Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax
returns which are required to be filed, and have paid, or made provision for the
payment of, all taxes with respect to the periods, property or transactions
shown to be due on said returns, or pursuant to any assessment received by
Borrower or its respective Subsidiaries, except (a) such taxes, if any, as are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves have been established and maintained, and (b) immaterial
taxes; provided, however, that in each case no material item or portion of
property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is in jeopardy of being seized,
levied upon or forfeited.

         5.10     MARGIN REGULATIONS; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT.

         (a)      Borrower is not engaged, and will not engage, principally or
as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" "margin stock" within the respective
meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter
in effect. No part of the proceeds of any Extensions of Credit hereunder will be
used for "purchasing" or "carrying" "margin stock" as so defined or for any
purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of
Regulations T, U or X of such Board of Governors.

         (b)      Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a "holding
company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within
the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is
required to be registered as an "investment company" under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

         5.11     ERISA COMPLIANCE.

         (a)      Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state Laws. Each
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter
is currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of Borrower, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause the
loss of, such qualification. Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made all
required contributions to each Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and no
application for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan.

         (b)      There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan that has a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no
prohibited transaction or violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules with
respect to any Plan that has a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       26

<PAGE>

         (c)      (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability; (iii) neither
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur,
any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan (other
than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA); (iv) neither
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur,
any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice under
Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under Section 4201 or
4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan; and (v) neither Borrower nor
any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

         5.12     INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Borrower and its Subsidiaries own, or
possess the right to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents,
patent rights, franchises, licenses and other intangible assets that are used in
the conduct of their respective businesses as now operated except where failure
to own or possess the same has a Material Adverse Effect, and none of such
items, to the best knowledge of Borrower, conflicts with the valid trademark,
trade name, copyright, patent, patent right or intangible asset of any other
Person to the extent that such conflict has a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.13     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all Laws and applicable orders of any Governmental Authority
that are applicable to it, noncompliance with which has a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.14     ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Existing Environmental Laws and
claims alleging potential liability or responsibility for violation of any
Environmental Law on the respective businesses, operations and properties of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.15     INSURANCE. The properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not Affiliates
of Borrower, in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as
Borrower has determined in good faith to be necessary.

         5.16     DISCLOSURE. No statement, information, report, representation,
or warranty made by Borrower in any Loan Document or furnished to Lender in
connection with any Loan Document contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements herein
or therein not misleading, and Borrower has disclosed to Lender all facts and
circumstances which can reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.17     MATTERS RELATING TO COLLATERAL.

         (a)      The execution and delivery of the Collateral Documents by
Borrower, together with (i) the actions taken on or prior to the date hereof
pursuant to Sections 4.01(c) and (ii) the delivery to Lender of any Collateral
not delivered to Lender at the time of execution and delivery of the applicable
Collateral Document (all of which Collateral has been so delivered) are
effective to create in favor of Lender, as security for the Secured Obligations
(as defined in the applicable Collateral Document in respect of any Collateral),
a valid and perfected First Priority

                                       27

<PAGE>

Lien on all of the Collateral, and all filings and other actions necessary or
desirable to perfect and maintain the perfection and First Priority Lien status
of such Liens have been duly made or taken and remain in full force and effect,
other than the filing of any UCC financing statements delivered to Lender for
filing (but not yet filed) and the periodic filing of UCC continuation
statements in respect of UCC financing statements filed by or on behalf of
Lender.

         (b)      No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice
to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for
either (i) the pledge or grant by Borrower of the Liens purported to be created
in favor of Lender pursuant to any of the Collateral Documents or (ii) the
exercise by Lender of any rights or remedies in respect of any Collateral
(whether specifically granted or created pursuant to any of the Collateral
Documents or created or provided for by applicable law), except for filings or
recordings contemplated by Section 5.17(a) and except as may be required, in
connection with the disposition of any Collateral, by laws generally affecting
the offering and sale of securities.

         (c)      Except such as may have been filed in favor of Lender as
contemplated by Section 5.17(a) no effective UCC financing statement or other
instrument similar in effect covering all or any part of the Collateral is on
file in any filing or recording office.

         (d)      The pledge of the Collateral pursuant to the Collateral
Documents does not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

         (e)      All information supplied to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower
or any other Loan Party with respect to any of the Collateral (in each case
taken as a whole with respect to any particular Collateral) is accurate and
complete in all material respects.

                                   SECTION VI.
                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal year, and the related
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for such fiscal year, setting
forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the previous fiscal year,
all in reasonable detail, audited and accompanied by an opinion of an
independent certified public accountant of nationally recognized standing
reasonably acceptable to Lender, which opinion shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and shall not be subject to any qualifications or exceptions as to the
scope of the audit nor to any qualifications and exceptions not reasonably
acceptable to Lender; and

         (b)      as soon as available, but in any event within 50 days after
the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of
Borrower, a consolidated balance sheet of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at
the end of such fiscal quarter, and the related consolidated

                                       28

of Borrower's fiscal year then ended, setting forth in each case in comparative
form the figures for the corresponding fiscal quarter of the previous fiscal
year and the corresponding portion of the previous fiscal year, all in
reasonable detail and certified by a Responsible Officer of Borrower as fairly
presenting the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, subject only to normal
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.

         (c)      As to any information contained in materials furnished
pursuant to Section 6.02(b), Borrower shall not be separately required to
furnish such information under Section 6.01(a) or (b), but the foregoing shall
not be in derogation of the obligation of Borrower to furnish the information
and materials described in Section 6.01(a) and (b) at the times specified
therein.

         6.02     CERTIFICATES, NOTICES AND OTHER INFORMATION. Deliver to Lender

its Subsidiaries or on its income or profits or any of its property, except for
any such tax, assessment, charge, or levy permitted under Section 7.02(c) or
excepted from Section 5.09; provided, however, in the case of a charge or claim

         6.04     PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE. Preserve and maintain its
existence, licenses, permits, rights, franchises and privileges necessary or
desirable in the normal conduct of its business, except where failure to do so

of its properties and equipment necessary in the operation of its business in
good order and condition, subject to wear and tear in the ordinary course of
business, and not permit any waste of its properties, except where failure to do

amounts with such deductibles and against such risks as Borrower has determined
in good faith to be necessary.

         6.07     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

Adverse Effect.

         8.02     REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. Without limiting any other
rights or remedies of Lender provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, the Loan
Documents, or by applicable Law, or in equity, or otherwise:

         (a)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default other than an Event of Default described in Section 8.01(j), Lender may
declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest
accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan
Documents to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same shall become and
be immediately due and payable, without protest, presentment, notice of
dishonor, demand or notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by
Borrower.

         (b)      Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
Section 8.01(j), all obligations of Lender under the Loan Documents shall
automatically terminate without notice to or demand upon Borrower, which are
expressly waived by Borrower, and the unpaid principal of all Loans, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan
Documents shall be immediately due and payable, without protest, presentment,
notice of dishonor, demand or notice of any kind, all of which are expressly
waived by Borrower.

         (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, Lender, without notice to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan
Document) or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower
(except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan Document), may proceed
to protect, exercise and enforce its rights and remedies under the Loan
Documents against Borrower and such other rights and remedies as are provided by
Law or equity.

         (d)      The order and manner in which Lender's rights and remedies are
to be exercised shall be determined by Lender in its sole and absolute
discretion. Regardless of how Lender may treat payments for the purpose of its
own accounting, for the purpose of computing the Obligations hereunder, payments
shall be applied first, to costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs)
incurred by Lender, second, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the
Loans to and including the date of such application, third, to the payment of
the unpaid principal of the Loans, and fourth, to the payment of all other
amounts (including fees) then owing to Lender under the Loan Documents. No
application of payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent acceleration,
or continued acceleration, of amounts payable under the Loan Documents, or
prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights or remedies of Lender
hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity.

determined to have occurred upon telephonic confirmation with a representative
of Lender at GPO - Credit Services 6910, Mail Code: CA4-706-05-11, 1850 Gateway
Blvd, Concord, California 94520, (925) 675-8768. In no event shall a voicemail
message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

         (b)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties and Lender. Lender may also require that any such documents and
signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided,
however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the
effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

         (c)      Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet
and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications,
such as financial statements and other information as provided in Section 6.02,
and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may
not be used for any other purpose. No other legally-binding and/or
time-sensitive communication or Request for Extension of Credit may be sent by
electronic mail, facsimile or telephone without the consent of the intended
recipient in each instance; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Borrower may deliver Requests for Extension of Credit to Lender by
telephone and facsimile by the required time provided that any such telephonic
notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery by facsimile of a
Request for Extension of Credit to Lender on or before the proposed date of
Conversion or Continuation, as applicable.

         (d)      Reliance by Lender. Lender shall be entitled to rely and act
upon any notices (including telephonic and facsimile notices) purportedly given
by or on behalf of Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner
specified herein, were incomplete or were not

                                       39

<PAGE>

preceded or followed by any other form of notice or confirmation specified
herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from
any confirmation thereof. Borrower shall indemnify Lender, its Affiliates, and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of Borrower. All
telephonic notices to and other communications with Lender may be recorded by
Lender, and Borrower hereby consents to such recording.

         9.03     ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. Borrower agrees (a) to pay
or reimburse Lender for all reasonable and documented out of pocket and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment,
waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney Costs, (b) to pay or
reimburse Lender for all reasonable and documented out of pocket and expenses
incurred in connection with (i) creating or perfecting Liens in favor of Lender,
and (ii) the custody or preservation of any of the Collateral, and (c) to pay or
reimburse Lender for all documented out of pocket and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including
all such documented out of pocket and expenses incurred in connection with the
sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral,
during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during
any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law),
including all Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all
search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and
taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lender and
the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by
Lender. All amounts due under this Section 9.03 shall be payable within 45 days
after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

         9.04     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of Lender and Lender may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this
Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (e) of this Section (and any other attempted
assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (c) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                       40

<PAGE>

         (b)      Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees a portion not less than $20,000,000 of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans not less than
$20,000,000 at the time owing to it) pursuant to documentation acceptable to
Lender and the assignee; provided, however, Lender shall not assign,
individually or in the aggregate, more than $80,000,000 of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement. From and after the effective date specified in
such documentation, such Eligible Assignee shall be a party to this Agreement
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by Lender, have the rights and
obligations of Lender under this Agreement, and Lender shall, to the extent of
the interest so assigned, be released from its obligations under this Agreement.
Upon request, Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver new or
replacement notes to Lender and the assignee, and shall execute and deliver any
other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to give effect to such
assignment and to provide for the administration of this Agreement after giving
effect thereto. In the event that Lender so assigns any portion of the Loans,
Borrower and Lender agree that this Agreement shall be amended pursuant to a
mutually agreed upon amendment in order to provide that (i) Lender shall act as
agent for itself and all such assignees, (ii) amendments, modifications and
waivers of provisions of this Agreement (other than those that reduce the
principal amount of any Loan, postpone the scheduled final maturity date of any
Loan, postpone the date on which any interest or fees are payable, decrease the
interest rate borne by any Loan (other than any waiver of any increase in the
interest rate applicable to any of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) or the
amount of fees payable hereunder or increase the maximum duration of interest
periods, which shall not be effective without the written consent of all
lenders) shall not be effective without the written consent of lenders holding
51% or more of the Loans and (ii) Requests for Extension of Credit, payments and
Compliance Certificates shall be delivered to the agent.

         (c)      Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
Borrower, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or
Borrower or any of Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
"Participant") in all or a portion of Lender's rights and/or obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans); provided that (i)
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) Lender
shall remain solely responsible to Borrower for the performance of such
obligations and (iii) Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with
Lender in connection with Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement
and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that Lender
will not, without the consent of Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or
other modification that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of
money is scheduled to be made to such Participant, (ii) reduce the principal,
interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant (provided, however,
that Lender may, without the consent of Participant, (A) amend any financial
covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such
amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or to reduce any
fee payable hereunder and (B) waive the right to be paid interest at the Default
Rate), or (iii) release all or any material part of the Collateral. Subject to
subsection (d) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as
if it were Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b)

                                       41

<PAGE>

of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 as though it were Lender.

         (d)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Borrower's prior
written consent. A Participant that is not a "United States person" within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and/or a Non-US Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of Borrower, to provide to Lender such tax forms prescribed by the IRS
as are necessary or desirable to establish an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. withholding tax, including without limitation the materials described in
Section 3.01(f).

         (e)      Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under any note)
to secure obligations of Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for Lender as a party hereto.

         (f)      As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

         "Eligible Assignee" means (a) an Affiliate of Lender; (b) an Approved
Fund; and (c) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by
Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided
that no such approval shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

         "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will
be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial
loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.

         "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a)
Lender or (b) an Affiliate of Lender.

         9.05     SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of Lender or
any assignee or participant of Lender or any Affiliates thereof (each, a
"Proceeding Party") provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Proceeding Party is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to Borrower, any such notice
being waived by Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to proceed
directly, by right of set-off, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets
of Borrower which may be in the hands of such Proceeding Party (including all
general or special, time or demand, provisional or other deposits and other
indebtedness owing by such Proceeding Party to or for the credit or the account
of Borrower) and apply such assets against the Obligations, irrespective of
whether such Proceeding Party shall have made any demand therefor and although
such Obligations may be unmatured.

         9.06     NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by Lender to
exercise, and no delay by Lender in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege

                                       42

<PAGE>

under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law. Any
decision by Lender not to require payment of any interest (including Default
Interest), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document or to
calculate any amount payable by a particular method on any occasion shall in no
way limit or be deemed a waiver of Lender's right to require full payment
thereof, or to calculate an amount payable by another method that is not
inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion.

         9.07     USURY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any Loan Document, the interest and fees paid or agreed to be paid under the
Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If Lender shall receive
interest or a fee in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excessive
interest or fee shall be applied to the principal of the Outstanding Obligations
or, if it exceeds the unpaid principal, refunded to Borrower. In determining
whether the interest or a fee contracted for, charged, or received by Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, Lender may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations.

         9.08     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         9.09     INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents and any letter agreements referred to herein, comprises the complete
and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the subject matter hereof.
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those
of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control and
govern; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor
of Lender in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

         9.10     NATURE OF LENDER'S OBLIGATIONS. Nothing contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by Lender pursuant
hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make Lender a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or other entity with Borrower or any Affiliate of
Borrower.

         9.11     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Lender,
regardless of any investigation made by Lender or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default as
of the Closing

                                       43

<PAGE>

Date, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any
other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

         9.12     INDEMNIFICATION BY BORROWER. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless
Lender, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements
(including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any
time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any
way relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a) the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any
other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, (b) the commitment hereunder, any Loan or the use or
proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (c) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly
owned or operated by Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to Borrower, any Subsidiary or any
other Loan Party, or (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation
for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or
proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the
foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), in all cases, whether
or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the
Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall have any liability for any
indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith
(whether before or after the Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section
9.12 shall be payable within 45 days after demand therefor. The agreements in
this Section shall survive repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
Obligations.

         9.13     NONLIABILITY OF LENDER. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:

         (a)      Any inspections of any property of Borrower made by or through
Lender are for purposes of administration of the Loan Documents only, and
Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or not such inspections
are at the expense of Borrower);

         (b)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed, fulfilled or given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents, Lender
shall not be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality,
effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or
condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not constitute
a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by Lender;

         (c)      The relationship between Borrower and Lender created by this
Agreement is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrower and lender;
Lender shall not under any

                                       44

<PAGE>

circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a
fiduciary relationship with Borrower or its Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary
duty to Borrower or its Affiliates as a consequence of this Agreement; by
virtue of entering into this Agreement, Lender does not undertake or assume any
responsibility or duty to Borrower or its Affiliates to select, review,
inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrower or its Affiliates of
any matter in connection with their property or the operations of Borrower or
its Affiliates; Borrower and its Affiliates shall rely entirely upon their own
judgment with respect to such matters; and any review, inspection, supervision,
exercise of judgment or supply of information undertaken or assumed by Lender
in connection with this Agreement relative to such matters is solely for the
protection of Lender and neither Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to
rely thereon; and

         (d)      Lender shall not be responsible or liable to any Person for
any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or death to
Persons or damage to property caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of
Borrower and/or its Affiliates and Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds Lender
harmless from any such loss, damage, liability or claim.

         9.14     NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made for the
purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of
Borrower and Lender in connection with the Extensions of Credit, and is made for
the sole benefit of Borrower and Lender, and Lender's successors and assigns.
Except as provided in Sections 9.04 and 9.12, no other Person shall have any
rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof.

         9.15     SEVERABILITY. Any provision of the Loan Documents that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         9.16     CONFIDENTIALITY. Lender and each participant and assignee
shall use any confidential non-public information concerning Borrower and its
Subsidiaries that is furnished to it by or on behalf of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Loan Documents (collectively, "Confidential
Information") solely for the purpose of evaluating and providing products and
services to them and administering and enforcing the Loan Documents, and it will
hold the Confidential Information in confidence. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender may disclose Confidential Information (a) to its Affiliates or any of its
or its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees, auditors, counsel, advisors,
or representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") whom it determines need
to know such information for the purposes set forth in this Section, provided
that any such foregoing recipient of such Confidential Information agrees to
keep such Confidential Information confidential as specified herein; (b) to any
bank or financial institution or other entity to which Lender has assigned or
desires to assign an interest or participation in the Loan Documents or the
Obligations, provided that any such foregoing recipient of such Confidential
Information agrees to keep such Confidential Information confidential as
specified herein; (c) to any governmental agency or regulatory body having or
claiming to have authority to regulate or oversee any aspect of Lender's
business in connection with the exercise of such authority or claimed authority;
(d) to the extent necessary or appropriate to effect or preserve Lender's or any
of its Affiliates' security (if any) for any Obligation or to enforce any right
or remedy or in connection with any claims asserted by or

                                       45

<PAGE>

against Lender or any of its Representatives; and (e) pursuant to any subpoena
or any similar legal process; provided that, unless specifically prohibited by
applicable law or court order, Lender shall notify Borrower of any request by
any governmental or regulatory agency (other than any such request in
connection with any examination of the financial condition of Lender by such
regulatory agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to
disclosure of such information. For purposes hereof, the term "Confidential
Information" shall not include information that (x) is in Lender's possession
prior to its being provided by or on behalf of Borrower, provided that such
information is not known by Lender to be subject to another confidentiality
agreement with, or other legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality to,
a Borrower, (y) is or becomes publicly available (other than through a breach
hereof by Lender), or (z) becomes available to Lender on a nonconfidential
basis, provided that the source of such information was not known by Lender to
be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information.

         9.17     FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall, at
their expense and without expense to Lender, do, execute and deliver such
further acts and documents as Lender from time to time reasonably requires for
the assuring and confirming unto Lender of the rights hereby created or intended
now or hereafter so to be, or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the
performance of the terms of any Loan Document.

         9.18     HEADINGS. Section headings in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and are not part
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other purpose.

         9.19     TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents.

         9.20     Governing Law.
