unknown, and whether specifically mentioned or not, which may exist or might be claimed to exist at or prior to
the date of the retirement from Decker's employment (the "<B>Claims</B>"), as well as any future injuries, losses or

public accounting firm employed by the Company to conduct its 2002 audit). Decker and the Chief Executive Officer
("<B>CEO</B>") of the Company shall reasonably and timely meet and review the Individual Performance Goal for Decker's
IC Plan Payment in light of achievements attained and work performed by and under the supervision of Decker
during 2002, in order to determine the amount of the IC Plan Payment to be attributed to attainment of such
Individual Performance Goals.  The Company will withhold applicable federal, state and local income and/or
occupational taxes as well as Medicare taxes and other legally required deductions from the IC Plan Payment.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3><B>CHURCHILL DOWNS INCORPORATED
ANNOUNCES TRANSITION IN COMPANY'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER POST</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3><B>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Dec.
16, 2002) </B>&#150; Thomas H. Meeker, president and chief executive officer of
Churchill Downs Incorporated (&#147;CDI&#148;) (Nasdaq: CHDN), today announced
that Robert L. Decker, CDI&#146;s executive vice president and chief financial
officer and president of the Churchill Downs Simulcast Network
(&#147;CDSN&#148;), is leaving the Company to pursue other career opportunities.
Meeker also announced that Michael E. Miller, senior vice president of finance,
will be promoted to chief financial officer and Karl Schmitt Jr., chief
operating officer of CDSN, will be promoted to president of that Company
subsidiary. Miller and Schmitt will assume their new responsibilities at the
time of Decker&#146;s departure on Jan. 1, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We
have accelerated our succession plans for Mike Miller and Karl Schmitt to engage
these new roles in order to accommodate Bob&#146;s decision to take early
retirement, and we are confident in their abilities to help us grow the Company
and continue building long-term value for our shareholders,&#148; said Meeker. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decker
has served as CDI&#146;s executive vice president and chief financial officer
since 1997. CDI experienced exponential growth during Decker&#146;s tenure. The
Delavan, Wis., native managed the Company&#146;s acquisitions of Ellis Park,
Calder Race Course and Hollywood Park, as well as its merger with Arlington
International Racecourse &#150; now doing business as Arlington Park. Decker
guided the Company&#146;s listing on the Nasdaq National Market in 1997,
directed its secondary stock offering in 1999, and most recently, managed the
January 2002 spin-off of CDSN as a separate operating unit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decker
was to have shifted his focus exclusively to the growth of CDSN and the
Company&#146;s overall development efforts in early 2003. The transfer of
complete financial duties to Miller was also intended then to allow Decker more
time to explore potential growth opportunities for the Company and continue
implementing CDI&#146;s successful acquisition strategy in conjunction with
Meeker, whose employment contract with the Company was recently renewed. Decker
had helped plan this transition, but more recently decided that he saw new
professional horizons outside of CDI that he wanted to pursue. </FONT></P>

am very proud of what we have accomplished in the six years since I joined
CDI&#146;s executive management team,&#148; said Decker. &#147;We have increased
our market capitalization by 360 percent, completed strategic mergers and
acquisitions that have positively impacted our balance sheet, recruited an
impressive stable of racing properties to market under the CDSN banner and
established our brand as the most recognized and highly desired brand in the
racing industry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;My
time at CDI has been well spent, and I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to
work closely with Tom Meeker, the first-class team he has assembled and the
Company&#146;s board of directors,&#148; Decker added. &#147;Tom is a true
visionary in the horseracing industry. His sound judgment and take-charge
management style have been crucial to our Company as we executed a period of
intense growth and expansion into new markets. Many challenges lie ahead for our
Company and the industry as a whole, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>and Tom&#146;s leadership
is still needed for us to take full advantage of CDI&#146;s potential. With that
in mind, I have decided that my logical next step is to pursue another business
opportunity that will afford me continued professional growth and added
management responsibilities.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Bob
has been instrumental in leading this Company through a consolidation effort
that has helped cement CDI&#146;s status as the industry leader offering the
highest-quality racing content,&#148; said Meeker. &#147;He directed a focused,
disciplined acquisition strategy that grew the Company from two racetracks to
six and positioned it for future growth in areas such as alternative gaming and
domestic and international account wagering. His talents are well documented,
and we understand his desire to exercise those skills in a position that demands
a more balanced mix of operational and financial expertise. We are extremely
grateful for his efforts and accomplishments, and wish him the best in his
future endeavors.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Miller&#146;s new role as chief financial officer, he will oversee the
Company&#146;s finance, human resources and information technology departments.
He will report directly to Meeker, who will also assume oversight of the
Company&#146;s development initiatives. Prior to joining CDI as senior vice
president of finance in January 2000, Miller served as senior vice president,
chief financial officer and treasurer of Fender Musical Instruments in
Scottsdale, Ariz. The West Virginia native was previously a partner with the
certified public accounting firm of DeLoitte &amp; Touche in Dayton, Ohio. At
CDI, he has been responsible for accounting, tax, treasury, budgetary and
information technology issues for the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schmitt,
who joined Churchill Downs as director of publicity in 1987, became head of the
Company&#146;s new corporate communications department two years later and has
served the organization as senior vice president, communications since March
1998. He has participated in the negotiation of television contracts with NBC
and ESPN, led the Kentucky Derby media relations efforts, directed CDI&#146;s
Internet initiatives and provided counsel to senior management as the Company
grew from a single racetrack to a corporation with operations from coast to
coast. In January 2002, the Louisville native assumed his new role as chief
operating officer for CDSN. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeker expects a smooth transition as the two move into their new posts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Over
the past two years, Mike has demonstrated the acumen and leadership to guide
this Company financially in a competitive and challenging environment,&#148;
said Meeker. &#147;He spearheaded the integration of our recent acquisitions,
forged strong working relationships with each of our operating units as well as
our financial partners, led the effort to secure public support of our
&#145;Master Plan&#146; construction project to modernize Churchill Downs
racetrack and began the transition to become the Company&#146;s spokesperson to
the financial community. Mike has proven himself as a tremendous asset to CDI
and will serve the Company well as its chief financial officer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;In
addition, we&#146;re excited to have someone with Karl&#146;s experience and
industry knowledge leading our efforts to grow our simulcast unit,&#148; added
Meeker. &#147;Karl has directed our communications and new media initiatives
with great success, and his operational leadership of CDSN over the past year
gives us confidence that we can continue gaining market share in the simulcast
segment of our industry.&#148; </FONT></P>
