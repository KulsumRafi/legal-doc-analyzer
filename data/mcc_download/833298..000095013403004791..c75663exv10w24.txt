to the same extent as they apply to Schwarz, and the operations of the Affiliate
shall be deemed to be the operations of Schwarz and Schwarz shall account
therefor and be responsible for the performance of such Affiliate of all of its
obligations hereunder. In addition, Schwarz shall have the right to extend the
licenses granted pursuant to this Section 2 in whole or in part to Persons who
are not Affiliates of Schwarz with the prior written consent of CIMA, which

         7.2 Due Authority; No Breach. The execution, delivery and performance
by CIMA of this Agreement and each agreement or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, and the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by CIMA.
This Agreement is, and each agreement or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, when executed and delivered by CIMA in accordance with the provisions
hereof, will be (assuming the due execution and delivery hereof and thereof by
Schwarz) the legal, valid and binding obligation of CIMA, in each case
enforceable against CIMA in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, or similar laws from time to time in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by legal and equitable
limitations on the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies against CIMA. All persons who have executed this Agreement on behalf of
CIMA, or who will execute on behalf of CIMA any agreement or instrument
contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized to do so by all
necessary corporate action. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or any such other agreement or instrument by CIMA, nor the performance of the
obligations contemplated hereby or thereby, will (i) conflict with or result in
any violation of or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or
result in the acceleration of any obligation under, or constitute a default
under any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of CIMA or any
material contract or any other material obligation to which CIMA is a party or
to which it is subject or bound, or (ii) violate any judgment, order,
injunction, decree or award of any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or

pending or overtly threatened claim against CIMA asserting that any of the
Licensed Assets or CIMA Trademarks infringes or violates the rights of third
parties in the Territory or that Schwarz, by practicing under the Licensed
Assets and CIMA Trademarks in performing the Activities, would violate any of
the intellectual property rights of any third party in the Territory, and
nothing has come to the attention of CIMA which has, or reasonably should have,
led CIMA to believe that any of the Licensed Assets and CIMA Trademarks
infringes or violates the right of third parties in the Territory. CIMA has not
given any notice to any third parties asserting infringement by such third
parties upon any of the Licensed Assets and

contemplated hereby. There are no pending, and CIMA does not presently
contemplate bringing, any actions or suits relating to the Activities, the
Licensed Assets or the CIMA Trademarks against others.

authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any governmental
authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, or any agreement or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, by CIMA or the performance by CIMA of its obligations contemplated
hereby and thereby.

without limitation, using its reasonable efforts to make available to the other
such employees who may be helpful with respect to such investigation, claim,
litigation or other proceeding, provided that, for purposes of this provision,
reasonable efforts to make available any employee shall be deemed to mean
providing a party with reasonable access to any such employee at no cost for a
period of time not to exceed 24 hours (e.g., three 8-hour business days).

party relating to the Activities which would violate the terms of or conflict
with the rights granted to Schwarz pursuant to this Agreement.

         associated therewith. CIMA shall file, prosecute, and maintain all CIMA
         Patents so as to fully continue the benefits under the licenses granted
         to Schwarz hereunder. CIMA may, however, discontinue prosecuting and
         maintaining any CIMA Patent if (i) CIMA has a valid business reason to
         do so, and (ii) obtains the prior written approval of Schwarz, such
         approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         benefit of CIMA for purposes of building the longevity and extent of
         use of the CIMA Trademarks.

         prosecuting, and maintaining all trademarks it develops or owns for the
         Products (the "Schwarz Trademarks"), and Schwarz shall pay the costs
         associated therewith. All registrations, variations, logos, goodwill
         and other rights under or acquired through use of the Schwarz
         Trademarks shall accrue and belong to Schwarz CIMA shall have no rights
         to use the Schwarz Trademarks, including, without limitation, in
         connection with any product subsequently developed by CIMA. CIMA will
         not use in its business, in or outside of the Territory, any other mark
         or name which is similar to or nearly resembles the Schwarz Trademarks
         in use by Schwarz in a manner that is likely to cause deception or
         confusion. CIMA recognizes that Schwarz is the owner of all of the
         Schwarz Trademarks used in commerce to indicate the source of the
         Product and agrees that the Schwarz Trademarks shall remain vested in
         Schwarz both during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. CIMA
         shall not contest the validity of the Schwarz Trademarks or Schwarz's
         ownership of the Schwarz Trademarks. Use of the Schwarz Trademarks by
         Schwarz in conjunction with the manufacture, use, and sale of the
         Product and all goodwill related thereto shall

                                     - 22 -

         and extent of use of the Schwarz Trademarks.

                  (d) Schwarz and CIMA agree that, where applicable, all
         packaging of the Products shall identify (i) the number of the CIMA
         Patents and CIMA as the owner thereof and (ii) Schwarz as the owner of
         the Schwarz Trademarks.

                  (e) Any improvements to the CIMA Technology (whether or not
         patentable) shall be owned solely by CIMA.

                  (f) Any improvements to the Schwarz Technology (whether or not
         patentable) shall be owned solely by Schwarz

                  (g) Schwarz shall have full ownership rights to the Products
         with the exception of any improvements to the CIMA Technology as
         contemplated by Section 9.11(e).

                  (h) Any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding, Schwarz acknowledges that, for all purposes, CIMA is
         the owner of the CIMA Technology and CIMA acknowledges that, for all
         purposes, Schwarz is the owner of the Schwarz Technology.

         9.12 Infringement; Enforcement of Proprietary Rights.

                  (a) Infringement of Patent Rights. Each party shall promptly
         notify the other of any alleged infringement by third parties of any
         CIMA Patent and provide any information available to that party
         relating to such alleged infringement. CIMA shall have the
         responsibility to investigate such alleged infringement and act
         diligently, [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
         SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***], to end any
         infringement of such rights that materially affect Schwarz's rights
         pursuant to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, bringing
         suit against such third party infringer. In the event that CIMA does
         not bring suit against such third party infringer, Schwarz may, at its
         own expense, bring suit against such third party infringer on CIMA's
         behalf.

                  (b) Procedures. No settlement, consent judgment or other
         voluntary final disposition of any suit contemplated by Section 9.12(a)
         may be entered into without the consent of each party, which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any recovery of damages
         in any such suit shall be retained by the party bearing the costs of
         such suit. In the event of any infringement suit against a third party
         brought by either party pursuant to this Section 9.12, the party not
         bringing such suit shall cooperate in all respects, execute any
         documents reasonably necessary to permit the other party to prosecute
         such suit, and to the extent reasonable shall make available its
         employees and relevant records to provide evidence for such suit.

                  (c) Infringement of Third Party Rights. If, during the term of
         this Agreement, [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED

         SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] Schwarz's
         marketing or selling of the Product hereunder infringes on a third
         party patent based upon claims that dominate claims in the CIMA
         Patents, within [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED
         FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] after
         notice by Schwarz, CIMA shall use its reasonable best efforts to
         procure for Schwarz the right to exercise all rights licensed under
         this Agreement without any additional payment therefor by Schwarz

         9.13 Supply of Products. CIMA shall maintain sufficient capacity
throughout the term of this Agreement to meet the requirements of Schwarz for
the supply of Products hereunder.

         9.14 Liability Insurance. At and after each Launch, CIMA shall use its
best efforts to obtain and carry in full force and effect product liability
insurance in respect of the applicable Product in the amount of $1,000,000 per
occurrence and in the aggregate and policies of $10,000,000 of excess coverage
in the aggregate. At and after each Launch, Schwarz shall use its best efforts
to obtain and carry in full force and effect product liability insurance in
respect of the applicable Product in the amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence and
in the aggregate and policies of $10,000,000 of excess coverage in the
aggregate.

         9.15 Referral of Orders and Inquiries. CIMA shall refer all Persons
sending orders or making inquiries regarding the Products within the Territory
to Schwarz and shall promptly notify Schwarz of the name of each such Person and
the nature of the inquiry of such Person.

         9.16     Deemed Breach of Covenant. Neither CIMA nor Schwarz shall be
deemed to be in breach of any covenant contained in this Section 9 if such
party's deemed breach is the result of any action or inaction on the part of the
other party.

                                   SECTION 10

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         10.1 Indemnification.

            (a) CIMA shall indemnify, defend and hold Schwarz (and its
directors, officers, employees, and Affiliates) harmless from and against any
and all Damages incurred or suffered by Schwarz (and its directors, officers,
employees, and Affiliates) as a consequence of:

                  (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by CIMA
         in this Agreement or any agreement, instrument or document delivered by
         CIMA pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

                  (ii) any failure to perform duly and punctually any covenant,
         agreement or undertaking on the part of CIMA contained in this
         Agreement;

                                     - 24 -

<PAGE>

                 (iii) any act or omission of CIMA with respect to the operation
         of CIMA's business, or the handling, manufacturing or development of
         the Products by CIMA; or

                  (iv) the infringement of the Licensed Assets, the Patent or
         the Technology of any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or
         other intellectual property right of any person other than CIMA or
         Schwarz

         (b) Schwarz shall indemnify, defend and hold CIMA (and its directors,
officers, employees, and Affiliates) harmless from and against any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by CIMA (and its directors, officers, employees,
and Affiliates) as a consequence of:

                  (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
                  Schwarz in this Agreement or any agreement, instrument or
                  document delivered by Schwarz pursuant to the terms of this
                  Agreement;

                  (ii) any failure to perform duly and punctually any covenant,
                  agreement or undertaking on the part of Schwarz contained in
                  this Agreement; or

                  (iii) [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED
                  FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
                  COMMISSION.***] of Schwarz with respect to the operation of
                  Schwarz's business or the handling, marketing or sale of the
                  Products by Schwarz, including Schwarz's supply of API
                  hereunder.

         10.2 Notice and Opportunity To Defend. Promptly after receipt by a
party hereto of notice of any claim which could give rise to a right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1. such party (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice describing
the claim in reasonable detail. The failure of an Indemnified Party to give
notice in the manner provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this Section, except to the extent that such failure to
give notice materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, to
compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter
involving the asserted liability of the party seeking such indemnification. If
the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to compromise or defend any such asserted
liability, it shall promptly (and in any event not less than 10 days after
receipt of the Indemnified Party's original notice) notify the Indemnified Party
in writing of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise or
defense against any such asserted liability. All reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend the asserted
liability, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to compromise
or defend as herein provided, fails to admit its obligation to indemnify under
this Agreement with respect to the claim, or, if in the reasonable opinion of
the Indemnified Party, the claim could result in the Indemnified Party becoming
subject to injunctive relief or relief other than the payment of money damages
that could materially adversely affect the ongoing business of the Indemnified
Party in any manner, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option,
to pay, compromise or defend such asserted liability by its own counsel

                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>

and its reasonable costs and expenses shall be included as part of the
indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party may
settle or compromise any claim over the objection of the other; provided,
however, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party may
participate, at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted liability. If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents
within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.2, (i) the party
conducting the defense of a claim shall (A) keep the other party informed on a
reasonable and timely basis as to the status of the defense of such claim (but
only to the extent such other party is not participating jointly in the defense
of such claim), and (B) conduct the defense of such claim in a prudent manner,
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not cease to defend, settle or otherwise
dispose of any claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

         10.3 Indemnification Payment Obligation. No Indemnifying Party will
have any obligations under Sections 10.1(a) or 10.1(b) until the cumulative
aggregate amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party which
the Indemnifying Party is otherwise subject to under this Agreement exceeds
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] at which time the entire cumulative
aggregate amount of such Damages shall be covered. The provisions of this
Section 10.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any
Indemnifying Party under any other Section of this Agreement.

         10.4 Indemnification Payment Adjustments. The amount of any Damages for
which indemnification is provided under this Section 10 shall be reduced to take
account of any net tax benefit and shall be increased to take account of any net
tax detriment arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages or from
the receipt of any such indemnification payment and shall be reduced by the
insurance proceeds received and any other amount recovered, if any, by the
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages; provided, however, that an
Indemnified Party shall not be subject to an obligation to pursue an insurance
claim relating to any Damages for which indemnification is sought hereunder. If
any Indemnified Party shall have received any payment pursuant to this Section
10 with respect to any Damages and shall subsequently have received insurance
proceeds or other amounts with respect to such Damages, then such Indemnified
Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the difference (if
any) between (i) the sum of the amount of those insurance proceeds or other
amounts received and the amount of the payment by such Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to such Damages and (ii) the amount
necessary to fully and completely indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified
Party from and against such Damages; provided, however, in no event will such
Indemnified Party have any obligation pursuant to this sentence to pay to such
Indemnifying Party an amount greater than the amount of the payment by such
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 10 with respect to such Damages.

         10.5 Indemnification Payment. Upon the final determination of liability
and the amount of the indemnification payment under this Section 10, the
appropriate party shall pay to

                                     - 26 -

<PAGE>

the other, as the case may be, within 10 business days after such determination,
the amount of any claim for indemnification made hereunder.

         10.6 Survival. The provisions of Section 10 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. Each Indemnified Party's rights under Section 10
shall not be deemed to have been waived or otherwise affected by such
Indemnified Party's waiver of the breach of any representation, warranty,
agreement or covenant contained in or made pursuant this Agreement, unless such
waiver expressly and in writing also waives any or all of the Indemnified
Party's right under Section 10.

                                   SECTION 11

                                   TERMINATION

         11.1 Termination. The term of this Agreement shall begin upon the
Closing Date and, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, shall end
with respect to each Product upon the expiration of the last CIMA Patent
applicable to such Product to expire or, if later, the expiration of any other
patent resulting from the development process contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated as follows:

                  (a) Termination for Insolvency. If either Schwarz or CIMA (i)
         makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes
         insolvent; (ii) files an insolvency petition in bankruptcy; (iii)
         petitions for or acquiesces in the appointment of any receiver, trustee
         or similar officer to liquidate or conserve its business or any
         substantial part of its assets; (iv) commences under the laws of any
         jurisdiction any proceeding involving its insolvency, bankruptcy,
         reorganization, adjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or any
         other similar proceeding for the release of financially distressed
         debtors; or (v) becomes a party to any proceeding or action of the type
         described above in (iii) or (iv) and such proceeding or action remains
         undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than 60 days, then the
         other party may by written notice terminate this Agreement in its
         entirety with immediate effect.

                  (b) Termination for Default. Schwarz and CIMA each shall have
         the right to terminate this Agreement for default upon the other's
         failure to comply in any material respect with the terms and conditions
         of this Agreement. At least ninety (90) days prior to any such
         termination for default, the party seeking to so terminate shall give
         the other written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement
         in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.1(b), which notice
         shall set forth the default(s) which form the basis for such
         termination. If the defaulting party fails to correct such default(s)
         within ninety (90) days after receipt of notification, then such party
         immediately may terminate this Agreement. This Section 11.1(b) shall
         not be exclusive and shall not be in lieu of any other remedies
         available to a party hereto for any default hereunder on the part of
         the other party.

                  (c) Unilateral Termination by Schwarz Prior to Launch. Prior
         to the Launch of any Product, Schwarz will have the right to
         unilaterally terminate this Agreement

                                     - 27 -

<PAGE>

         either in its entirety or with respect to one or more specific Products
         at any time and in its sole discretion upon the delivery of written
         notice to CIMA. Any provision herein notwithstanding, in the event that
         Schwarz terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(c),
         Schwarz's sole obligation under this Agreement shall be to reimburse
         CIMA for the costs and expenses actually incurred by CIMA (i) in
         performing the development activities set forth on Schedule 4.1(b)
         hereto in respect of such terminated Product(s) prior to CIMA's receipt
         of such notice of termination and (ii) in connection with the orderly
         close out of such development activities; provided, however, that
         Schwarz's reimbursement obligations pursuant to this Section 11.1(c) in
         respect of any terminated Product(s) shall exclude the costs and
         expenses incurred by CIMA in connection with any Development Phase for
         which Schwarz has made a Development Fee Payment and shall in no event
         exceed the Development Fee Payment associated with the Development
         Phase on which CIMA is then working, as set forth on Schedule 4.1(b).

                  (d) Unilateral Termination by Schwarz After Launch. Following
         the Launch of any Product, Schwarz will have the right to unilaterally
         terminate this Agreement either in its entirety or with respect to one
         or more specific Products and in its sole discretion upon the delivery
         of written notice to CIMA. Termination of the Agreement either in its
         entirety or with respect to one or more specific Products will be
         effective with respect to such Product or Products one hundred eighty
         (180) days following such written notice to CIMA.

                  (e) Continuing Obligations. Termination of this Agreement for
         any reason shall not relieve the parties of any obligation accruing
         prior thereto with respect to any Product and any ongoing obligations
         hereunder with respect to the remaining Products and shall be without
         prejudice to the rights and remedies of either party with respect to
         any antecedent breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, no termination of this
         Agreement, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, shall serve to
         terminate the obligations of the parties hereto under Sections 5.8,
         9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9(a), 10, 11.1(c), 11.1(d), 11.1(e) and 12
         hereof, and such obligations shall survive any such termination.

                                   SECTION 12

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither CIMA nor Schwarz may
assign any of its rights, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
except that no prior written consent shall be required in the event that a third
party acquires substantially all of the assets or outstanding shares of, or
merges with, Schwarz or CIMA, as the case may be.

waived at any time by the party entitled to the benefit thereof by a written
instrument executed by such party. No delay on the part of CIMA or Schwarz in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of either CIMA or Schwarz of any
right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right,
power or privilege hereunder nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. The

rights or remedies which the parties hereto may otherwise have in equity.

         12.4 Survival of Representations. Each of the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement shall continue for the term of this Agreement

         12.5 Independent Contractors. The parties hereto are independent
contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to create
the relationship of partners, joint venturers, or of principal and agent,
franchisor and franchisee, or of any association or relationship between the
parties other than as expressly provided in this Agreement. Schwarz acknowledges
that it does not have, and Schwarz shall not make representations to any third
party, either directly or indirectly, indicating that Schwarz has any authority
to act for or on behalf of CIMA or to obligate CIMA in any way whatsoever. CIMA
acknowledges that it does not have, and it shall not make any representations to
any third party, either directly or indirectly, indicating that it has any
authority to act for or on behalf of Schwarz or to obligate Schwarz in any way
whatsoever.

         12.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements including, without limitation the Feasibility Agreement entered
by CIMA and Schwarz on November 30, 2001, or understandings of the parties
relating thereto.

         12.7 Amendment. This Agreement may be modified or amended only by
written agreement of the parties hereto.

         12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute a single instrument.

         12.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York excluding any choice of law
rules which may direct the application of the law of another state.

         12.10 Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement shall be determined and settled by arbitration
in New York, New York, pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration then in effect of
the American Arbitration Association. Any award rendered shall be final and
conclusive upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in a court
having competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration hereunder shall be (i) submitted
to an arbitration tribunal comprised of three (3) independent members

Schwarz, one of whom shall be selected by CIMA, and one of whom shall be
selected by the other two arbitrators; (ii) allow for the parties to request
discovery pursuant to the rules then in effect under the Federal Rules of Civil

both parties agree to continue performing their respective obligations under
this Agreement while the dispute is being resolved. Arbitration shall not
prevent any party from seeking injunctive relief where such remedy is an
appropriate form of remedy under the circumstances.

         12.11 Captions. All section titles or captions contained in this
Agreement, in any Schedule referred to herein or in any Exhibit annexed hereto,

Agreement and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

obligation in any Person not a party or not affiliated with a party to this
Agreement.

         12.13 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found or
declared to be invalid or unenforceable by any court or other competent

any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall thereafter continue in full
force and effect.

granting the requested consent would have an adverse impact on such party's
business activities.

ORDER.                                            BY:__________________________

<PAGE>
                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.   Definitions. (a) Buyer means Schwarz Pharma Manufacturing, Inc. (b) Seller
     means any person, firm, or corporation to whom this Purchase Order is
     directed.

2.   Terms: This Purchase Order constitutes any order to buy goods, equipment,
     material, supplies, or services according to the description and other
     terms set forth on its face and reverse side. No additional or different
     terms offered by the Seller shall be or become part of this order, nor
     shall this order be modified without the express written approval of Buyer.

3.   Shipping Instructions: All shipments must contain packing lists giving
     descriptions of material, quantity and purchase order number. If shipment
     is not made F.O.B. destination, the original bill of lading must be
     furnished with invoices. Buyer's count will be accepted as final on all
     shipments not accompanied by packing lists.

4.   Risk of Loss: The risk of loss from any casualty to the goods regardless of
     the cause, shall be on Seller until the goods have been received, inspected
     and accepted by the company.

5.   Delays in Delivery: Time is of the essence. If Seller for any reason does
     not comply with the buyer's delivery schedule, Buyer in addition to
     remedies provided by law, at its option may either approve and revise
     delivery schedule or, may terminate the order without liability on account
     thereof.

6.   Warranty: Seller expressly warrants that all goods, equipment, material,
     supplies or services covered by this order will conform to the
     specification, drawings, samples or other description furnished or
     specified by the Buyer, shall be of good material and workmanship and free
     from defects.

7.   Rejections: If any of the goods, equipment, material or supplies are found
     within a reasonable time after delivery to the Buyer to be defective in
     material or workmanship or otherwise not in conformity with the
     requirements of the order, Buyer, in addition to any other rights which it
     may have under warranties or otherwise, shall have the right to reject and
     return such goods at Seller's expense, such goods not to be replaced
     without suitable written authorization from Buyer.

8.   Patent Infringements: Seller shall pay costs and damages finally awarded in
     any suit against the Buyer or its vendees to the extent based upon a
     finding that the design or construction of articles as furnished infringes
     a United States Patent (except infringement occurring as a result of
     incorporating a design or modification at the request of Buyer); provided
     the Buyer promptly notifies Seller of any charge of such infringement and
     the Seller is given the right at its expense to settle such charge and to
     defend or control the defense of any suit based upon such charge, this
     paragraph sets forth the Seller's exclusive liability with respect to
     patents.

9.   Compliance with Laws: Seller shall comply with all applicable State,
     Federal and local laws, rules and regulations.

10a. Termination: The Buyer may terminate work on this order for its own
     convenience in whole or in part by written or telegraphic notice at any
     time. In the event, any claim arising out of such termination shall be
     settled by negotiation on the basis of the Seller's costs and commitments
     properly incurred or made, with due allowance for salvage value.

10b. If the Seller ceases to conduct its operations in the normal course of
     business including liability to meet its obligations as they mature of if
     any proceeding under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws is brought by or
     against the Seller, a receiver for the Seller is appointed or applied for
     or an assignment for the benefit of Creditors is made by the Seller, Buyer
     may terminate order without liability except for the deliveries previously
     made or for goods covered by the order then completed and subsequently
     delivered in accordance with the terms of the order.

11.  Nondiscrimination in Employment. Seller will not discriminate against any
     employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex,
     age, or national origin.

12.  Non-Waiver. Any waiver of strict compliance with the provisions of this
     order shall not be deemed a waiver of the Buyer's rights to insist upon
     strict compliance thereafter.

13.  Subcontracting. In the event the Seller subcontracts all or any part of
     this order, Seller remains completely responsible for price, delivery and
     quality.

Attention:  Chief Executive Officer

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to the Master Development, License and Supply
Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 (as amended, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "License Agreement"), by and between CIMA LABS
INC., a Delaware corporation ("CIMA") and Schwarz Pharma, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Schwarz"). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this
letter agreement (this "Letter Agreement") shall have the meanings given them in
the License Agreement.

         For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned hereby agrees to modify
the License Agreement as follows:

         1. In order to (i) memorialize the final agreement of the parties
regarding the Milestone Payments applicable to Product #3 ([***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) and Product #2 ([***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***]) and (ii) replace certain of the Products, as contemplated by
Section 3.4 of the License Agreement,

(a) Schedule 3.1 of the License Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the
    Products numbered 5, 6 and 7 in the table therein with the following (the
    "Replacement Products") and by replacing the relevant portions of the table
    in Schedule 3.1 that relate to the Products numbered 5, 6 and 7 with the
    information set forth below:

           [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
          SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]

          Schwarz and CIMA hereby agree that each of the Replacement Products
shall be deemed to be a Product under and as defined in the License Agreement.

<PAGE>
(b) Schedule 4.1(b) of the License Agreement is hereby amended such that the
    table included in paragraph (a) therein shall be deleted in its entirety and
    replaced with the table set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

         2. Schwarz and CIMA further agree that, anything to the contrary herein
or in the License Agreement notwithstanding, with respect to Product #7
([***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) only, the date after which the
Development Phase relating to [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION
OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***], as
contemplated by paragraph (b) of Schedule 4.1(b) of the License Agreement, shall
be [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] after deadline therefor. In
addition, should CIMA determine, in its reasonable discretion, that a
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] is not suitable and a [***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] is required for the [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***], the [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] referred to in this
paragraph 2 shall be extended to [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION
OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***].

         3. Schwarz and CIMA further agree that, anything to the contrary herein
or in the License Agreement notwithstanding, Product #5 ([***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) will be developed to be packaged in bottles and
blisters; provided, however, that if, for technical or stability reasons,
bottles are not suitable, such Product may be developed to be packaged in
blisters only.

         4. Schwarz and CIMA further agree that, anything to the contrary herein
or in the License Agreement notwithstanding, with respect to Product # 6
([***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) only, CIMA will perform an initial
formulation feasibility study ([***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION
OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) and
provide a report its findings to Schwarz no later than [***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]. At the time of such report, should either party not
want to proceed with the development of such Product, Schwarz will pay CIMA
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]. If such Product is canceled, Schwarz
may replace Product #6 with a new


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
Product in accordance with the License Agreement. Any such replacement Product
will be assigned a Completion Date to be agreed upon by the parties.

         5. Section 12 of the License Agreement is hereby, mutatis mutandis,
incorporated by reference as though specifically set forth herein.

         6. This Letter Agreement is binding and enforceable against CIMA and
Schwarz notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the License Agreement,
and, in the event of a conflict between this Letter Agreement and the License
Agreement, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall control.

         7. Each of the undersigned hereby ratifies the License Agreement, as
modified by this License Agreement, and agrees that the License Agreement, as
modified hereby, shall continue in full force and effect.

         5. Anything to the contrary herein or in the License Agreement
notwithstanding, the parties agree that the development activities described on
the Development Schedule and the payments to be made by Schwarz in respect of
such development activities contemplate CIMA conducting up to an aggregate total
of [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] stability study pulls (the "Expected
Stability Work"). In the event that such development activities require more
than the Expected Stability Work, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
additional compensation to be paid to CIMA on a per-pull basis.

         6. Anything to the contrary in the License Agreement notwithstanding,
Schwarz and CIMA hereby agree that Schwarz will pay CIMA the sum of
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] promptly upon receipt of CIMA's invoice
therefore, which amount shall satisfy in full Schwarz's obligations to CIMA in
respect of CIMA's development efforts in connection with the pharmaceutical
product [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY

Agreement.

         5. In order to memorialize certain agreements of the parties regarding
modifications to Schwarz's obligations to supply API, the License Agreement is
hereby amended as follows:

(a) Section 1 of the License Agreement is amended by adding the following
    defined term thereto:

            "'Provide' shall have the meaning given in Section 3.2 hereof."

 (b) Section 3.2 of the License Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
     replaced with the following:

                           "3.2 Supply of API.

                                    (a) The parties shall be responsible
                           for Providing API as follows:

                                         (i) CIMA shall be responsible for
                                    Providing all API consisting of

                                    all API that is classified as a "controlled

                                    Enforcement Agency ("DEA API"); provided,
                                    however, that CIMA shall notify Schwarz, at
                                    least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any
                                    order, of the quantity of such API that CIMA
                                    proposes to order. If Schwarz notifies CIMA
                                    within such forty-eight (48) hour period
                                    that Schwarz disagrees with the amount of
                                    API that CIMA proposes to order, CIMA shall
                                    postpone such order until such time as the
                                    parties shall agree upon the appropriate
                                    amount of such API.

                                         (ii) Schwarz shall be responsible for
                                    Providing all API not required to be
                                    provided by CIMA pursuant to clause (i),
                                    above.

                                    (b) The parties shall each be responsible
                           for the costs of Providing API incurred by them;
                           provided, however, that within thirty (30) days from
                           CIMA invoice date therefor, Schwarz shall, except as
                           set forth in Section 3.2(e), below,

                                    which CIMA incurs in connection with
                                    Providing API in accordance with Section
                                    3.2(a)(i).

                                    (c) As used herein, "Provide" means that the
                           applicable party shall be responsible, in respect of
                           the API which it is responsible for Providing, for
                           ordering, receiving and testing such API, paying
                           supplier invoices therefor, releasing such API for
                           use, auditing suppliers thereof for cGMP compliance
                           and keeping Schwarz's Regulatory Affairs department
                           apprised of the status of the Drug Master Files in
                           respect of such API.

                                    (d) CIMA shall, promptly following the end
                           of each Quarter, furnish to Schwarz a written report
                           of the total amount of each type of API in CIMA's
                           inventory as of the final day of such Quarter, as
                           reflected on CIMA's books and records.

                                    (e) Schwarz agrees and acknowledges that it
                           shall be responsible to CIMA for the amounts
                           described in this Section 3.2 that CIMA incurs in
                           respect of any API that is used, lost, destroyed or
                           otherwise consumed in connection with the development
                           activities described on the Development Schedule. In
                           the event, however, that any API is lost, stolen,
                           destroyed, or otherwise consumed at CIMA's facilities
                           other than in connection with such development
                           activities ("Lost API"), CIMA agrees to (i) file and
                           pursue a claim for the value of such Lost API under
                           its applicable insurance policy and (ii) promptly
                           remit to Schwarz any proceeds received from its
                           insurers in respect of such Lost API."

(c) Section 12.3 of the License Agreement is amended by deleting the last
    sentence thereof and replacing the same with the following:

                           "Except as set forth in Section 3.2(e), the
indemnification provided in Section 10 shall be the sole remedy available for
any Damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement except for any
rights or remedies which the parties hereto may otherwise have in equity."

(d) Section 5.1(d) of the License Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
    replaced with the following:

                           Section 5.4, quantities of API sufficient for (i) for
                           CIMA to perform its obligations pursuant to Schedule

                           to Schwarz's then current raw materials
                           specifications. CIMA shall not be accountable for any
                           production or shipment delays due to lack of any API
                           that Schwarz is required to Provide pursuant to
                           Section 3.2."

         6. The parties hereby agree that, anything to the contrary in the
License Agreement notwithstanding, any Products that are contemplated in the
License Agreement as being packaged using "CIMA Standard" packaging and/or "CIMA
Standard" tablet size, may, at Schwarz's sole option, be packaged using child
resistant packaging ("CR Packaging") and/or utilize non-standard tablet size
tooling ("Off-Size Tooling"). In accordance with such agreement, in the event
that Schwarz elects to have any Products packaged in CR Packaging and/or utilize
Off-Size Tooling, the parties further agree as follows:

                  (a) CIMA shall be solely responsible for the development of CR
Packaging and/or Off-Size Tooling for each applicable Product in accordance with
specifications to be provided by Schwarz; provided, however, that Schwarz shall
reimburse CIMA, on a Quarterly basis and, within thirty (30) days after receipt
of invoices from CIMA, for all costs incurred by CIMA in connection with any
design and testing activities in respect of the CR Packaging that are conducted
by third parties and which are approved in advance by Schwarz.

(b) CIMA shall be responsible, subject to Schwarz's approval, not to
    unreasonably be withheld, for the purchase of any equipment needed for CR
    Packaging and Off-Size Tooling that is not then owned or leased by CIMA. The
    aggregate purchase price (the "Equipment Costs") of the equipment to be
    purchased by CIMA in order to perform its obligations under this paragraph 6
    (the "Optional Equipment") [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION

    Such Equipment Costs shall be included, [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

    each Product in accordance with Schedule 5.3 of the License Agreement;
    provided, however, that the portion of the Equipment Cost allocable to
    Schwarz during any Year shall be determined [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

    COMMISSION.***] for the Product(s) requiring CR Packaging or Off-Size
    Tooling, as applicable, in accordance with [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

         EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] for such Year and; provided further, that
         Schwarz shall not be responsible, during any Year, for any Equipment
         Costs to the extent that the Optional Equipment is used for products
         other than Products, determined [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
         PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
         COMMISSION.***] in accordance with [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
         REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
         EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] during such Year. In the event that Schwarz
         cancels all Products requiring CR Packaging or Off-Size Tooling in
         accordance with the terms of the License Agreement, within
         [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY
         WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] of the cancellation of
         the last such Product requiring such packaging, Schwarz shall pay to
         CIMA the amount of the Equipment Costs related to the CR Packaging or
         the Off-Size Tooling, as applicable, that have not theretofore been
         reimbursed by Schwarz or a third party.

         7. The parties hereby agree that Schwarz shall have the right,
exercisable by delivering written notice to CIMA at any time on or prior to the
date that is [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] after the date of
this Letter Agreement, to initiate negotiations with CIMA for the development
and supply of the pharmaceutical product [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***] (the "Option Product") in accordance with this paragraph 7. Upon
Schwarz's exercise of such option, the parties shall negotiate in good faith the
specific terms applicable to the Option Product, which terms shall thereupon be
memorialized in a formal license and supply agreement (the "New Agreement");
provided, however that the terms of the New Agreement shall be similar to the
terms of the License Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding, CIMA shall be
obligated to commence development of the Option Product no later than
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] from the later of (i) the effective date
of the New Agreement and (ii) CIMA's receipt of the active ingredient required
for the Option Product.

         8. Section 12 of the License Agreement is hereby, mutatis mutandis,
incorporated by reference as though specifically set forth herein.

         9. This Letter Agreement is binding and enforceable against CIMA and
Schwarz notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the License Agreement,
and, in the event of a conflict between this Letter Agreement and the License
Agreement, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall control.

         10. Each of the undersigned hereby ratifies the License Agreement, as
modified by this Letter Agreement, and agrees that the License Agreement, as
modified hereby, shall continue in full force and effect.

Attention:  Chief Executive Officer

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to the Master Development, License and Supply
Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 (as amended, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "License Agreement"), by and between CIMA LABS
INC., a Delaware corporation ("CIMA") and Schwarz Pharma, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Schwarz"). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this
letter agreement (this "Letter Agreement") shall have the meanings given them in
the License Agreement.

         For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned hereby agrees to modify
the License Agreement as follows:

         7. In order to memorialize the agreement of the parties regarding
changes to the [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] of the Products
numbered 1, 4, 5 and 6 and the final determination of the [***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] of Product number 7, the table set forth on Schedule
3.1 of the License Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with
Exhibit A hereto.

         8. In order to memorialize the agreement of the parties that
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***], Schedule 4.1(b) to the License
Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the definition of [***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] and replacing such definition with the following:
[***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]

         9. The parties hereby agree that, anything to the contrary in the
License Agreement notwithstanding, in addition to blisters and [***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT


<PAGE>
REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***] bottles, CIMA will develop Product # 5 ([***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) for packaging in [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***] bottles. In consideration of the costs associated with such
additional development work, Schwarz shall pay to CIMA a supplemental
development fee equal to [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] upon execution
of this Letter Agreement.

         10. Whereas, the parties have mutually determined that the development
activities heretofore completed in respect of Product # 1 ([***CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***]) have been unsuccessful, the parties hereby agree that
such Product shall be redeveloped in accordance with the Master Development
Schedule contemplated therefore in the License Agreement; provided, however,
that anything to the contrary in the License Agreement notwithstanding, the
parties hereby agree that

                  (a) as part of the development activities in respect of the
New Formulation (as defined below), CIMA shall prepare two batches of each
strength of the New Formulation for filing with the FDA, each of which batches
shall be packaged in both CIMA standard blisters and [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***] bottles,

(b) notwithstanding the Milestone Payments that Schwarz has heretofore made to
    CIMA pursuant to Schedule 4.1(b) of the License Agreement in respect of
    Product #1, but in lieu of any other Milestone Payments that Schwarz may be
    required to make in respect of Product #1 pursuant to the License Agreement,
    Schwarz shall make the following Milestone Payments to CIMA in accordance
    with the License Agreement and this Letter Agreement with respect to the
    development of the New Formulation:

(c) CIMA shall not be eligible to receive the payment referred to in Section
    (c)(ii) on Schedule 4.1(b) of the License Agreement in respect of the New
    Formulation.

                  For purposes hereof, Product #1 ([***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***]), redeveloped as contemplated in this paragraph 4 shall be
referred to herein as the "New Formulation". The parties agree and acknowledge
that the New

Formulation shall for all purposes be Product # 1 and a Product within the
meaning of the License Agreement.

         11. Section 12 of the License Agreement is hereby, mutatis mutandis,
incorporated by reference as though specifically set forth herein.

         12. This Letter Agreement is binding and enforceable against CIMA and
Schwarz notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the License Agreement,
and, in the event of a conflict between this Letter Agreement and the License
Agreement, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall control.

         13. Each of the undersigned hereby ratifies the License Agreement, as
modified by this Letter Agreement, and agrees that the License Agreement, as
modified hereby, shall continue in full force and effect.
