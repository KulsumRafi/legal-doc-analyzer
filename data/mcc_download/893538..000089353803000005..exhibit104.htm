substitutions  therefor (the "Nonrecourse  Secured Promissory Note"), the Debtor

title and interest  (whether  now  existing or  hereafter  acquired and wherever
located)  of the Debtor in and to the  following  (the  "Collateral")  to secure
payment and  performance of all of the Debtor's  present and future  obligations

         foregoing.

         Except as set forth below, the Debt shall otherwise be without recourse

or through  the  Debtor.  The Debtor has and will have at all times full  right,
power and  authority  to grant a  security  interest  in the  Collateral  to the
Secured Party as provided herein,  free and clear of any lien, adverse claim, or
encumbrance made by, under,  from or through  Debtor.The  Debtor will defend any
proceeding which may materially  affect title to or the Secured Party's security
interest  in any  Collateral  to the extent that the claim  arises by,  through,
under  or from  the  Debtor,  and  will  indemnify  the  Secured  Party  for all
reasonable  costs and  expenses  of the Secured  Party's  defense  against  such
claims.

               2. The  Debtor  will pay when due all  future  charges,  liens or
encumbrances on the Collateral arising by, through, under or from the Debtor and
all taxes and assessments  hereafter levied or imposed on or adversely affecting
the  Collateral  provided  that  the  foregoing  need  not be paid  while  being
diligently  contested in good faith and by  appropriate  proceedings  so long as
adequate reserves have been established with respect thereto.

               3. All certificates  evidencing the Collateral shall be delivered
to the  Secured  Party  on or  prior  to the  execution  and  delivery  of  this
Agreement, and all such certificates shall be held by the Secured Party pursuant
hereto and shall be delivered in suitable form for transfer by delivery with any
necessary  endorsement or shall be accompanied by fully executed  instruments of
transfer or assignment in blank,  all in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Secured Party.

               4.  The   Secured   Party  is   irrevocably   appointed   as  the

paragraph  1 of  section  (C) and  after  giving  effect to any  relevant  grace
periods) to do any act which the Debtor is  obligated  hereby to do, to exercise
such rights as the Debtor might exercise, and to execute and file in the name of
the Debtor any financing  statements and amendments  thereto required to perfect
the Secured Party's security interest hereunder, all to protect and preserve the

during the continuation of a Default,  the Secured Party may at its option,  and

Party's  acceptance of partial or delinquent  payments or failure of the Secured

         dividends  which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain
         pursuant to  subsection (1) of this section shall  automatically cease,
         and all such rights shall thereupon  become vested in the Secured Party
         which  shall  thereupon  have  the  sole right to  receive and  hold as
         Collateral such dividends;

                   (b) without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  the
         Secured  Party  may  at its  option  exercise  any  and  all  rights of
         conversion, exchange,  subscription or any  other rights, privileges or
         options pertaining to any of the Collateral  as if it were the absolute
