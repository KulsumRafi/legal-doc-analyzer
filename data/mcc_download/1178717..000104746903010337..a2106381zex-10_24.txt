     HOLDINGS SENIOR NOTE REFINANCING OBLIGATIONS").".

          5.     Section 7 of the Subordination Agreement is hereby further
amended by (i) deleting the definition of "PERMANENT SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTE

     of the Holdings Senior Notes.

          "PERMANENT SENIOR NOTEHOLDERS" shall mean the holders from time to
     time of the Permanent Senior Notes.

          "PERMITTED HOLDINGS SENIOR NOTE REFINANCING CREDITORS" shall mean the
     holders from time to time of Permitted Holdings Senior Note Refinancing
     Indebtedness.

          "PERMITTED SENIOR NOTE REFINANCING CREDITORS" shall mean the holders

III. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

          1.     In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Amendment,
each Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and warrants that:

          (a)    no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Sixth Amendment
     Effective Date, both immediately before and immediately after giving effect
     to this Amendment; and

          (b)    all of the representations and warranties contained in the
     Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all
     material respects on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date both immediately
     before and immediately after giving effect to this Amendment, with the same
     effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and
     as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date (it being understood that any
     representation or warranty made as of a specific date shall be true and
     correct in all material respects as of such specific date).

          2.     This Amendment is limited as specified and shall not constitute
a modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Credit
Agreement, the Subordination Agreement or any other Credit Document.

          3.     This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts
and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with Holdings and the Administrative Agent.

          4.     THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

          5.     This Amendment shall become effective on the date (the "Sixth
Amendment Effective Date") when each of the following conditions shall have been
satisfied; PROVIDED that the Sixth Amendment Effective Date may occur
concurrently with the last of such conditions to be satisfied:

          (i) each Credit Agreement Party, each Party (as defined in the
     Subordination Agreement) party to the Subordination Agreement, the
     Administrative Agent, the Lenders constituting the Required Lenders and the
     Lenders holding Tranche A Term Loans constituting the Majority Lenders of
     such Tranche of Term Loans shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether
     the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered (including by
     way of facsimile transmission) the same to the Administrative Agent at its
     Notice Office;

          (ii) the Lenders shall have received an amendment to the Senior
     Subordinated Credit Agreement executed by Vertis, the subsidiaries of
     Vertis party thereto and the Required Lenders under, and as defined in, the
     Senior Subordinated Credit Agreement, which amendment shall permit the
     issuance of the Permanent Senior Notes and otherwise be in form and
     substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;

          (iii) Holdings and Vertis shall have paid to the Administrative Agent
     and the Lenders all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and
     expenses but excluding the Amendment Fee referred to Section 6 below)
     payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to the extent then due;

          (iv) the Permanent Senior Notes shall have been issued generating Net
     Cash Proceeds of at least $240.0 million and at least $132.5 million of
     such Net Cash Proceeds shall have been applied to repay Loans in accordance
     with the requirements of the Credit Agreement (as amended hereby); and

          (v) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate signed
     on behalf of Holdings by an appropriate officer of Holdings, stating that
     the conditions in clauses (iii) and (iv) above and Section 5.03(a) of the
     Credit Agreement have been satisfied on such date.

In the event the condition described in clause (iv) above shall not have been
satisfied on or prior to September 30, 2002, any signature page to this
Amendment theretofore tendered by any Lender shall be deemed withdrawn at such
time and clause (i) above shall thereafter be deemed not to be satisfied.

                                      -24-

          6.     The Borrowers hereby covenant and agree (on a joint and several
basis) that, so long as the Sixth Amendment Effective Date occurs, they shall
pay (in U.S. Dollars) to each Lender which executes and delivers to the
Administrative Agent (or its designee) a counterpart hereof by 12:00 Noon (New
York City time) on June 13, 2002, a non-refundable cash fee (the "Amendment
Fee") in an amount equal to 12.5 basis points (0.125%) of an amount equal to the
sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans made by such Lender
and outstanding on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date (after giving effect to
the repayment of Term Loans of such Lender on such date with the Net Cash
Proceeds from the issuance of Permanent Senior Notes) PLUS (ii) the Revolving
Loan Commitment of such Lender as in effect on the Sixth Amendment Effective
Date, which Amendment Fee shall not be subject to counterclaim or set-off, or be
otherwise affected by, any claim or dispute relating to any other matter and
shall be paid by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent for distribution to
the Lenders not later than the second Business Day following the Sixth Amendment
Effective Date.

          7.     From and after the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, all
references in the Credit Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents to the
Credit Agreement and the Subordination Agreement shall be deemed to be
references to the Credit Agreement or the Subordination Agreement, as the case
may be, as modified hereby.

                                      * * *
