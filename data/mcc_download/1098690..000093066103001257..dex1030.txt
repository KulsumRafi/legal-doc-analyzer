                "'New Common Shares' means the `New Common Shares' referred to
     in Amendment No. 1 to this Agreement dated as of November 1, 2001 and the
     `New Common Shares' referred to in Amendment No. 2 to this Agreement dated
     as of November 20, 2002."

          (b)   Section VIII (1) of the Stockholders Agreement is amended by

Stockholder as of November 20, 2002" (the "Second Amendment Effective Date")" in
lieu thereof.

          (c)   Section VIII (1) of the Stockholders Agreement is amended by
deleting the text "held by such Stockholder on the date hereof" appearing in the
proviso at the end of said Section and inserting the text "held by such
Stockholder on the Second Amendment Effective Date" in lieu thereof.

          (d)   Section IX of the Stockholders Agreement is amended by deleting
the text "held by the Schedule I Purchasers on the Effective Date" appearing
therein and inserting the text "held by the Schedule I Purchasers on the Second
Amendment Effective Date" in lieu thereof.

          (e)   All references to "FFT" or to the "FFT Purchasers" contained in
the Stockholders Agreement shall be deleted and replaced by references to "FFC"

         (b) This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

         (c) Headings and section reference numbers in this Amendment are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Amendment.

         (d) This Amendment is limited precisely as written and shall not be
deemed to be a modification, acceptance or waiver of any other term, condition
