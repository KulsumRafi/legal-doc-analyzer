agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant the sum of Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($240,000.00). As further consideration for services rendered hereunder, the Company shall pay Consultant
during the Term a retainer (the "Retainer") consisting of (i)&nbsp;$80,000 per month payable on the first day of each calendar month during the Term; and (ii)&nbsp;$15,000 per year payable not in
cash but in complimentary travel privileges on the Company's scheduled passenger flights which Consultant may extend to its officers, directors, employees, representatives, contractors or
subcontractors (collectively, the "Consultant Representatives") and to other individuals in accordance with the Company's barter travel program provided to its senior executives. Any such barter
travel may be used by Consultant during the Term hereof or at anytime thereafter. Consultant shall be responsible for any personal
income tax liability arising from such barter travel privileges. The Retainer shall be prorated for any partial month during the Term. In addition, the Company shall reimburse Consultant for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Consultant in connection with services rendered hereunder, provided that any expenses in excess of $5,000 shall be subject to
pre-approval by the CEO. Consultant shall submit to the Company on a monthly basis a detailed invoice setting forth an itemization of any expenses reimbursable by the Company hereunder
together with supporting receipts therefor. The Company shall make available to Consultant and its employees performing services hereunder one office and appropriate secretarial support. In addition,
the Company shall make available to Consultant one in-door parking space at the Company's offices and at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, as required in connection with the

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Contractor.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and Consultant acknowledge and agree that Consultant is an independent
contractor, and not an agent of the Company, and neither Consultant nor any employee of Consultant will have any authority to act hereunder as an agent of the Company except on authority specifically
so delegated, and neither Consultant nor any employee of Consultant shall represent to the contrary to any person. Consultant shall not direct the work of any employee of the Company, or make any
management decisions, or undertake to commit the Company to any course of action in relation to third persons. Although the Company may specify the results to be achieved by Consultant and may control
and direct Consultant in that regard, the Company shall not control or direct Consultant as to the details or means by which such results are accomplished. The Company will have no obligation
whatsoever to provide any employee benefits or privileges of any kind or nature to any person performing services hereunder, including Mr.&nbsp;Foret, other than those benefits or privileges to
which Mr.&nbsp;Foret is entitled by virtue of his prior employment with the Company. Consultant will pay its own employees and shall pay any and all legally required withholding taxes, social
security, unemployment, and workers' compensation insurance and similar items in connection with compensation paid to its employees. Consultant will ensure that its employees are aware of their status
as employees of Consultant and not the Company. Consultant will be responsible for compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws related to the employer/employee relationship with
respect to Consultant's employees. Further, Consultant agrees that the Company is not responsible to collect or withhold federal, state or local taxes with respect to services provided by Consultant's
employees, including income tax and social security, and that any and all taxes imposed, assessed or levied as a result of this Agreement or the amounts payable to Consultant hereunder shall be paid
by Consultant, or if paid by the Company, Consultant shall reimburse the Company upon demand. </FONT></P>

(or any affiliate thereof) that (x)&nbsp;competes with the Company, (y)&nbsp;provides regional airline services to the Company or (z)&nbsp;provides charter lift to MLT&nbsp;Inc. For the
avoidance of doubt, a regional air carrier that operates flights under the designator code of an airline that competes with the Company shall be deemed to compete with the Company. The parties hereby
acknowledge that Mr.&nbsp;Foret is currently serving on the boards of directors of Grand Holdings,&nbsp;Inc. (d/b/a Champion Air) and GHI-CA
Corporation as the Company's designated director and agree that such service shall be permitted pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5(a) only for so long as he continues to serve as the Company's
designated director at the Company's request. Mr.&nbsp;Foret may resign from such boards in his sole discretion, and agrees to resign from such boards immediately upon the request of the Company,
and no resignation by Mr.&nbsp;Foret from such boards shall constitute a breach of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that, with respect to his service as a director of such companies,
Mr.&nbsp;Foret is subject to certain fiduciary duties under applicable law and nothing herein shall be deemed to require Mr.&nbsp;Foret to act in a manner that violates his fiduciary obligations
to such companies. </FONT></P>

irreparable injury and damage for which there would be no adequate remedy at law, and that, in the event of said breach or any threat of breach, the Company shall be entitled to an immediate
injunction and restraining order to prevent such breach or threatened breach, without having to prove damages, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in
equity. Consultant further agrees that the provisions of the covenant not to compete are reasonable. Should a court determine, however, that any provision of the covenant not to compete is
unreasonable, either in period of time, geographical area, or otherwise, the parties hereto agree that the covenant should be interpreted and enforced to the maximum extent which such court deems
reasonable. The existence of any claim or cause of action or otherwise (other than the failure to pay amounts owed under Section&nbsp;3, the failure to provide indemnification and insurance in
accordance with Section&nbsp;10, or an assignment by Northwest in breach of Section&nbsp;11), shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of the covenants and agreements of this
Section&nbsp;5. </FONT></P>
