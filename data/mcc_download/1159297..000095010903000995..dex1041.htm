the achievement of Performance Goals, the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer shall disregard the impact of regulatory changes (such as changes to applicable accounting rules) made after the Performance Goals were established, as well as the
impact of extraordinary items. The Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may determine that such actual Award amount will be less or more than, but not more, than the amount determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Award
Opportunity when it was originally established. </LI> <U></p> <b>Section 2.3</b><p>Limitation on Awards</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the actual amount of any single Short-Term Award or Long-Term Award paid to any Participant
may not exceed $2,000,000.</p> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;<p>Article III<BR> Payment of Awards</LI></p> </P> </B><U> <p><b>Section 3.1</b></p> <p>Normal Payment Schedule</U>. If a Participant becomes entitled to a payment with respect to any Award
Opportunity, such payment shall be made to the Participant in cash, as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of all requirements for receipt of such payment; </LI> </p> <P>provided, that such payment (a) shall not be made earlier than the
time provided for in the applicable Award Opportunity, (b) may be deferred by the Participant in accordance with the terms of any deferred compensation plan of the Company in which he or she participates, to the extent allowed by such plan (a

shall be as set forth below, unless otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Opportunity.</LI> <OL TYPE="a"> <U><LI>Voluntary Termination; Termination for Cause</U>. If a Participant experiences a Termination of
Employment by the Participant's voluntary action (other than as a result of the Participant's death, Disability or Retirement), or by the Company for Cause, the Participant shall forfeit all Award Opportunities and all rights to receive payments of
Awards that have been earned but not previously been paid to him or her (except to the extent not paid by reason of a Deferral, in which event the consequences of such Termination of Employment shall be governed by the applicable deferred
compensation plan).</LI> <U><LI>Death, Disability and Retirement</U>. If a Participant experiences a Termination of Employment as a result of the Participant's death, Disability or Retirement, or by the Company for Cause, then (i) if the Committee
or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company so determines, in its sole discretion, the Participant, or the Participant's estate, shall be entitled to receive payments with respect to Award Opportunities for which the performance period has not yet
ended at the date of such Termination of Employment, at such times and in such amounts as would have applied, had the Participant not experienced a Termination of Employment (provided, that the amounts so paid may, in the Committee's or the Chief
Executive Officer's discretion, be pro-rated to reflect the timing of the Termination of Employment); and (ii) any payments with respect to Awards that have been earned but not yet paid at the time of the Termination of Employment shall be paid to
the Participant, or the Participant's estate, as soon as practicable after the Termination of Employment (except to the extent not paid by reason of a Deferral, in which event the consequences of such Termination of Employment shall be governed by
the applicable deferred compensation plan).</LI> <U><LI>Other Terminations</U>. If the Participant experiences a Termination of Employment for any reason not described in Sections 3.2(a) and (b) above, the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer
shall determine, in its sole discretion, the extent to which the Participant may receive payments with respect to any then-outstanding Awards and Award Opportunities; provided, that in no event shall such payments exceed the amounts that would have
been paid had the Participant not experienced a Termination of Employment; and provided, further, that with respect to any Awards that have been earned but not paid by reason of a Deferral, the consequences of such Termination of Employment shall be
governed by the applicable deferred compensation plan.</LI></OL> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Article IV<BR> Amendment and Termination of Plan</LI></P> </B><P>The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company; provided, that no such amendment or termination may alter the terms and conditions of any then-outstanding Award Opportunity or Award in a manner adverse to the Participant without the Participant's consent, and no such amendment or
termination may alter the terms and conditions of any then-outstanding Award Opportunity or Award in a manner favorable to the Participant or that would otherwise cause such Award Opportunity or Award to cease to qualify for the Section 162(m)
Exemption.</P> <P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned adopts this plan document effective February 26, 2002. </P> <P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<U>/s/ John A. Luke, Jr.&#9;&#9;&#9;<br> </U>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;John A. Luke, Jr.<br>
