      "Title Impairment" means a claim, charge or other matter affecting title

the terms and conditions thereof and matters which constitute Tenant Events.

      2.(a) (i) If, at the time title to the Leased Interests is to be conveyed
by SHC to or as directed by Citadel Cinemas by reason of the timely and proper
exercise of the Lease Option (or if, at the time notice of such exercise would
be required to be given, such timely and proper exercise is stayed by an
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), title to any Covered Asset shall be
subject to a Lien other than a Permitted Lien or to a Title Impairment and
provided the Beneficiaries are able to provide to the Guarantors evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Guarantors that the respective Beneficiaries are
then Prepared to close, then the Guarantors shall be obligated to pay, bond, or

      (b)(i) If, at the time title to the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees is to be
conveyed to or as directed by FeeSub by reason of the timely and proper exercise

required to be given, such timely and proper exercise is stayed by an Insolvency
or Liquidation Proceeding), title to any part of the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees
shall be subject to a Lien or to a Title Impairment, in either case arising
solely from or relating to any action or omission by SHC or an Affiliate which
is not a Tenant Event and provided the Beneficiaries are able to provide to the
Guarantors evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Guarantors that the

be obligated to pay, bond, or otherwise Cure such Lien and to Cure such Title
Impairment.

            (ii) Not less than ten days prior to the date of the anticipated
transfer described in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 2, FeeSub shall deliver
to the Guarantors a Certificate of Title with respect to the asset or assets to
be transferred indicating whether or not any Liens encumbering such title
constitute such Liens other than Permitted Liens and whether there exist any
such Title Impairments, each as described in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 2,
together with evidence of FeeSub's ability to close as aforesaid.

Proceeding, (i) SHC shall fail to convey or cause to be conveyed title to any of
the Leased Interests, at the time provided in the Lease Agreement, (ii) Citadel
Cinemas shall be stayed from exercising the Lease Option on a timely basis,
(iii) SHC shall fail to cause the Sutton/Murray Hill Fee Option to be exercised
on a timely basis or to cause the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees to be delivered to
or as directed by FeeSub at the time provided in the Sutton/Murray Hill Fee
Option and the Fee Option Agreement, or (iv) FeeSub shall be stayed from
exercising the Fee Option Right on a timely basis, then, provided all conditions
to such transfer or exercise, as the case may be, which then should have been
satisfied by Citadel Cinemas or FeeSub, as the case may be, have been satisfied
(excluding, however, those conditions which could not have been satisfied by
reason of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Guarantors shall cause
such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding to be terminated or otherwise to be
resolved as promptly as practicable and in a manner such that, or take such
other actions as may be necessary so that, the applicable transaction can be
consummated in accordance with its terms. Any such action may include causing
SHC to apply to any liability or claim, or distribute to its member for
application to any liability or claim of, funds available or to be available to
SHC in connection with consummation of the applicable transactions or otherwise,
after payment of any obligations owing by it to either Beneficiary or any
Affiliates of either Beneficiary. All times referred to in this Section 2(c)
shall be determined without regard to any additional time that may be permitted
or authorized under any statute or order entered in or applicable to such
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

      (d) Any provisions of subsection 2(c) or Section 3 hereof to the contrary
notwithstanding, if an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is a Beneficiary
Proceeding, then (i) each of the Beneficiaries shall defer claims or actions
hereunder against either of the Guarantors and the exercise of its rights
pursuant to said Section 3 until the earliest of (A) the issuance of a Final
Order in connection with such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding precluding,
or with the result of precluding, the consummation of the Closing with respect
to the transfer of the Leased Interest or the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees, as the
case may be, or otherwise declaring as null and void or otherwise unenforceable
the Lease Option or the Fee Option Agreement (assuming in any such instance that
the applicable Beneficiary had properly exercised its rights pursuant to the
Lease Option or the Fee Option Agreement, as applicable, or had been stayed from
so doing by reason of the filing of the Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding),
(B) the rejection of the Lease Option or the Fee Option Agreement as an
executory obligation of SHC, (C) the issuance of a Final Order inconsistent with
a Bad Faith Determination, (D) 30 days after such Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding is dismissed, (E) such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is
converted, (F) a plan is confirmed in any such Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding (unless such plan provides for the consummation of the Closing of the
transfer of the Leased Interest or the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees, or both, as
the case may be), and (G) the termination of the term of the Lease Agreement
(after giving effect to any extension of the Lease Term, so long as the periods
to exercise and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Lease Option and
Fee Option Agreement have also been extended for the same period) and (ii) any
statute of limitations or similar defense applicable to such deferred claims or
actions against the Guarantors hereunder is deemed tolled during such Insolvency
or Liquidation Proceeding; provided, however, that, if a Bad Faith Determination
is issued with respect to such


                                       6
<PAGE>

Beneficiary Proceeding, then the statute of limitations and similar defenses
will not be deemed tolled.

      3. In the event the Guarantors do not timely perform any of the above
obligations, any Beneficiary may, after written demand to perform has been
served upon the Guarantors and the Guarantors have been given 15 days to
perform, perform said obligations at the Guarantors' sole cost and expense;
provided, however, that no Beneficiary shall exercise its option to perform said
obligations for up to 90 days if within said 15-day period the Guarantors have
commenced to perform the obligation or obligations in question and thereafter to
the reasonable satisfaction of such Beneficiary continue to perform such
obligation or obligations with reasonable diligence; and provided, further, that
such 15-day period, and the preceding proviso, shall not apply if such
Beneficiary reasonably concludes that delay in exercising its right hereunder
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate
the closing on a timely basis in accordance with the Lease Agreement or the
closing of the transfer of the Sutton & Murray Hill Fees in accordance with the
Fee Option Agreement or the Sutton/Murray Hill Fee Option. The Beneficiaries'
exercise of or failure to exercise their rights under this Section 3 shall not
relieve the Guarantors of their obligations under this Agreement. The Guarantors
shall, upon written demand from a Beneficiary, reimburse such Beneficiary for
all costs, including reasonable attorney's fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and
all liabilities incurred by such Beneficiary by reason of the foregoing, with
interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate.

      4. The obligations, covenants, agreements and duties of the Guarantors
under this Agreement shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason of the
occurrence from time to time of any of the following with respect to the Lease
Agreement, the Fee Option Agreement or this Agreement, even though notice may
not have been given to, or received from, the Guarantors or the further consent
of either Guarantor thereto may not have been obtained: (a) any amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of or supplement to the Lease Agreement, or
the Fee Option Agreement or any agreement, instrument or document executed or
delivered pursuant thereto or in connection therewith (collectively the
"Documents"); (b) the validity or enforceability of any of the Documents; or (c)
any exercise or non-exercise of any right, power or remedy under or in respect
of any of the Documents or arising at law.

      5. Except as expressly set forth herein, the agreements of each of the
Guarantors set forth in this Agreement constitute the absolute, present,
primary, continuing, irrevocable, unlimited and unconditional obligations of the
Guarantors in accordance with the terms hereof, without limitation, and are not
conditioned or contingent upon any effort to attempt to seek payment or
performance from the other Guarantor or any other person or entity (whether or
not pursuant to this Agreement) or upon any other condition or contingency;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall obligate the Guarantors hereunder
if Citadel Cinemas or FeeSub, as applicable, shall fail to satisfy the
conditions for proper and timely exercise of the Lease Option or the Fee Option
Right, as applicable (excepting only those conditions which cannot reasonably be
satisfied by reason of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding). The obligations
of the Guarantors set forth herein constitute full recourse obligations of each
Guarantor enforceable against him to the full extent of all his assets and
properties, notwithstanding any provision in the Lease Agreement or Fee Option
Agreement


                                       7
<PAGE>

limiting the liability of any Person. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed and understood that repeated and successive demands for performance
hereunder may be made and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall apply to each and every subsequent event to which it applies by its
terms. The Guarantors assume full responsibility for being and staying informed
as to all facts and circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonperformance of the
obligations guaranteed hereunder, and the Guarantors agree that the
Beneficiaries shall have no obligation to advise the Guarantors or any of them
of information known to the Beneficiaries regarding such condition or any other
circumstance.

      6. The Guarantors irrevocably waive (i) any and every right they may have
to injunctive relief, (ii) any and every right they may have to have any suit,
action or proceeding brought by the Beneficiaries on this Agreement consolidated
with any other or separate suit, action or proceeding, and (iii) the right, in
such suit, action, proceeding or counterclaim, to interpose any counterclaims
(except to the extent that such counterclaims are compulsory and may not be
brought in a separate action) or setoffs of any kind or description.

      7 Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay on the part of
any Beneficiary in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right
hereunder or the failure to exercise same in any instance preclude other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right; nor shall
any Beneficiary be liable for exercising or failing to exercise any such power
or right. The rights and remedies hereunder expressly specified are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Beneficiary may or will
otherwise have.

      8 The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be joint and several
obligations.

      9 In case any Document or obligation thereunder shall be terminated or
rejected by any trustee, receiver or liquidating agent of SHC or any of its
properties in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the Guarantors'
obligations hereunder shall continue to the same extent as if such Document had
not been so rejected or terminated. The Guarantors agree that this Agreement
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time any payment or performance by SHC is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned as a result of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

      10 The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any
counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense (other than payment, performance or
affirmative discharge, release or termination of this Agreement by the
Beneficiaries in writing) based upon any claim the Guarantors or SHC may have
against any Beneficiary (except for claims that may not be asserted in a
separate action or proceeding) or the Guarantors may have against SHC or any
other Person and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and
shall not be released, discharged, reduced or in any way affected by, any
circumstance or condition (whether or not the Guarantors shall have any
knowledge or notice thereof) whatsoever which might constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense; provided, however, that the Guarantors shall not
be precluded from asserting, whether by way of defense or otherwise, the failure
by Citadel Cinemas or FeeSub, as applicable, to satisfy the conditions to the
proper and timely exercise of the Lease Option or the Fee Option Right, as the
case


                                       8
<PAGE>

may be (excepting those conditions which could not be so satisfied by reason of
an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding).

      11 Except as specifically provided herein, the Guarantors unconditionally
waive: (a) notice of any of the matters referred to in Section 4 or 10 hereof;
(b) all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to
preserve any rights against the Guarantors hereunder, including notice of the
acceptance of this Agreement; (c) except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein, any requirement for the enforcement, assertion or exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of any Document, including
diligence in collection or protection of or realization upon any obligations or
any part thereof or any collateral therefor; (d) any requirement of diligence;
(e) any requirement to mitigate the damages resulting from a default under any
Document, except that this shall not relieve the Beneficiaries of any such
obligation; or (f) the occurrence of every other condition precedent to which
the Guarantors or SHC may otherwise be entitled, except as provided in any
Document.

      12 Any Beneficiary may, at its election, exercise any right or remedy it
might have against SHC or any security held by such Beneficiary, including the
right to foreclose upon any such security by judicial or nonjudicial sale,
without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Guarantors
hereunder, and the Guarantors waive any defense arising out of the absence,
impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation or
any other right or remedy of the Guarantors against SHC or any such security,
whether resulting from such election by a Beneficiary or otherwise. The
Guarantors waive any defense arising by reason of any disability or other
defense of SHC (which may nevertheless be asserted in a separate action or
proceeding against the Beneficiaries or any other party), or by reason of the
cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability, either in whole or in
part, of SHC to a Beneficiary (other than as a result of payment, performance or
affirmative discharge, release or termination of this Agreement by the
Beneficiaries).

      13 The Guarantor understands that the Beneficiaries' exercise of certain
rights and remedies contained in the Documents may affect or eliminate the
Guarantors' rights of subrogation against SHC and that the Guarantors may
therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability hereunder;
nevertheless, the Guarantors hereby authorize and empower the Beneficiaries to
exercise, in its or their sole discretion, any rights and remedies, or any
combination thereof, which may then be available, it being the purpose and
intent of each Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute,
independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances.

      14 Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Beneficiaries that, as to
himself, the following statements are true and correct in all material respects
as of the date hereof:

            (a) Guarantor has full power and authority to execute, deliver and
      perform its obligations under this Agreement. No consent of any other
      person, and no authorization of, notice to, or other act by or in respect
      of the Guarantor by or with any Governmental Authority, is required in
      connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
      enforceability of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed
      and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
      obligation of the Guarantor,


                                       9
<PAGE>

      enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as
      the enforceability of this Agreement may be limited by the effect of any
      applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar
      laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
      equity.

            (b) Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the Guarantor
      of this Agreement will violate any provision or any existing Law
      applicable to the Guarantor or any order or decree applicable to the
      Guarantor of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority, or of any
      mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or undertaking to
      which the Guarantor is a party or by which the Guarantor or any of his
      properties or assets is bound, or will result in the creation or
      imposition of any lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest on any of
      the properties or assets of the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of
      any of the foregoing.

            (c) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation at law or
      in equity by or before any court, governmental body, agency, commission or
      other tribunal now pending or threatened in writing against or affecting
      the Guarantor or any property or rights of the Guarantor or questioning
      the enforceability of this Agreement which, if adversely determined, could
      reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the
      business, assets, properties, revenues, financial condition, operations or
      prospects of the Guarantor or (b) the ability of the Guarantor to perform
      its obligations under this Agreement in a timely manner.

      15 In no event shall the Guarantors have any liability to any Beneficiary
hereunder for any lost or prospective profits or any other special, punitive,
exemplary, consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages (in tort,
contract or otherwise). The parties further agree that no claim for direct
damages by a party hereunder shall include any amounts for which such party has
been reimbursed or is entitled to be reimbursed under any insurance required to
be obtained under the Lease Agreement or acquired in connection therewith.

      16 Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 9 hereof, this
Agreement, and the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder, shall expire,
terminate and be of no further force and effect on and after the earlier of the
end of the Initial Term or the date of the Closing provided SHC complies with
its obligations in respect thereof.

      17 The Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way
of subrogation hereunder, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all
of the obligations of SHC to the Beneficiaries under the Documents have been
indefeasibly paid in full in cash and performed in full. If any amount shall be
paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all
of such obligations shall not have been paid in full in cash, such amount shall
be held in trust for the benefit of the Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be
paid as provided herein to be credited and applied upon such obligations, in
accordance with the terms of the Documents.

Agreement shall be fully performed in accordance with the terms hereof.

SEEK AND HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO ANY REVIEW OF THE JUDGMENT OF ANY SUCH COURT
