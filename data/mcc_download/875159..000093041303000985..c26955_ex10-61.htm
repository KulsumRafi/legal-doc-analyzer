The Agent hereby covenants and agrees with XLReB that the Agent will not originate entitlement orders to the Securities Intermediary concerning any Collateral Account unless and until there has been an &#147; Event of Default&#148; under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing covenant is for the benefit of XLReB and shall not constitute a limitation on the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to act upon and comply with any entitlement orders concerning any Collateral Account that are originated by the Agent at any time.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Intermediary agrees that following its receipt of notice from the Agent in substantially the form of Annex A hereto (the &#147;Notice of Exclusive Control&#148;) of the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Securities Intermediary shall not, unless such Notice of Exclusive Control has been revoked in writing by the Agent, (i)&nbsp;permit any sale, disposition, substitution or withdrawal of, or additional encumbrance upon, any Control Collateral or release any Control Collateral for any reason, without the prior written consent of the Agent, or (ii)&nbsp;follow any entitlement order or other instruction of XLReB in respect of the Control Collateral.</font></p>

As used herein the term &#147;Custodian&#146;s Overdraft Advance&#148; shall mean any advance of cash or securities by the Custodian to or for the benefit of XLReB, including any overdraft fees. In addition, the Securities Intermediary expressly agrees that it shall not utilize any Control Collateral or dispose of any Control Collateral to satisfy any obligation of XLReB or any other person or entity to the Securities Intermediary (as securities intermediary, custodian or otherwise) under this Agreement, any Custodial Agreement or any other agreement or document (i) except as expressly permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in, clauses (x) and (y) above, and (ii) without giving XLReB and the Agent at least fourteen (14) days prior written notice thereof.</font></p>

The Securities Intermediary shall have no duty to investigate or determine whether an Event of Default has occurred and shall comply with a Notice of Exclusive Control even if it believes that no such Event of Default exists. Unless and until the Securities Intermediary shall have received a Notice of Exclusive Control or if any previous Notice of Exclusive Control has been revoked in writing by the Agent, the Securities Intermediary shall </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>3</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2><PAGE>
