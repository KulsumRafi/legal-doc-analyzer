(the "Commitment Period") from the Initial Drawdown Date to and including the

secured by the Collateral. The Lender, in its sole discretion or as provided in
Section 2.2(d), may at the request of the Borrower given at any time after the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date make loans earlier than the Initial
Drawdown Date. Within the limits of the Commitment, the Borrower may borrow
under this Section 2.1 and prepay pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof. Any principal
amount repaid, by prepayment or otherwise, may not be reborrowed, and the
Commitment shall be reduced by the amount so borrowed and repaid. The sum of the
principal amount at any time of all Outstanding Loans made by the Lender
pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed eighteen million Dollars
($18,000,000).

      2.2 Manner of Borrowing.

            (a) The Borrower shall give the Lender (i) for any Loan proposed to
be made on or before or within ninety (90) days following the Initial Drawdown
Date, a duly completed Notice of Borrowing in the form of Exhibit B attached
hereto not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) not less than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the date designated by the Borrower as the date of
advance for such Loan, and (ii) for any Loan proposed to be made any time
thereafter, a duly completed Notice of Borrowing not later than 3:00 P.M. (New
York City time) not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date
designated by the Borrower as the date of advance for such Loan. Each Notice of
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

            (b) Each such Notice of Borrowing shall specify: (i) the amount of
such Loan, which shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $25,000
(or, if the then unused


                                       11
<PAGE>

Commitment is less than $25,000, such lesser amount); and (ii) the date of such
borrowing, which shall be a Business Day during the Commitment Period (unless
the Lender agrees to make a Loan earlier than the Initial Drawdown Date).

            (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Lender shall make the amount of each Loan available to the Borrower by
transferring the amount thereof on the date of the advance specified by the
Borrower to an account designated by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing.

            (d) At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date,
subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2(d), the Lender may give the
Borrower a notice (a "Mandatory Borrowing or Reduction Notice") requiring the
Borrower to either (i) give a Notice of Borrowing for a Loan in an amount equal
to the then unused amount of the Commitment, as provided in Section 2.2(a)(i),
or (ii) give a notice under Section 3.4 reducing the Commitment, as of the date
of such notice, to the amount of Loans then outstanding. If the Borrower does
not give either a Notice of Borrowing or a notice reducing the Commitment, as
required by this Section 2.2(d), within 30 days of the date of the Mandatory
Borrowing or Reduction Notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given on
such 30th day a notice as described in Section 2.2(d)(ii).

      2.3 Repayment of Principal. The Borrower shall repay the Lender the
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Loans on the Final Date (or such
earlier date as is required pursuant to Section 2.6) in accordance with the
terms of the Note.

      2.4 Payment of Interest.

            (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Loan, if any, owing to the Lender from the date of such Loan to the date
on which such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate equal to the
Interest Rate, payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date.

            (b) Regardless of any provision contained in this Agreement or any
other Related Document, in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the
aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement or the Note and
charged or collected pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof exceed the highest
rate permissible under Applicable Law. It is the intent of the parties hereof to
comply with all Applicable Laws relating to interest and usury and, if the
Lender shall inadvertently charge or receive interest hereunder in excess of the
highest applicable rate, the Lender shall promptly refund such excess interest
to the Borrower and such rate shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate
permitted by Applicable Law.

      2.5 Voluntary Prepayment. Subject in each case to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Borrower may, on 10 day's prior written notice to
Lender, prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding Loans. The
Borrower may not otherwise prepay any Loan without the consent of the Lender,
except as required by this Agreement. Any prepayment must be accompanied


                                       12
<PAGE>

by the payment of accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of
prepayment. Amounts so prepaid shall be applied to the remaining installments
due in respect of the Loans in inverse order of maturity.

      2.6 Mandatory Prepayment. Subject in each case to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement:

            (a) If Citadel Cinemas exercises the Purchase Option (as defined in
      the Lease Agreement), the Borrower shall prepay all Obligations in full on
      the Purchase Option Closing Date (as defined in the Lease Agreement);
      provided that, if Citadel Cinemas shall fail or refuse to close, then the
      Borrower shall have no obligation to prepay as herein set forth; and

            (b) If the Borrower shall receive and, pursuant to the terms of the
      Lease Agreement, be entitled to retain any insurance proceeds resulting
      from damage to any of its Assets (including proceeds of insurance
      maintained by Citadel Cinemas), or proceeds resulting from any Taking (as
      defined in the Lease Agreement) or shall receive a payment pursuant to
      clause (i) of paragraph (c) of Section 19 of the Lease Agreement, the
      Borrower shall use the full amount of such sums, after payment of any
      out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Borrower in connection therewith,
      to pay (i) first, any outstanding principal amount of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness, and (ii) second, any outstanding principal amount of the
      Indebtedness under this Agreement; provided, however, that, with the prior
      written approval of Nationwide (which it may elect to grant or withheld in
      its sole discretion), the Borrower may apply all of such sums to prepay
      the principal Indebtedness outstanding hereunder until paid in full, in
      which event all such excess shall be applied in reduction of the principal
      balance of the Nationwide Indebtedness; provided, further, that, if at the
      time of the Borrower's receipt of any of the aforesaid sums, there is no
      amount then outstanding hereunder or less than the full amount has been
      drawn hereunder, the Borrower shall utilize such sums to prepay other
      Indebtedness (or distribute such sums to its sole Member for such use) or
      the Nationwide Indebtedness and, to the extent that such sums are applied
      in reduction of the principal of such other Indebtedness (or so used by
      such Member), the Commitment hereunder shall be reduced dollar for dollar.

            (c) If the Acquisition Cost (as defined in the Lease Agreement) is
      reduced by the Acquisition Cost Adjustment (as defined in the Lease
      Agreement) as a result of the termination of the Sub-Management Agreement,
      then (i) the Commitment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the lesser
      of the Acquisition Cost Adjustment and the unused Commitment and (ii) if
      the amount of the reduction under Section 2.6(c)(i) is less than the
      Acquisition Cost Adjustment, then (A) the Borrower, within 30 days after
      the date the adjustment for the Acquisition Cost Adjustment is made under
      the Lease Agreement, shall pay an amount equal to the excess of the
      Acquisition Cost Adjustment over the amount of the reduction in the
      Commitment under Section 2.6(c)(i) to be applied to (I) first, any
      outstanding principal amount of the Nationwide Indebtedness, and (II)
      second, any


                                       13
<PAGE>

      outstanding principal amount of the Indebtedness under this Agreement;
      provided, however, that, with the prior written approval of Nationwide
      (which it may elect to grant or withheld in its sole discretion), the
      Borrower may apply all of such sums to prepay the principal Indebtedness
      outstanding hereunder until paid in full, in which event all such excess
      shall be applied in reduction of the principal balance of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness, and (B) the Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of
      Loans as so prepaid.

      2.7 Note. The Loans shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the
order of the Lender. The amount of each Loan and repayment or prepayment of the
principal thereof shall be endorsed by the Lender on the schedule annexed to and
constituting a part of the Note, provided that the failure to make or any error
in making any such endorsement on such schedule shall not limit or extinguish
the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan. Such endorsements shall be
prima facie evidence of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made
by the Lender.

      2.8 Other Indebtedness. Any amount paid by the Lender or an Affiliate of
the Lender to Nationwide under the Intercreditor Agreement, or to any other
lender to Borrower under a similar agreement entered into pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 7.3, shall be deemed a borrowing by the Borrower and a part
of the Loans.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  PAYMENTS; REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT; EXTENSION

      3.1 Manner of Payments. Each payment required to be made by the Borrower
under this Agreement and the Note, if any, shall be made by transferring the
amount thereof in immediately available funds in Dollars to the Payment Account,
no later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date on which such payment
shall become due. Each such payment shall be made without set-off or
counterclaim; provided that no payment by the Borrower to the Lender pursuant to
this Section 3.1 shall be deemed a waiver of any rights the Borrower may have
against the Lender. Subject to Section 11.16 hereof, each such payment shall
also be made free and clear of, and without deduction for, any taxes, duties,
levies, imposts or other charges of a similar nature except as required by law
and, in the event that any deduction for any taxes, duties, levies, imposts or
other charges shall be so required, the Borrower shall pay such additional
amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount of the payment hereunder,
after reduction by the amount of such taxes, duties, levies, imposts or other
charges, is equal to the amount that the Borrower was obligated to pay absent
the requirement to deduct such taxes, duties, levies, imposts or other charges.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing sentence or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall the Borrower be obligated or
responsible for taxes on the overall net income or overall gross receipts of the
Lender or franchise taxes of the Lender. Any payment received after 3:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been received
on the next following Business Day. All payments received by the Lender shall be
applied first to outstanding Obligations other


                                       14
<PAGE>

than principal, interest and late charges, then to accrued but unpaid late
charges, then to accrued but unpaid interest, and then to unpaid principal.

      3.2 Extension of Payments. If any payment by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date
thereof shall be extended to the next following day which is a Business Day, and
such extension shall be taken into account in computing the amount of interest
then due and payable hereunder.

      3.3 Computation of Interest. Interest on all Loans payable under this
Agreement and the Note shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
consisting of 12 months of 30 days each.

      3.4 Reduction of Commitment. The Borrower may, upon not less than three
Business Days' irrevocable notice (or such shorter period as is provided in
Section 2.2(d)), reduce all but not less than all of the unused Commitment to
zero. In addition, if the Borrower shall give a Notice of Borrowing but fails to
satisfy the conditions to the Loan requested thereby on the date for making of
such Loan, other than as provided in the proviso to Section 4.1(i), the
Commitment shall be reduced to an amount of the outstanding Loans, if any,
effective as of the date such Loan was to have been made. The Borrower may not
otherwise reduce the Commitment. At 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the one
hundred eightieth (180) day following the Termination Date, unless the
Commitment Period is extended pursuant to a written notice delivered to the
Borrower by the Lender, the Commitment shall be reduced to zero; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not affect the Borrower's rights with respect
to any unfunded advance theretofore requested by the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE IV

which would not have required consent of the Lender under Section 2.10(c) of the

date of this Agreement.

      4.2 Continuing Conditions. The agreement of the Lender to make each Loan
requested to be made by it on any date (including the initial Loan) is subject
to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

      and

            (d) UCC, etc., Searches. The Lender shall have received an updated

<PAGE>

      reduced, but the balance thereof made available to the Borrower, as
      described in the proviso thereto).

            (e) Cotter/Forman Guaranty. If such Loan is being made on or before
      the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date as a result of a
      Mandatory Borrowing or Reduction Notice and, in such Mandatory Borrowing
      Notice, the Lender states that (i) it will obtain all or a part of the
      funds for such Loan by the Lender or an Affiliate, or any of them (such
      party or party being the "Citadel Borrower"), borrowing funds from a
      person or persons other than an Affiliate of the Lender (the "Third Party
      Lender") and (ii) it requests delivery of the guaranty provided for in
      this Section 4.2(e), the Third Party Lender shall have received a guaranty
      by James J. Cotter and Michael R. Forman, jointly and severally, of the
      obligations of the Citadel Borrower to the Third Party Lender, in such
      form and containing such terms as such Third Party Lender may reasonably
      request (and, without limiting the foregoing, the Lender may assign or
      grant a security interest in the Note and the Pledge Agreement and
      Security Agreement, or any of them, to any Third Party Lender); provided,
      that (v) such guaranty shall be on customary terms for similar guaranties
      and shall provide that it shall terminate on, and be of no effect with
      respect to any claim made thereon after, the seventh (7th) anniversary of
      the Closing Date, (w) Messrs. Cotter and Forman shall not be required to
      provide such guaranty unless, simultaneously therewith, the Lender
      provides to them an indemnity agreement, in form reasonably satisfactory
      to them, pursuant to which the Lender agrees to indemnify such guarantors
      against any liability (including reasonable attorneys fees and other
      costs) they may incur by reason of such guaranty, (x) Messrs. Cotter and
      Forman shall have no obligation to provide any security or collateral for
      such guaranty, (y) Messrs. Cotter and Forman shall have no obligation to
      provide such guaranty (A) unless the loan obtained by the Citadel Borrower
      is obtained solely for the purpose of providing funds to make Loans under
      this Agreement or (B) if any collateral is provided for such loan other
      than any one or more of the Note, the Pledge Agreement, the Security
      Agreement, the Lease Agreement, the License of Intangibles, those certain
      management agreements assigned to the Lender or an Affiliate by the
      Borrower or entered into between the Lender or an Affiliate, on the one
      hand, and the Borrower or an Affiliate, on the other, the other assets and
      contract rights obtained or entered into by the Lender and its Affiliates
      in connection with the foregoing, and the other assets, contract rights,
      and other intangibles obtained by the Lender and its Affiliates in
      connection with the leasing or operation of the Theatre Properties and the
      management of the theatres managed under the management agreements
      referred to in this clause (B) and (z) the Lender shall pay or reimburse
      Messrs. Cotter and Forman for all reasonable legal fees and other out of
      pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with such guaranty.

On the date of each Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented that
all of the conditions to the making of such Loan have been satisfied.

      4.3 No Waiver of Conditions. If any one or more of the foregoing
conditions set forth in Section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof are not satisfied at the time
when a Loan is to be advanced by the Lender


                                       18
<PAGE>

and the Lender nevertheless (whether with or without knowledge of the failure of
any such condition to be satisfied) funds the then pending Loan to the Borrower,
the making of such Loan shall not operate as a waiver of any such condition.

                                    ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

lease its properties and conduct its business as presently conducted and to

copies of the Borrower's certificate of formation and Limited Liability Company

      Affiliates or, as of the date of this Agreement, any other Person (other
      than Lender or any of its Affiliates) that, if adversely determined
      against the Borrower, could be reasonably expected to question the
      validity of this Agreement or any of the other Related Documents to which
      it is (or may become) a party or the Liens purported to be created
      thereby.

performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the other Related Documents to
which it is (or may become) a party will not (a) as of the date hereof or the

of, or constitute a default under, any terms or provisions of any material
Contract to which the Borrower is a party or to which it or any material portion
of its Assets is subject (including its interest in the Site Leases and the
Option Agreement) or any Applicable Law (provided compliance with such Contract
or Applicable Law is not the obligation of Citadel Cinemas or any of its
Affiliates under the Operational Agreements), or the Borrower's certificate of
formation or Limited Liability Company Agreement or (b) result in, or require
the creation or imposition of, any Lien upon or with respect to the Assets
except as may be contemplated hereby or by the Related Documents, which, in the
case of this clause (b) would have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Adverse Effect.

      5.9 Pension Plans. The Borrower has not established and does not maintain
or contribute to any employee benefit plan that is covered by Title IV of ERISA.

      5.10 Collateral. Once executed and delivered, the terms of the Pledge
Agreement shall create a valid security interest in the Equity Collateral,
securing the payment of the Obligations. Once executed and delivered, the terms
of the Security Agreement shall create a valid security interest in all material
elements of the Borrower Collateral (taken as a whole), securing payment of the

<PAGE>

Effect, (c) any material adverse change in the condition or operations of the

      the Borrower for such year, setting forth in each (other than its first)
      fiscal year in comparative form the figures for the previous year;

and shall correct any known misunderstanding as to its separate identity.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                               NEGATIVE COVENANTS

      The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that from the date hereof until
the Obligations have been paid and performed in full and this Agreement shall
have terminated, unless the Lender shall otherwise consent in writing:

      7.1 Change in Nature of Business. The Borrower will not (a) enter into any
business other than the business contemplated by the Lease Agreement or (b)
become subject to or a party to any Contract, without the written consent of the
Lender, other than this Agreement, the other Related Documents to which the

its obligations under the Operational Agreements and this Agreement, and
extensions, renewals and replacements of the Nationwide Indebtedness, the other
Indebtedness listed on Schedule 5.17 hereto and Indebtedness arising or

      7.2 Liens. The Borrower will not create, incur, assume or permit to exist
any Lien on any of its Assets or any portion thereof, whether now owned or

and the other Related Documents; (b) existing Liens, and other matters affecting
title, listed on Schedule 7.2 hereto; (c) Liens for Taxes and governmental
charges and levies not delinquent, which are being Properly Contested or which
are the obligation of Citadel Cinemas or any of its Affiliates to pay pursuant
to the Operational Agreements; (d) mechanics', workers', materialmen's,
warehousemen's, operators', carriers', or other like Liens arising in the
ordinary and normal course of business with respect to obligations which are not

<PAGE>

(g) extensions, renewals and replacements of Liens described in paragraph (b)
hereof, provided that such extension, renewal or replacement Lien is limited to
the property covered by the Lien so extended, renewed or replaced and does not
secure any Indebtedness or amount that is in excess of that secured immediately
prior to such extension or renewal; (h) easements, rights-of-way, restrictions,
imperfections in title, liens, charges and other encumbrances on owned or leased
real property, landlord's and lessor's Liens under any of the Site Leases,
restrictions under federal and state securities laws on the transfer of
securities and other restrictions not securing Indebtedness that are incurred in
the ordinary and normal course of business, all of which (other than landlord's
or lessor's Liens under the Site Leases), in the aggregate, are not substantial
in amount and which do not in any case materially detract from the value of the
property subject thereto or will not have a Material Adverse Effect; (i) Liens
created by the Nationwide Agreement (subject to Section 7.3 hereof) or Liens to
secure Indebtedness permitted to exist pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof; (j) Liens
not created by the Borrower, Citadel Cinemas or any of its Affiliates which are
being Properly Contested; and (k) Liens placed on the Assets of the Borrower by,
or arising from, a Tenant Event, whether or not such Liens are permitted to
exist pursuant to the terms of the Operational Agreements; provided, however,
that the fact that a Lien described in any of foregoing clauses other than
clause (k) above is a Permitted Lien for purposes of this Agreement does not
affect Citadel Cinemas' rights or the Borrower's obligations as landlord
pursuant to the Lease Agreement if Citadel Cinemas properly exercises its
Purchase Option thereunder; provided, further, however, that the Liens described
in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) shall only constitute Permitted Liens in the
event that Citadel Cinemas or any of its Affiliates either has requested that
the Borrower allow such Liens to be incurred or permitted to exist on the
Borrower's Assets or has failed to perform any obligation under any of the
Operational Agreements and as a result thereof, the Borrower, in its reasonable
discretion, creates, incurs, assumes or permits to exist such Liens.

however, that the Borrower may only incur or permit to exist such extensions,
renewals, or replacements, or any Indebtedness described in clause (b) or (d)
which is secured by a Lien on any material Assets of the Borrower, if each
lender of any portion of such Indebtedness (excluding for this purpose
Nationwide and the Lender and any of its Affiliates) shall have executed and
delivered agreements (x) with Citadel Cinemas and Fee Sub which in Citadel
Cinemas' reasonable judgment will assure to Citadel Cinemas its rights under the
Lease Agreement (including the Purchase Option), absent the existence of an
Event of Default by Citadel Cinemas under the Lease Agreement, and assure to Fee
Sub its rights under the Fee Option Agreement and (y) in the case of such
Indebtedness referred to in clause (b) only, with the Lender, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender, providing to the Lender
substantially the same rights as the Lender has under Sections 2.02(e), 2.03,
2.08(b), 2.10(c), 2.11(g), 2.11(h)(i), 2.11(h)(iii), 2.12 and 2.13 of the
Intercreditor Agreement (except that the Borrower shall have complied with its
obligation


                                       26

in respect of this clause (y) to obtain an agreement of such other lender as
aforesaid if such other lender has offered to enter into such an agreement
provided the Lender hereunder agrees in such agreement to provisions in favor of
such other lender similar to those set forth in Sections 2.02(e), 2.12 and
2.13(a) of the Intercreditor Agreement and, if such other lender is then
providing financing to replace the Nationwide Indebtedness, Sections 2.02(a),
(b) and (d), 2.04, 2.09(a), 2.10(b) and 2.11(f) thereof). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in no event will the Borrower create, assume,
incur or permit to exist or otherwise become or remain liable in respect of any
Indebtedness if, as a result thereof, (x) the outstanding principal amount of
such Indebtedness under the Nationwide Agreement would exceed eleven million
Dollars ($11,000,000), or (y) the total outstanding principal amount of such
Indebtedness, including the Indebtedness under this Agreement, would exceed
twenty nine million Dollars ($29,000,000) less any reductions made to the
Acquisition Cost under the Lease (subject to the provisions of Section 2.6(c) as
to the time period within which to reduce such Indebtedness if there is any

of record any of the membership interests of the Borrower without the prior
written consent of the Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Borrower will not, during the shorter of the four year period
commencing on the date hereof or the period from the date hereof until James J.

      7.12 Dividends. The Borrower will not declare or pay any dividend in
respect of, or make any distribution in respect of, or redemption or purchase
of, any of its membership interests; provided, however, that so long as no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, the
Borrower may make distributions or returns of capital to its Member in respect
of any fiscal quarter of the Borrower, provided that the aggregate amount of
distributions so paid would not render the Borrower insolvent within the meaning
of Section 101(32) (A) of the Bankruptcy Code, provided, however, that a "fair
valuation" (as defined in that Section) of the Assets (less cash held by the
Borrower) shall in no event be valued at less than $32,500,000.

      7.13 Prohibition of Amendments or Waivers. The Borrower will not amend,
alter, modify, or waive, or consent to any amendment, alteration, modification
or waiver of: the Borrower's certificate of formation, the Limited Liability
Company Agreement, any Site Lease or the Option Agreement, except to effect
administrative changes that could not adversely affect the interests of the
Lender or Citadel Cinemas or, in the case of Site Lease or the Option Agreement,
are incidental to performance of its obligations under the Operational
Agreements, provided that the Borrower shall provide written notice to the
Lender of any such change promptly, and in any event not more than five (5)
Business Days after such change is effective; or any Contract (including those
referred to above) if such amendment, alteration, modification or waiver might
have a Material Adverse Effect.

      7.14 Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not create or acquire any
Subsidiaries.

described in and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

      maturity, mandatory prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, or (ii) any
      installment of interest or any other amount payable to the Lender
      hereunder or under any other Related Document to which the Borrower is a
      party within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice from the
      Lender that the payment thereof is due; provided, however, that no such
      failure described in clause (i) or (ii) shall constitute an Event of
      Default hereunder for any purpose to the extent arising from (x) a failure
      by Citadel Cinemas to pay any amount of Basic Rent or Additional Rent
      (each as defined in the Lease Agreement) as and when due thereunder or (y)
      the use by the Borrower of such cash or cash equivalents or other

      when made or delivered unless each of the following conditions shall
      exist: (i) such representation or warranty is of a nature that it is
      capable of being cured within thirty (30) days after written notice shall
      have been given to the Borrower by the Lender specifying the falsity or
      inaccuracy of such representation or warranty, (ii) the Borrower shall
      have given such notice promptly after having obtained Actual Knowledge of
      such falsity or inaccuracy, (iii) the Borrower shall have diligently
      commenced curing such default and is proceeding diligently and in good

      or Article VII hereof, provided, however, in the event such default occurs
      prior to the commencement of the Commitment Period (or, if earlier, the
      making of a Loan), such default shall not constitute an Event of Default

      notice from the Lender; or

            (d) Default on the part of the Borrower in the due performance or
      observance of any other covenant or obligation of the Borrower contained

      shall have proceeded diligently and in good faith to complete curing such
      default, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended to one hundred

      of sixty (60) consecutive days; or

                  (ii) The commencement by the Borrower of a voluntary case

      however, that, if any of the events described in clauses (i) and (ii) of
      this paragraph (e) shall arise as a result of a Tenant Event, such event
      shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes hereof; or

            (f) Any of the Equity Collateral or any material portion of the
      Borrower Collateral (taken as a whole) shall be attached for execution or
      become subject to the order of any court or any other process for
      execution and attachment and such attachment, order or process shall
      remain in effect and undischarged for sixty (60) consecutive days and is
      not related to or does not arise from or by reason of a Tenant Event; or

            (h)   (i) The Borrower shall default in the payment when due of any
      principal of or premium (if any) or interest on any Nationwide
      Indebtedness and such default shall continue beyond any applicable grace
      period, or shall fail to observe or perform any terms of any instrument
      pursuant to which any such Nationwide Indebtedness was created or of any
      mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating thereto if the effect of
      such failure is to cause the acceleration of such Indebtedness, or permit
      Nationwide to accelerate the maturity thereof, and such Nationwide failure
      shall not have been waived in writing pursuant thereto; or

                  (ii) The Borrower shall default in the payment when due of any
      principal of or premium (if any) or interest on any other Indebtedness and

      fail to observe or perform any terms of any instrument pursuant to which
      any such other Indebtedness was created or of any mortgage, indenture or
      other agreement relating thereto if the effect of such failure is to cause
      the acceleration of such Indebtedness and such failure shall not have been
      waived pursuant thereto; provided, however, that no such failure to pay by
      the Borrower shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder to the extent
      arising from (x) a failure by Citadel Cinemas to pay any amount of Basic
      Rent or Additional Rent as and when due pursuant to the Lease Agreement or
      (y) the use by the Borrower of such cash or cash equivalents or other
      reasonably liquid assets to perform any obligations which Citadel Cinemas
      has failed to perform under any of the Operational Agreements; or

            (i) The representation contained in Section 5.10 hereof shall at any
      time become untrue as relates to the Equity Collateral or any material
      element or portion of the Borrower Collateral (taken as a whole) and the
      Borrower fails to cure such condition within ten (10) days after written
      notice by the Lender that such a condition exists; or

            (j)   (i) Any Related Document shall, for any reason, be declared to
      be null and void or shall not give or shall cease to give the Lender the
      Liens or the material rights, powers and privileges purported to be
      created thereby in favor of the Lender as relates to the Equity
      Collateral, or to any material element or portion of the Borrower
      Collateral (taken as a whole), superior to and prior to the rights of all
      third Persons and subject to no other Liens (except to the extent
      expressly permitted herein or therein), provided, however, if any of the
      events described in this clause (i) of this paragraph (k) shall arise as a
      result of a Tenant Event, such an event shall not constitute an Event of
      Default hereunder, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of the Liens
      granted, to be granted, or purported to be granted, by this Agreement or
      the other Related Documents shall be contested by the Borrower or any of
      its Affiliates; or

            (k) Any Site Lease or the Option Agreement shall be declared to be
      null and void or shall not give or shall cease to give the Borrower the
      material rights, powers and privileges purported to be created thereby,
      solely as a result of any action or inaction by the Borrower or an event
      or condition relating solely to the Borrower; or

            (l) The Lease Agreement shall be declared to be null and void or
      shall not give or shall cease to give Citadel Cinemas the material rights,
      powers and privileges purported to be created thereby, solely as a result
      of any action or inaction by the Borrower or any event or condition
      relating solely to Borrower; or

            (m) Any material representation or warranty made by either Indemnity
      Guarantor in his Indemnity Guarantee proves to be false or inaccurate in
      any material respect; or

            (n)   (i) The Indemnity Guarantee ceases to be in full force and
      effect; or

                  (ii) A default occurs and continues after the expiration of
      any applicable grace period under the Indemnity Guarantee such that the
      ability of the Lender to realize thereon is materially compromised.

      9.2 Default Remedies. (a) If any Event of Default (other than Events of
Default specified in paragraph (e) of Section 9.1 hereof) shall occur and be
continuing, then and in every such event, and at any time thereafter during the
continuance of such Event of Default, the Lender may by written notice to the
Borrower declare the Obligations to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon (i)
the Commitment shall immediately reduce to zero and (ii) the Obligations shall
become forthwith due and payable both as to principal and interest together with
all other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement which may be due
or accrued and unpaid, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice
of any kind, all of which are expressly waived. Notwithstanding anything in the
preceding sentence to the contrary, if an Event of Default occurs priors to the
advance of the initial Loan and the Lender elects to reduce the Commitment to
zero, then if the Borrower cures such Event of Default before the Termination
Date, the rights of the parties hereto shall be reinstated as if the Event of
Default never occurred.

      (b) In addition, if an Event of Default occurs following the date of the
initial Loan but prior to the Termination Date, then if the Borrower cures such
Event of Default prior to the earlier of (i) the completion of the sale of any
Collateral pursuant to the Pledge Agreement or the Security Agreement and (ii)
the Termination Date, then the rights of the parties hereto shall be reinstated
as if the Event of Default never occurred, provided that the Borrower has made
good any missed payments.

      (c) If an Event of Default set forth in paragraph (e) of Section 9.1
hereof shall occur with respect to the Borrower, then without any notice to the
Borrower or any other act by the Lender or any other Person (i) the Commitment
shall be immediately reduced to zero, and (ii) the Obligations shall become
forthwith due and payable, all without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived.

      (d) If the Lender shall declare the Obligations to be forthwith due and
payable pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.2, the Lender may, subject in
all cases to the terms of the Intercreditor


                                       32

Agreement, enforce its rights hereunder and under any other instrument or
agreement delivered in connection herewith and take any other action to which it
is entitled hereunder, thereunder, or by law, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, in any
such instrument or agreement or to enforce payment as provided herein, therein,
or by law, and, in such event, the Lender shall be entitled to receive from the
Borrower, in addition to all other amounts provided for herein, all costs,
expenses and fees reasonably incurred by the Lender, including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements.

      (e) The Lender shall endeavor to give the Borrower notice within 30 days
of the Lender becoming aware of any Event or Default (or event which, with
notice or passage of time or both, would become an Event of Default), provided
that (i) if Lender fails to give such notice within five Business Days of
obtaining knowledge of such default (which shall not include knowledge of James
J. Cotter), and Borrower does not otherwise have knowledge of such default on or
before such fifth Business Day, then any period provided herein for Borrower to
cure such default shall be extended by the number of days in the period from
such fifth Business day to the date on which Borrower obtains Actual Knowledge
of such default (whether by notice from Lender or otherwise) and (ii) failure to
give such notice shall not act as a waiver of or prejudice any rights or
remedies of the Lender, except as specifically provided in Section 9.2(e)(i).

      9.3 Setoff. The Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
without prior notice to the Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set-off and apply any and all balances, credits, deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final), accounts or monies at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by the Lender or any Affiliate to or for
the account of the Borrower against any and all of the amounts owing by the
Borrower under this Agreement or the Related Documents to which it is a party,
whether or not the Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder;
provided, however, that no setoff will be made by any Affiliate of the Lender
unless and until such Affiliate has provided not less than five (5) Business
Days' notice to the Borrower of such anticipated action. The rights of the
Lender under this Section 9.3 are in addition to, and do not derogate from or
impair, other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights
of setoff) which the Lender may have.

      9.4 Default Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, so long as an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing (after, as well as before judgment), but with regard to Events
of Default other than pursuant to Section 9.1(a) only after notice from the
Lender electing to impose the default rate, then to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the Borrower shall from time to time pay interest to the Lender
on any amount not paid within five (5) days after demand from the date such
payment became due until payment in full at a rate equal to the sum of the rate
of interest payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof plus 1.5% per
annum.

      9.5 Restrictions on Remedies. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement, including in Article IX hereof, the rights of the Lender hereunder
shall be subject in all cases to the limitations imposed by the Intercreditor
Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                   COLLATERAL

      10.1 Borrower Collateral. In order to secure the due payment and
performance by the Borrower of all of the Obligations of the Borrower to the
Lender, the Borrower shall grant to the Lender a Lien on all of the Borrower
Collateral by the execution and delivery to the Lender of the Security
Agreement.

      10.2 Equity Collateral. In order to secure the Obligations, Sutton Hill
shall grant to the Lender a Lien on the Equity Collateral, by the execution and
delivery of the Pledge Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

      11.1 Modification of Agreement; No Sale of Interest. Any provision of this
Agreement or any other Related Document may be modified, altered, amended or
waived if, but only if, such modification, alteration, amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Lender. The Lender may assign,
grant or sell any participation, interest, obligation or right in or to this
Agreement or any other Related Document, or any portion hereof or thereof, to
any Person without the prior written consent of the Borrower; provided, however,
that no such assignment, grant, or sale shall relieve the assigning Lender of
its obligations to lend (before or after such assignment) or of any other
obligations hereunder theretofore accruing; and, provided, further, that the
Lender may grant participations to Affiliates so long as the Lender's
obligations to the Borrower hereunder are not affected thereby.

      11.2 Indulgences Not Waivers. The Lender's failure, at any time or times
hereafter, to require strict performance by the Borrower of any provision of
this Agreement or the other Related Documents shall not waive, affect or
diminish any right of the Lender thereafter to demand strict compliance and
performance therewith. Any suspension or waiver by the Lender of an Event of
Default by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Related Documents
shall not suspend, waive or affect any other Event of Default by the Borrower
under this Agreement or the other Related Documents, whether the same is prior
or subsequent thereto and whether of the same or of a different type. None of
the undertakings, agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of the
Borrower contained in this Agreement or the other Related Documents and no Event
of Default by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Related Documents
shall be deemed to have been suspended or waived by the Lender, unless such
suspension or waiver is by an instrument in writing


                                       34
<PAGE>

specifying such suspension or waiver and is signed by a duly authorized
representative of the Lender and directed to the Borrower.

      11.3 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

      11.4 Cumulative Rights; No Waiver. The rights, powers and remedies of the
Lender hereunder are cumulative and in addition to all rights, powers and
remedies provided under any and all agreements between the Borrower and the
Lender relating hereto, at law, in equity or otherwise. Neither any delay nor
any omission by the Lender to exercise any right, power or remedy shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

      11.5 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts,
each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the
same Agreement.

      11.6 Notices. All notices, offers, acceptances, approvals, waivers,
requests, demands and other communications hereunder or under any other Related
Document shall be in writing, shall be addressed as provided below and shall be
considered as properly given (a) if delivered in person, (b) if sent by express

telecopy, the sender shall in addition confirm such notice by writing sent in
the manner specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 11.6. All notices
shall be effective upon receipt by the addressee; provided, however, that if any
notice is tendered to an addressee and the delivery thereof is refused by such
addressee, such notice shall be effective upon such tender. For the purposes of
notice, the addresses of the parties shall be as set forth below; provided,
however, that any party shall have the right to change its address for notice
hereunder to any other location by giving written notice to the other party in

EXPRESSLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ENFORCING OR DEFENDING ANY RIGHTS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.9 HAVE BEEN BARGAINED FOR
AND THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

      11.10 General Waivers. The Borrower waives (a) presentment, demand and
protest and notice of presentment, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity,
release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any Indebtedness at any

Collateral or any bond or security which might be required by any court prior to
allowing the Lender to exercise any of the Lender's remedies, including the

acceptance hereof. Each party hereto waives the right to interpose counterclaims
(other than mandatory counterclaims) of any kind or description in any

provided that the foregoing shall not limit set-off rights any party may have.

      11.11 Limited Recourse. Except to the extent of, and under the
circumstances specifically provided for in, Section 5 of the Pledge Agreement,
no recourse for the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or
any other amount due under this Agreement or any Related Document, or for any

future, of any such direct or indirect member, it being understood that the

remedies against the Borrower or its Assets, or any other Person expressly
undertaking in writing obligations in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

<PAGE>

date specified by the Borrower for termination (a) there shall not be any Loans
then Outstanding and (b) all amounts then due and payable to the Lender under
this Agreement or the other Related Documents shall have been paid in full. No
termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, shall affect the obligations
and liabilities of the Borrower hereunder which arose prior to such termination
or the Lender's rights, powers and remedies with respect thereto.

Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) will deliver to the Borrower
a fully completed and duly executed copy of the United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 4224 or Form 1001 confirming that such Lender is entitled under
Section 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code or any other applicable provision
thereof or under any applicable tax treaty or convention to receive payments
under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax. So long as the Loans are Outstanding and until the Obligations have
been paid and performed in full, the Lender shall also deliver a further copy of
such Form 4224 or Form 1001 or any successor forms thereto to the Borrower upon
expiration of the form previously delivered by the Lender hereunder, unless any
change in law or regulation of the United States or any taxing authority thereof
has occurred prior to the date on which such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders such form inapplicable or which would prevent the Lender
from completing and delivering such form. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be required to gross-up any
payment for withholding taxes imposed on the Lender which has failed to comply
with its obligations under this Section 11.16 if such compliance would have
avoided such withholding taxes.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                               LENDER COOPERATION

elects not to draw down, the entire Commitment hereunder, the Lender shall, to
the extent reasonably requested by the Borrower and subject to the terms and
conditions herein, and at the Borrower's cost and expense, cooperate to allow
the Borrower to refinance its Indebtedness existing on the date hereof with any
other Person, including at any time and from time to time, upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower, and at the Borrower's cost and expense, to execute and
deliver any and all such further instruments and documents as the Borrower may
reasonably request in order to carry out such refinancing, provided that such
financing otherwise complies with the terms of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 hereof.

      Sutton Hill Capital, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company (the
"Borrower"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the order of READING
INTERNATIONAL, INC. (the "Lender") the principal amount of EIGHTEEN MILLION
DOLLARS ($18,000,000) or, if less, the unpaid principal amount of the Lender's
Loans outstanding under the Citadel Standby Credit Facility dated as of July 28,
2000 between the Borrower and the Lender, as amended and restated as of January
29, 2002 (as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented
or extended, the "Credit Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein have the
meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. The principal amount of each
Loan shall be due and payable as provided in the Credit Agreement. The Borrower
also promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof from time to
time outstanding, at such interest rates and on such dates as are determined
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. All such principal and interest shall be
payable in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available
funds at the office of the Lender as provided in the Credit Agreement.

      The date and amount of each Loan and each repayment and prepayment of
principal thereof shall be endorsed by the Lender on the schedule attached
hereto, or on a continuation of such schedule attached to and made a part
hereof, provided that the failure to make or any error in making any such
endorsement on such schedule shall not limit, extinguish or in any way modify
the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Lender's Loans strictly in
accordance with the Credit Agreement.

      This Note is the Note referred to in the Credit Agreement and is entitled
to the benefits thereof. This Note is subject to prepayment and its maturity is
subject to acceleration upon the terms provided in the Credit Agreement.

      The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
kind in connection with this Note.

      All indebtedness arising under this Note and all interest payable
hereunder shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Nationwide
Indebtedness now or hereafter owing,

      cause such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding to be terminated or
      otherwise to be resolved as promptly as practicable and in a manner such
      that the applicable transaction can be consummated in accordance with its
      terms. All times referred to in Section 5(d) hereof shall be determined

            d) In the event the Pledgor does not timely perform any of the
      obligations set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 5, the
      Pledgee may, after written demand to perform has been served upon the
      Pledgor and the Pledgor has been given 15 days to perform, perform said
      obligations at the Pledgor's sole cost and expense; provided, however,
      that the Pledgee shall not exercise its option to perform said obligations
      for up to 90 days if within said 15-day period the Pledgor has commenced
      to perform the obligation or obligations in question and thereafter to the
      reasonable satisfaction of the Pledgee continues to perform such
      obligation or obligations with reasonable diligence. The Pledgor shall,
      upon written demand from the Pledgee, reimburse the Pledgee for all costs,
      including reasonable attorney's fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and all
      liabilities incurred by the Pledgee by reason of the foregoing set forth
      in this Section 5, with interest thereon at the rate of eleven and one
      quarter percent (11.25%) per annum.

            e) The obligations of the Pledgor under this Section 5 hereof and
      with respect to the Nationwide Accrued Interest shall be unlimited, with
      full recourse to all of the assets of the Pledgor and its partners. The
      Pledgor and its partners agree not to request or permit, in any Insolvency
      or Liquidation Proceeding of the Pledgor, (i) any plan of reorganization,
      or confirmation order with respect thereto, which would include a
      provision that would discharge the partners of Pledgor from their
      obligations to Pledgee under this Section 5 or (ii) any party in interest
      to obtain an injunction that would enjoin or limit the Pledgee's rights
      against the partners of the Pledgee or their assets.

      SECTION 6. Remedies. (a) Subject in all cases to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and an
acceleration of the Loans, the Pledgee may, in its sole discretion, exercise
with respect to the Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies
provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of
a secured party under the New York Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable
law, and the Pledgee may also, upon reasonable notice as specified below, sell
the Collateral at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at
any of the Pledgee's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
delivery, and at such price and upon such other terms as the Pledgee may in good
faith deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgee or any of its Affiliates may be
the purchaser of the Collateral at any such sale and shall be entitled, for the
purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for
the Collateral, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account
of the purchase price of the Collateral payable by such Person at such sale.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall acquire the property sold absolutely free
from any claim or right on the part of the Pledgor, and the Pledgor hereby
waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay
and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under
any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Pledgor agrees
that at least fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of
any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
constitute reasonable notice. The Pledgee will not be obligated to make any sale
regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Pledgee may adjourn any
public or private sale from time to time by announcement of the time and place
fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time
and place to which it was adjourned. The Pledgor


                                       10
<PAGE>

hereby waives any claims against the Pledgee arising by reason of the fact that
the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such private sale was
less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the
Pledgee accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to
more than one offeree.

      (b) The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral under subsection (a) above
shall be applied in the following manner:

                  i. FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses reasonably
            incurred in connection with the sale, collection or other
            realization, including reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the
            Pledgee and its agents and counsel, all other reasonable expenses,
            liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Pledgee in
            connection therewith;

                  ii. SECOND, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Nationwide Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

                  iii. THIRD, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Obligations; and

                  iv. FOURTH, the balance, if any, shall be paid to the Pledgor
            or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as
            a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If the Pledgee or any of its Affiliates is the successful bidder at such sale,
the amount owing to Nationwide must be paid in cash.

      (c) The Pledgee has the right to enforce any and all remedies provided in
this Agreement, successively and concurrently, and such action will not operate
to estop or prevent the Pledgee from pursuing any other remedy which the Pledgee
may have at law or in equity or under any other document.

      (d) THE PLEDGOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY PRIVATE SALE OF THE COLLATERAL MAY
RESULT IN PRICES AND OTHER TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THE PLEDGOR THAN IF SUCH SALE
WERE A PUBLIC SALE AND THE PLEDGOR AGREES THAT ANY SUCH PRIVATE SALE SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MANNER.

      SECTION 7. Pledgee Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.

      Subject in all cases to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default which is not waived
by the Pledgee and following an acceleration of the Loans, the Pledgor hereby
irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Pledgee or any of its officers
or designees its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in


                                       11
<PAGE>

the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or otherwise,
from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event
of Default which is not waived by the Pledgee and following an acceleration of
the Loans, to take any action, to execute any instruments and to exercise any
rights, privileges, elections or power of the Pledgor pertaining or relating to
the Collateral which the Pledgee may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
preserve and enforce its security interest in the Collateral and otherwise to
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

      SECTION 8. Pledgee May Perform. If the Pledgor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein other than any agreement set forth in Section 5
hereof, the Pledgee may (but shall not be obligated to) itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement; provided, however, that the Pledgee shall first
have provided to the Pledgor five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of the
Pledgee's intention so to act (except in cases of emergency when no such notice
shall be required). Any sums expended by the Pledgee pursuant to this Section 7
shall be added to the Obligations and secured by the Collateral.

      SECTION 9. Amendments, etc. No amendment, waiver or modification of any
provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by the Pledgor
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
making specific reference to this Agreement and such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be consented to in one or more writings and signed
by the Pledgor, the Pledgee and Nationwide, and then such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance for the
specific purpose for which given.

      SECTION 10. Continuing Security Interest. This Agreement shall create a
continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (a) except with respect
to the provisions in Section 5 hereof, remain in full force and effect until the
later of (i) the termination of the Commitment or (ii) the payment in full of
the Obligations, (b) be binding upon the Pledgor and (c) inure to the benefit of
the Pledgee and its successors and assigns. If the Pledgee shall have instituted
any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this instrument by
foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Pledgee, then and in every such case, the Pledgor and the Pledgee shall
be restored to their respective former positions and rights hereunder with
respect to the Collateral, and all right, remedies and powers of the Pledgee
shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.

      SECTION 11. Notices. All notices, offers, acceptances, approvals, waivers,
requests, demands and other communication hereunder or under any other Related
Document shall be in writing, shall be addressed as provided below and shall be
considered as properly given (a) if delivered in person, (b) if sent by express

if sent by telecopy and confirmed; provided, that in the case of a notice by
telecopy, the sender shall in addition confirm such notice by writing sent in
the manner specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 10. All notices
shall be effective upon receipt by the addressee; provided, however, that if any
notice is tendered to an addressee and the delivery thereof is refused by such
addressee, such notice shall be


                                       12

pursuant to the Nationwide Security Agreement as and to the extent provided in
the Intercreditor Agreement) in, and a lien upon, all of the Grantor's right,
title and interest in the following property now owned or at any time hereafter
acquired by the Grantor, or in which the Grantor may acquire any right, title or
interest, as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and
performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the Obligations (collectively, the "Collateral"):

            a) all of the Grantor's right, title and interest, whether now owned
      or hereafter acquired, in and to all Equipment, wherever located, now or
      hereafter existing, together with any manufacturers' warranties with
      respect to the foregoing;

            b) all Accounts;

            c) all General Intangibles;

            d) any and all insurance policies, proceeds or benefits thereof
      related to the Collateral, provided that such policies do not expressly
      prohibit the grant of such security interest; and

            e) to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds of any and all
      of the foregoing.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Collateral" shall not include any general
intangibles, or other rights, arising under any contracts, licenses or other
documents as to which the grant of a security


                                       3
<PAGE>

interest would constitute a violation of a valid and enforceable restriction in
favor of a third party on such grant, unless and until any required consents
shall have been obtained. The Grantor agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such required consent with respect to any material items
of such Collateral.

      This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the
Collateral which shall remain in effect until all the Obligations, now existing
or hereafter arising, shall have been paid in full, the Commitments shall have
been terminated and the Credit Agreement and the Related Documents shall no
longer be in effect.

      SECTION 3. Representations and Warranties of Grantor. The Grantor hereby
represents and warrants to the Company that: (i) except as otherwise provided in
the Operational Agreements, no other Person owns or holds any ownership rights
in the Collateral; (ii) the execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement are not in violation of any indenture, agreement, or undertaking to
which the Grantor is a party or by which the Grantor is bound; (iii) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result in the
creation or imposition of any lien or charge on, security interest in or other
encumbrance on any of the assets of the Grantor except as contemplated by this
Agreement; (iv) the Grantor's chief executive office and the place where the
Grantor keeps its business records is 120 North Robertson Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California 90048; and (v) this Agreement will create and grant to the
Company (upon the filing of appropriate UCC-1 financing statements) a valid lien
on, and a perfected security interest in favor of the Company in, all right,
title or interest of the Grantor in or to the Collateral, subject only to the
prior lien in favor of Nationwide as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement,
Liens for Taxes and governmental charges and levies which are not delinquent,
which are being Properly Contested by or on behalf of the Grantor or which are
the obligation of Citadel Cinemas or any of its Affiliates to pay pursuant to
any of the Operational Agreements and Liens placed on the Collateral by, or
arising from, the actions or inactions of, or any event or condition relating
to, Citadel Cinemas or any of its Affiliates, whether or not such Liens are
permitted to exist pursuant to the terms of any of the Operational Agreements.

      SECTION 4. Further Assurances; Affirmative Covenants.

      The Grantor covenants and agrees that, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitment is
terminated:

            a) The Grantor will promptly execute and deliver and will cause to
      be executed and delivered all further instruments and documents,
      including, without limitation, financing and continuation statements, and
      will take all further action and will cause all further action to be
      taken, that the Company may reasonably request in order to create,
      preserve, perfect and protect the security interest in the Collateral or
      to enable the Company to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies
      hereunder or to preserve, perfect and protect the Company's right, title
      and interest in and to the Collateral.


                                       4
<PAGE>

            b) The Grantor will at all times keep accurate and complete books
      and records with respect to the Collateral and agrees that the Company or
      its representative shall have the right at any time and from time to time
      to call at the Grantor's place of business during normal business hours to
      inspect and examine the books and records of the Grantor relating to the
      Collateral and to make extracts therefrom and copies thereof.

            c) The Grantor will keep the Collateral free and clear of all
      security interests, liens and claims other than the security interest and
      lien herein granted and the security interest and lien granted to
      Nationwide or otherwise permitted to exist pursuant to the Credit
      Agreement, Liens for Taxes and governmental charges and levies which are
      not delinquent, which are being Properly Contested by or on behalf of the
      Grantor or which are the obligation of Citadel Cinemas or any of its
      Affiliates to pay pursuant to any of the Operational Agreements and Liens
      placed on the Collateral by, or arising from, the actions or inactions of,
      or any event or condition relating to, Citadel Cinemas or any of its
      Affiliates, whether or not such Liens are permitted to exist pursuant to
      the terms of any of the Operational Agreements, and will not sell, assign,
      transfer, exchange or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with
      respect to, the Collateral, except by assignment to the Company and
      Nationwide or the holder of any such other permitted lien.

            d) The Grantor will defend the Company's right, title and security
      interest in and to the Collateral against claims and demands of all
      persons whomsoever, other than Nationwide.

      SECTION 5. Remedies. Subject in all cases to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and an
acceleration of the Loans, the Company may, in its sole discretion, exercise
with respect to the Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies
provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of
a secured party under the Code or other applicable law, and the Company may
also, upon reasonable notice as specified below, sell the Collateral at public
or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at any of the Company's
offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such
price and upon such other terms as the Company may in good faith deem
commercially reasonable. The Company or any of its Affiliates may be the
purchaser of the Collateral at any such sale and shall be entitled, for the
purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for
the Collateral, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account
of the purchase price of the Collateral payable by such Person at such sale.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall acquire the property sold absolutely free
from any claim or right on the part of the Grantor, and the Grantor hereby
waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay
and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under
any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Grantor agrees
that at least fifteen (15) days' notice to the Grantor of the time and place of
any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
constitute reasonable notice. The Company will not be obligated to make any sale
regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Company may adjourn any
public or private sale from time to time by announcement of the time and place
fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time
and place to


                                       5
<PAGE>

which it was adjourned. The Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Company
arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have
been sold at such private sale was less than the price which might have been
obtained at a public sale, even if the Company accepts the first offer received
and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.

            (b) The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral under subsection (a)
      above shall be applied in the following manner:

                        (i) FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses
            reasonably incurred in connection with the sale, collection or other
            realization, including reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the
            Company and its agents and counsel, all other reasonable expenses,
            liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Company in
            connection therewith;

                        (ii) SECOND, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Nationwide Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

                        (iii) THIRD, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Obligations; and

                        (iv) FOURTH, the balance, if any, shall be paid to the
            Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
            same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

            If the Company or any of its Affiliates is the successful bidder at
such sale, the amount owing to Nationwide in respect of the Nationwide
Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) must be paid in full in
cash.

            (c) The Company has the right to enforce any and all remedies
provided in this Agreement, successively and concurrently, and such action will
not operate to estop or prevent the Company from pursuing any other remedy which
the Company may have at law or in equity or under any other document.

            (d) THE GRANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY PRIVATE SALE OF THE COLLATERAL
MAY RESULT IN PRICES AND OTHER TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THE GRANTOR THAN IF SUCH
SALE WERE A PUBLIC SALE AND THE GRANTOR AGREES THAT ANY SUCH PRIVATE SALE SHALL
BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MANNER.

      SECTION 6. Company Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Subject in all cases to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default which is not waived by the Company and
following an acceleration of the Loans, the Grantor hereby irrevocably makes,
constitutes and appoints the Company or any of its officers or designees its
true


                                       6
<PAGE>

and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the
Grantor and in the name of the Grantor or otherwise, from time to time after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default which is not
waived by the Company and following an acceleration of the Loans, to take any
action, to execute any instruments and to exercise any rights, privileges,
elections or power of the Grantor pertaining or relating to the Collateral which
the Company may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to preserve and enforce
its security interest in the Collateral and otherwise to accomplish the purposes
of this Agreement.

      SECOND 7. Company May Perform. If the Grantor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to)
itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement; provided, however, that
the Company shall first have provided to the Grantor five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice of the Company's intention so to act (except in cases of
emergency when no such notice shall be required). Any sums expended by the
Company pursuant to this Section 7 shall be added to the Obligations and secured
by the Collateral.

      SECTION 8. Amendments, etc. No amendment, waiver or modification of any
provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by the Grantor
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
making specific reference to this Agreement and such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be consented to in one or more writings and signed
by the Grantor, the Company and Nationwide, and then such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance for the
specific purpose for which given.

      SECTION 9. Continuing Security Interest. This Agreement shall create a
continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (a) remain in full
force and effect until the later of (i) the termination of the Commitment or
(ii) the payment in full of the Obligations, (b) be binding upon the Grantor and
(c) inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns. If the
Company shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or
remedy under this instrument by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such
proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall
have been determined adversely to the Company, then and in every such case, the
Grantor and the Company shall be restored to their respective former positions
and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral, and all right, remedies and
powers of the Company shall continue as if no such proceeding had been
instituted.

      SECTION 10. Notices. All notices, offers, acceptances, approvals, waivers,
requests, demands and other communication hereunder or under any other Related
Document shall be in writing, shall be addressed as provided below and shall be

evidencing such obligations and representing a principal indebtedness of
$11,000,000, collectively referred to as the "Existing Nationwide Agreement,"
the balance of such obligations of Sutton Hill to Nationwide being unaffected by
this Agreement and not included in the "Existing Nationwide Agreement");

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the Existing Nationwide Agreement, there are
outstanding loans in the aggregate principal amount of eleven million Dollars
($11,000,000);

      WHEREAS, the Affected Assets are being transferred from Sutton Hill or its
Affiliates to SHC, which is wholly owned by Sutton Hill, and, in connection with
such transfer, Sutton Hill desires to amend and modify the Existing Nationwide

      WHEREAS, as a condition precedent of borrowing under the Citadel
Agreement, SHC and Citadel must enter into the Subordinated Documents (as
hereinafter defined);

      WHEREAS, Nationwide required that, in order to satisfy a condition to the
amendment and modification of the Existing Nationwide Agreement (the Existing
Nationwide Agreement, as so amended and modified, the "Nationwide Agreement"),
that the Original Agreement and this Agreement be entered into among the parties
hereto; and

<PAGE>

      WHEREAS, the purpose of this Agreement is to confirm, as between
Nationwide and Citadel, their respective rights and priorities with respect to
the obligations of SHC and with respect to the Equity Collateral and the

hereafter held as security by Nationwide in respect of the Nationwide
Indebtedness and by Citadel in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

      ("SHC's Affiliates") shall not include Reading, Citadel and their
      respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries; (b) Reading, Citadel and their

      Nationwide's receipt thereof, the requesting party can assume that such
      payment(s) had not been made. Failure to give any of such notices in the

      Indebtedness to the Nationwide Indebtedness as provided herein.

            (b) In the event of a Citadel Agreement Payment Default, Citadel is
      entitled to exercise all rights and remedies pursuant to the terms of the
      Citadel Agreement and the Subordinated Documents. In the event of a
      Citadel Event of Default other than a Citadel Agreement Payment Default,

      the occurrence of the event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
      then, for all purposes of this Agreement, such Citadel Event of Default

      given its prior consent to such release, and (ii) if Citadel shall be

      2.06 hereof or shall acquire the Nationwide Indebtedness pursuant to
      Section 2.11(h) hereof, Nationwide shall assign to Citadel, without

      any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property,

      character, whether in cash, securities or other property (including any

      of the payment of any other indebtedness of SHC being subordinated to the
      Citadel Indebtedness), to which Citadel would be entitled except for the
      provisions of this Section 2.04, shall be paid by SHC, as debtor in
      possession, or any bankruptcy trustee or other agent or other Person
      making such payment or distribution directly to Nationwide, until all
      Nationwide Indebtedness remaining unpaid is Fully Paid, after giving
      effect to any concurrent payments or distributions to or for Nationwide

      the events described in Section 2.02(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall have

      distribution shall be received and held in trust for Nationwide, and shall

of any payments or distributions of cash, securities and other assets with
respect to the Citadel Indebtedness made to or for Nationwide pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be subrogated to the rights of Nationwide to receive any and
all payments or distributions of cash, securities and other assets payable with
respect to the Nationwide Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Citadel
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full. For the purpose of such subrogation,

respect thereto, are nevertheless limited by and subject to Section 11.12 of the
Citadel Agreement.

      to pay the amounts payable with respect to the Citadel Indebtedness as and

      or

                  (ii) affect the relative rights against SHC of Citadel and
      creditors of Citadel other than Nationwide.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary, if
      SHC fails, because of this Agreement or otherwise, to pay principal of or
      interest on the Citadel Indebtedness on the due date thereof, such failure
      shall still be considered an Event of Default under paragraph (a) of
      Section 9.1 of the Citadel Agreement except as otherwise provided in said
      paragraph (a).

      action, inaction or omission in respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness or
      any of the agreements, instruments or documents referred to in clause (i)
      above or in respect of any collateral security for the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or any other indebtedness, liability or obligation of SHC to
      Nationwide, now existing or hereafter arising, all whether or not Citadel
      shall have had notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing and whether or
      not Citadel shall have consented thereto.

            (b) The terms of this Agreement, and the rights of Citadel and the
      obligations of Nationwide arising hereunder, shall not be affected,
      modified or impaired in any manner or to any extent by: (i) any amendment,
      modification or termination of or supplement to the Citadel Indebtedness
      or the Subordinated Documents, or any agreement, instrument or document
      executed or delivered pursuant thereto; (ii) the validity or
      enforceability of any such document; (iii) the release, sale, exchange or
      surrender, in whole or in part, of any collateral security, now or
      hereafter existing, for any of the Citadel Indebtedness or any other
      indebtedness, liability or obligations of SHC to Citadel, now existing or
      hereafter arising; (iv) any exercise or non-exercise of any right, power
      or remedy under or in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness or any of such

      law; or (v) any waiver, consent, release, indulgence, extension, renewal,
      modification, delay or other action, inaction or omission in respect of
      the Citadel Indebtedness or any of the agreements, instruments or
      documents referred to in clause (i) above or in respect of any collateral
      security for the Citadel Indebtedness or any other indebtedness, liability
      or obligation of SHC to Citadel, now existing or hereafter arising, all
      whether or not Nationwide shall have had notice or knowledge of any of the
      foregoing and whether or not Nationwide shall have consented thereto.

      Section 2.09 Provisions to Effectuate Subordination of Citadel
Indebtedness.

            (a) In the event of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding,
      Nationwide is irrevocably authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to
      make and present for and on behalf of Citadel such proofs of claim against
      SHC on account of the Citadel Indebtedness or other motions or pleadings
      as Nationwide may deem expedient or proper, to vote such proofs of claim
      in any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, to the extent permitted
      by law, and to receive and collect any and all payments or distributions
      made thereon in whatever form and to apply such payments or distributions
      on account of any of the Nationwide Indebtedness. Citadel irrevocably
      authorizes and empowers Nationwide to demand, sue for, collect and receive
      each of such payments and distributions and to file claims and take such
      other actions, in the name of Nationwide or Citadel or otherwise, as
      Nationwide may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of this
      Agreement. To the extent that payments or distributions are made in
      property other than cash, Citadel authorizes Nationwide to sell such
      property to such buyers and on such terms as Nationwide, in its reasonable
      discretion, shall determine. Citadel will execute and deliver to
      Nationwide such powers of attorney, assignments and other instruments or
      documents as may be requested by Nationwide in order to enable Nationwide
      to enforce any and all claims upon or with respect to the Citadel
      Indebtedness and to collect and receive any and all payments and
      distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time with respect
      thereto.

            (b) Nationwide agrees that it will not exercise any of the rights or
      remedies under paragraph (a) of this Section 2.09 unless Citadel has
      failed to implement any action in question within ten (10) days prior to
      when such action is required pursuant to an Insolvency or Liquidation
      Proceeding.

            (c) Citadel specifically waives: unless Nationwide shall otherwise
      give its prior written consent or the Nationwide Indebtedness is Fully
      Paid, (i) the right to seek to give its credit (secured or otherwise) to
      SHC in any way under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code unless the same is
      subordinated in all respects to the Nationwide Indebtedness in accordance
      with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) the right to take a
      position inconsistent with or contrary to that of Nationwide (including a
      position by Nationwide to take no action) if SHC seeks to use, sell or
      lease the Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or seeks to
      accept or reject any executory contract or lease under Section 365 of the
      Bankruptcy Code; (iii) the right to receive any collateral (including any
      "super priority" or equal or "priming" or replacement Lien) for the
      Citadel Indebtedness, other than the Equity Collateral and the Borrower
      Collateral, in each case subject to Nationwide's Liens thereon to the
      extent provided herein; and (iv) the right to seek adequate protection in
      respect of the Collateral under Section 363 or 361 of the Bankruptcy Code,
      unless and then only to the extent that


                                       12
<PAGE>

      Nationwide does and then only to the extent consistent with the
      subordinated position of Citadel.

      Section 2.10 Subordination not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of SHC or
Nationwide. (a) No right of Nationwide to enforce subordination as provided
herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or
failure to act on the part of SHC or, except as provided in Section 2.10(c), by
any act or failure to act by Nationwide, or by any noncompliance by SHC with the
provisions and covenants of the Nationwide Agreement or the Subordinated
Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof that Nationwide may have or be
otherwise charged with and regardless of whether such action or failure to act
diminishes or destroys any subrogation or other rights that Citadel may have or
reduces or eliminates any eventual recovery in respect of the Citadel
Indebtedness. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Nationwide may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or
notice to Citadel, except as provided in Section 2.10(c), without incurring
responsibility to Citadel and without impairing or releasing the subordination
and other benefits provided in this Agreement or the obligations hereunder of
Citadel to Nationwide, do any one or more of the following even if any right to
reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Citadel is affected,
impaired or extinguished thereby:

                  (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend,
      renew, modify or amend the terms of the Nationwide Indebtedness or any
      agreement or instrument evidencing, securing or guarantying any Nationwide
      Indebtedness (including increasing the amount of principal, changing the
      time and amount of repayments, increasing the rate of interest or
      otherwise changing the terms of the Nationwide Agreement), exercise or
      delay in or refrain from exercising any right or remedy against SHC and
      otherwise deal freely with SHC or any liability of SHC;

                  (ii) release, exercise or delay in or refrain from exercising
      any right or remedy against, change the terms of any agreement or
      instrument with or otherwise deal freely with any guarantor or any other
      Person liable or contingently liable in any manner for the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or any such liability or contingent liability;

                  (iii) settle or compromise any of the Nationwide Indebtedness
      or any other liability of SHC or any guarantor of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness to Nationwide and apply any sums by whomsoever paid and
      however realized to any liability (including, without limitation, the
      Nationwide Indebtedness) in any manner or order; and

                  (iv) fail to take or to record or otherwise perfect, for any
      reason or for no reason, any Lien securing the Nationwide Indebtedness by
      whomsoever granted, and release, sell, exercise or delay in or refrain
      from exercising any right or remedy against, exchange, enforce, realize
      upon, or otherwise deal freely with, in any manner and in any order, any
      of the Collateral.


                                       13
<PAGE>

            (b) Except as provided in Section 2.10(c), Citadel hereby waives any
      and all notice of the creation, modification, renewal, extension or
      accrual of any Nationwide Indebtedness and notice of or proof of reliance
      by Nationwide upon this Agreement, and the Nationwide Indebtedness shall
      conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in
      reliance upon this Agreement, and all dealings between SHC and Nationwide
      shall be deemed to have been consummated in reliance on this Agreement.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any
      other agreement to the contrary, the consent of Citadel shall be required
      for (i) any amendment or modification of the Nationwide Agreement (any of
      the foregoing being a "Change") (A) changing the dates of payment of
      interest, principal, fees or costs in respect of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or shortening the maturity of or requiring the earlier
      payment of any principal or interest in respect of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness, (B) increasing the rate of interest or the amount of any
      payments (including the amount of any fees payable in respect of the
      Nationwide Indebtedness), except for the increase in rate provided for
      therein following maturity thereof, whether at stated maturity, by
      acceleration or otherwise, or (C) adding any requirement for SHC to pay
      any additional fees in respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness, or (ii) any
      Change making any material terms and conditions of the Nationwide
      Agreement more restrictive or burdensome on SHC than the terms and
      conditions of the Nationwide Agreement delivered to Citadel and in effect
      on the date hereof. If any Change is made in contravention of this Section
      2.10(c), any additional liabilities or obligations to Nationwide imposed
      thereby on SHC shall not constitute obligations secured by the Collateral
      and, with respect to such additional liabilities or obligations,
      Nationwide shall not be entitled to any of the benefits of this Agreement,
      the Security Agreement or the Pledge Agreement.

      Section 2.11 Additional Agreements and Waivers.

            (a) Citadel hereby waives (i) any requirement for marshaling of
      assets by Nationwide in connection with any foreclosure of the Liens of
      Nationwide on any Collateral or any other realization upon such
      Collateral, and (ii) any other principle of election of remedies.

            (b) Nationwide shall not have any obligation or duty, nor shall
      Citadel have any right to direct Nationwide, to retain, perfect, protect
      or release any Collateral (except as provided in Section 2.03(c)), to
      foreclose or refrain from foreclosing the Lien of Nationwide on any
      Collateral, to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Nationwide
      Event of Default, to act or refrain from acting with respect to the
      collection of any claim from any account debtor, guarantor or any other
      party, to realize upon any collateral or otherwise to


                                       14
<PAGE>

      exercise or refrain from exercising any rights or remedies in respect of
      such Lien or such Collateral. Except with respect to a violation of
      Section 2.03(c), Nationwide shall not be subject to any liability on
      account of taking or refraining from taking any action referred to in this
      Section 2.11(b), and Citadel waives and agrees to refrain from asserting
      against Nationwide any claim seeking damages or other relief by way of
      specific performance, injunction or otherwise, with respect to any action
      taken or not taken by Nationwide with respect to SHC, the Collateral or
      any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, Citadel waives the right
      to commence or pursue any legal action on account of the exercise or
      non-exercise of rights, remedies or other conduct of Nationwide under the
      Nationwide Agreement or any document entered into in connection therewith,
      including allegations based on a theory of breach of fiduciary obligations
      of Nationwide, duty of care, duty of good faith, duty of reasonableness,
      negligence, equitable subordination of claims, interference with
      contractual relationships, conflicts of interest or otherwise, except for
      willful misconduct by Nationwide or a violation of Section 2.03(c) hereof.

            (c) Solely between Nationwide and Citadel, Citadel assumes
      responsibility for keeping itself informed as to the condition (financial
      or otherwise), business, assets and operations of SHC, the condition of
      the Collateral and all other circumstances that might in any way affect
      Citadel's risk under the Subordinated Documents and this Agreement
      (including without limitation the risk of non-payment of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness), and Nationwide shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever
      to obtain or disclose to Citadel any information or documents relative to
      such condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or operations of
      SHC, such Collateral or such risk, whether acquired by Nationwide in the
      course of its relationship with SHC or otherwise. The terms of this
      Section 2.11(c) shall not impair or affect SHC's obligations arising under
      any Credit Agreement or any of the Subordinated Documents.

            (d) Citadel agrees that the subordination hereunder applies
      regardless of the validity or enforceability of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or the Nationwide Agreement or the validity, perfection or
      enforceability of the Liens securing the Nationwide Indebtedness.

            (e) Citadel agrees not to (i) take any action to challenge the
      validity, enforceability or amount of any guaranty of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness given by any other Person, (ii) induce any other Person to
      take such action, or (iii) cooperate with any other Person in taking such
      action.

            (f) Within fifteen (15) days following the written request from
      Nationwide or SHC, Citadel shall deliver to SHC and Nationwide an estoppel
      certificate setting forth (i) the amount of principal and interest then
      due, if any, and other amounts then payable (to the extent then
      ascertainable), if any, in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness and (ii)
      whether or not the Subordinated Documents have been amended since the date
      hereof or the date of the


                                       15
<PAGE>

      last such certificate delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be, and
      if so, providing a copy of the relevant amendment documents.

            (g) Within fifteen (15) days following the written request from
      Citadel, each of Nationwide and SHC shall deliver to Citadel an estoppel
      certificate setting forth (i) the amount of principal and interest then
      due, and other amounts then payable (to the extent ascertainable), in
      respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness and (ii) whether or not the
      Nationwide Agreement has been amended since the date hereof or the date of
      the last such certificate delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be,
      and, if so, providing a copy of the relevant amendment documents.
      Nationwide confirms that, as of the date hereof, the outstanding principal
      sum of the Nationwide Indebtedness is eleven million Dollars
      ($11,000,000), and no other sums are now accrued or payable under the
      Nationwide Agreement except accrued interest, not currently due, in
      accordance with the terms of the Nationwide Agreement.

            (h) (i) At any time following a Trigger Event, upon the request of
      Citadel and upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to
      Nationwide, Nationwide will assign to Citadel, without any recourse to, or
      representation or warranty by, Nationwide, the Nationwide Agreement (other
      than Nationwide's claims, if any, in respect of interest and other fees
      and costs thereunder, to the extent not included in the Nationwide
      Accrual) (the "Retained Claims"), which Retained Claims shall be retained
      by and remain the property of Nationwide) upon the payment to Nationwide,
      or as it may direct in writing, of the sum of (x) the principal amount of
      the Nationwide Indebtedness or $11,000,000, whichever is less, and (y) the
      Nationwide Accrual; provided, however, that the Nationwide Indebtedness
      and the Nationwide Agreement, as assigned, will then be subject to Section
      11.12 of the Citadel Agreement. Upon such assignment, this Agreement shall
      terminate and all rights and obligations between Nationwide and Citadel
      shall terminate, except as provided in this Section 2.11(h). Upon such
      assignment, the combined assigned Nationwide Indebtedness and the Citadel
      Indebtedness shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as if such
      combined Indebtedness were the Nationwide Indebtedness and the Retained
      Claims shall be treated as if such Retained Claims were the Citadel
      Indebtedness; provided, however, that nothing herein shall affect, limit
      or impair the right of Nationwide to enforce, collect and retain free from
      any limitations or restrictions of this Agreement payment of the Retained
      Claims from any Person other than SHC.

            (ii) At Citadel's election, payment to Nationwide or an Affiliate
      thereof for the amount required to be paid pursuant to subsection
      2.11(h)(i) may be made by it or an Affiliate making and delivering a note
      for the full amount due, payable in full ninety (90) days from its date,
      with interest thereon payable at the rate of 8.25% monthly in arrears and
      on the date of payment in full (increasing to 9.75% following maturity
      thereof, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise);
      provided, however, that Nationwide (or such


                                       16
<PAGE>

      Affiliate) may require that the maturity date of the note be extended to
      such later date, not beyond the expiration of the Initial Term of the
      Lease Agreement as may be requested by Nationwide (or such Affiliate) in a
      notice given to Citadel not later than sixty (60) days prior to the
      originally stated maturity date of such note, in which case the maker of
      the note and, if applicable, the guarantor thereof shall execute and
      deliver such additional documents to confirm such extension as may be
      appropriate. Such note, if made by an Affiliate of Citadel, shall be fully
      guaranteed as to payment by Citadel, or may in the first instance be made
      by Citadel (in which case no guaranty shall be required). The note and, if
      applicable, the guaranty shall be on terms and conditions reasonably
      satisfactory to Nationwide. The option provided herein in favor of Citadel
      to pay through delivery of a note and, if applicable, a guaranty shall not
      be available in connection with the exercise of the Purchase Option
      pursuant to the Lease Agreement and any such note shall be pre-payable in
      full upon the closing pursuant to the Purchase Option or the purchase or
      other acquisition by Citadel (or an Affiliate) of the Membership Interest
      in SHC.

                  (iii) Upon the payment to Nationwide of the amount required to
      be paid to it pursuant to subsection 2.11(h)(i) (whether in cash or by the
      making and delivery of a note and, if applicable, a guaranty), Nationwide
      shall, as Citadel may request, either satisfy or assign (without recourse
      to, or representation or warranty by, Nationwide) as Citadel shall direct
      any and all Liens securing the Nationwide Indebtedness and any claims
      (other than the Retained Claims) with respect thereto; provided, however,
      that such Liens and claims, if so assigned, will be subject to the
      limitations of Section 11.12 of the Citadel Agreement. Any and all
      Retained Claims shall be unsecured claims and any judgment thereon shall
      not be enforced against or be or become Liens on any assets of SHC.

                  (iv) If the Trigger Event is a Citadel Proceeding and if a Bad
      Faith Determination is entered with respect thereto, then Citadel shall be
      liable: (x) to Nationwide, for all costs and expenses (including
      reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other professional advisors)
      incurred by Nationwide in connection with the Citadel Proceeding and in
      seeking such Bad Faith Determination and for interest (at the
      Reimbursement Rate) on any taxes paid by Nationwide as a result of the
      transfer or repayment of the Nationwide Indebtedness for the period from
      the date such taxes were paid until the date such taxes would have been
      paid if the Nationwide Indebtedness had been repaid at the maturity date
      thereof; and (y) to SHC and its Affiliates, for all costs and expenses
      (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other professional
      advisors) incurred by SHC and its Affiliates in connection with the
      Citadel Proceeding and in seeking such Bad Faith Determination. If
      following the initiation of a Citadel Proceeding either Nationwide or any
      of its Affiliates or SHC or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person
      acting in concert with or with the support of any of them, unsuccessfully
      asserts a claim for a Bad Faith Determination, then Nationwide (if it or
      any of its Affiliates asserted such claim) or James J. Cotter and Michael
      R. Forman (if SHC or any of its Affiliates asserted such claim) shall be


                                       17
<PAGE>

      liable to Citadel for all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees
      and expenses of counsel and other professionals) incurred by Citadel in
      defending against the claim for a Bad Faith Determination.

      Section 2.12. Transferees of Creditors; Notice of Subordination.

            (a) Each Creditor shall not at any time sell, assign, pledge,
      hypothecate, or otherwise transfer its Credit Agreement (or any of its
      respective rights or interests therein), unless and until the transferee,
      pledgee, or other appropriate party shall have assumed in a writing,
      reasonably satisfactory to the other, all of the transferring, pledging,
      or hypothecating Creditor's obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) Each Creditor warrants and represents to the other Creditor that
      it has not previously assigned any interest in its respective
      Indebtedness, that no party owns an interest in its Indebtedness other
      than itself and that its entire Indebtedness is owing only to it. Each
      Creditor covenants that its entire Indebtedness shall continue to be owing
      only to it, unless assigned or transferred in accordance with the terms of
      this Agreement.

      Section 2.13. Representations and Warranties. (a) Each Creditor hereby
represents and warrants for the benefit of the other as follows: (i) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement are within its corporate
power and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each Creditor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by equitable principles or by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally; and (ii) all consents for, in the case of
Nationwide, the amending of the Existing Nationwide Agreement to the Nationwide
Agreement and, in the case of Citadel, the funding to SHC pursuant to the
Citadel Agreement have been obtained and are in effect (or will be obtained and
in effect upon the date of funding).

            (b) Nationwide hereby represents to Citadel that, upon the tender in
      cash of the amount of the Nationwide Indebtedness in the amount and
      subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.11(h)(i) hereof, the
      assignment provided for in said Section 2.11(h)(i) will be provided
      whether or not Nationwide is then the holder of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness.

      Section 2.14. Restriction on Amendments to Subordinated Documents. Neither
SHC nor Citadel shall, without the prior written consent of Nationwide, waive,
amend or modify any of the terms and conditions of any Subordinated Document if
the effect of such waiver, amendment or modification is to (a) advance maturity
dates, (b) increase rates or amounts of payments, (c) change any provision
herein, or (d) otherwise make any such terms and conditions more restrictive or
burdensome on SHC than the terms and conditions of the Subordinated Documents
delivered to Nationwide and in effect on the date hereof or at the time of such
amendment or modification.


                                       18
<PAGE>

      Section 2.15. Continuing Agreement of Subordination. This is a continuing
agreement of subordination and Nationwide may continue, at any time and without
notice to Citadel, to extend credit or other financial accommodations to or for
the benefit of SHC in reliance hereon. This Agreement shall be effective and may
not be terminated or otherwise revoked by Citadel until the Nationwide
Indebtedness has been Fully Paid. If Citadel shall have any right under
Applicable Law or otherwise to terminate or revoke this Agreement which cannot
be waived, then, to the extent permitted by law, such termination or revocation
shall not be effective until written notice of such termination or revocation,
signed by Citadel, is given to the holder of such Nationwide Indebtedness. Any
such termination or revocation shall not affect this Agreement in relation to
(a) any Nationwide Indebtedness which arose prior to the receipt thereof, or (b)
any of the Nationwide Indebtedness created after receipt thereof, if such
Nationwide Indebtedness was incurred either through committed advances or
re-advances by Nationwide pursuant to the Nationwide Agreement.

      Section 2.16. Further Assurances.

            (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Nationwide
      Default, Citadel shall duly and promptly take such action as Nationwide
      may reasonably request (a) to collect the Citadel Indebtedness for the
      account of Nationwide and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claims
      in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness, (b) to execute and deliver to
      Nationwide such assignments or other instruments as Nationwide may
      reasonably request in order to enable it to enforce any and all claims
      with respect to the Citadel Indebtedness and any security interests
      securing payment of the Citadel Indebtedness, and (c) to collect and
      receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or
