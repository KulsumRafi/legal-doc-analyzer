<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) In the event that any claim or demand for which
        an Indemnifying Party would be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
        against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a third party, such
        Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness give notice (the &quot;Claim
        Notice&quot;) to the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of
        and basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
        extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
        claim or demand). The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the

        provisions of this Agreement, and, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Party's
        ability to defend against the claim or demand is materially prejudiced. The Indemnifying
        Party shall have twenty (20) days from the personal delivery or mailing, in accordance
        with <u>Section 12.5</u>, of the Claim Notice (the &quot;Notice Period &quot;) to notify

        it desires, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified
        Party against such claim or demand; provided, however, that any Indemnified Party is
        hereby authorized, but is not obligated, prior to and during the Notice Period to file any
        motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect
        its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
        Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
        against such claim or demand, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the last sentence

        Party elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to the claim in question, in
        making any counterclaim against the person asserting the third party claim or demand, or
        any cross-complaint against any person other than an Affiliate of Buyer if Buyer is the
        Indemnified Party. </p>

        against the Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being
        asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Indemnified Party
        shall send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. If the
        Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.6. <u>Further Assurances</u>. The parties agree
to furnish upon request to each other such further information, to execute and deliver to
each other such other documents, and to do such other acts and things, all as the other
party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement
and the documents referred to in this Agreement. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.7. <u>Waiver</u>. The rights and remedies of the
parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any
delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power,
or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege
will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which
it is given; and no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.8. <u>Entire Agreement and Modification</u>. This

executed by the party to be charged with the amendment. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.9. <u>Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party
Rights</u>. Neither party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other parties except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer provided that Buyer will remain liable under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in
all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the
parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit
of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns. </p>

Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the

force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.11. <u>Section Headings, Construction</u>. The
headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not
affect its construction or interpretation. All references to &quot;Section&quot; or
&quot;Sections&quot; refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All
words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the

principles thereof. </p>
