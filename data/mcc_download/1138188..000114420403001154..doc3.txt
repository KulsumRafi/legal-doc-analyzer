          time to time following the date hereof for an amount equal to the Fair
          Market Value (as hereinafter defined).  For greater certainty,  the IP

          following the date of this Agreement.

     (b)  Triggering   Event.  The  term  "Triggering   Event"  shall  mean  the

               Insolvency Act (Canada) or similar legislation;

          (v)  Sciax or Ugomedia  shall be declared or adjudicated a bankrupt or
               a liquidator, trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, receiver, manager
               or any other  officer with similar  powers is appointed by or for
               Sciax or  Ugomedia  or Sciax or  Ugomedia's  business or Sciax or
               Ugomedia consents to such appointment;

          (vi) Sciax or Ugomedia  shall  propose a  compromise  or  arrangement,
               shall institute proceedings to be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent,
               shall  consent to the  initiation of such  proceedings,  or seeks
               formal protection from its creditors;or

          (vii) a breach of this Agreement by Ugomedia and/or Sciax.

     (c)  Notice of Triggering Event. Sciax and Ugomedia shall provide a written
          notice of the Triggering  Event (the "EVENT NOTICE") to Smart at least
          thirty (30) Business Days prior to the  occurrence of such  Triggering
          Event or in the case of (v) above,  as soon as knowledge of such event
          is known to Sciax or Ugomedia.  For the purposes of this Agreement,  a
          "Business Day" shall mean any day except  Saturday,  Sunday or any day
          on which  banks are  generally  not open for  business  in the City of
          Toronto, Ontario.

     (d)  Exercise of Purchase  Right.  To exercise  the Purchase  Right,  Smart
          shall notify Sciax and Ugomedia in writing of its intent to do so (the
          "EXERCISE  NOTICE")  within  five (5)  Business  Days  (the  "EXERCISE
          PERIOD") of  receiving  the Event  Notice.  Upon giving such  Exercise
          Notice,  Smart  shall be bound to  acquire  the IP  Assets at the Fair
          Market Value.  Failure by Smart to deliver the Exercise  Notice during
          the Exercise  Period shall be deemed a waiver by Smart of his right to
          acquire the IP Assets.

     (e)  Selection of Valuator. Within five (5) Business Days of delivering the
          Exercise  Notice,  Smart  shall  deliver to Sciax and  Ugomedia a list
          setting  forth the  names of at least  three  (3)  certified  business
          valuators ("VALUATORS") for the determination of the Fair Market Value
          of the IP Assets.  Sciax and Ugomedia shall select one of the proposed
          Valuators  following  which Smart,  Sciax and Ugomedia  shall  jointly
          retain the Valuator to determine the Fair Market Value, as at the date
          of the Triggering Event, of the IP Assets, applying such principles of
          valuation as the Valuator considers appropriate in the circumstances.

     (f)  Co-operation  and Delivery of  Valuation.  Each of the parties  hereto
          shall  in  all   respects   co-operate   with  the   Valuator  in  the
          determination  of  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  the  IP  Assets.   In
          particular,  each of the parties shall make  available to the Valuator
          all such documents and information  with respect to the affairs of the
          parties  as  the   Valuator  may   reasonably   require  to  make  its
          determination of the Fair Market Value, and shall make their personnel

                                       2
<PAGE>

          available  at all  reasonable  times to assist in such  determination.
          Within ten (10) Business Days following its appointment,  the Valuator
          shall provide each of Smart, Sciax and Ugomedia with its determination
          of Fair Market Value. If the Valuator  specifies a range of values for
          the Fair Market Value, the Fair Market Value shall be the mid-point of
          the range.

     (g)  No Appeal of  Valuation.  The valuation of the IP Assets as determined
          by the  Valuator  shall be final and  binding on all parties and there
          shall be no appeal from the valuation determined by the Valuator.

     (h)  Fees and  Disbursements.  All fees,  disbursements and other costs and
          expenses associated with the determination of the Fair Market Value by
          the Valuator in accordance  with the  provisions of this Section shall
          be borne by Smart.

     (i)  Delivery of IP Assets.  Following the determination of the Fair Market
          Value by the  Valuator,  the  transfer  of the IP Assets  shall  occur
          within  ten  (10)  Business   Days  (the   "CLOSING   DATE")  of  such
          determination  and Sciax shall cause the IP Assets to be sold to Smart
          free  and   clear  of  all   mortgages,   liens,   pledges,   charges,
          encumbrances,   equities,  claims,  covenants,   conditions  or  other
          restrictions in consideration for the payment of the Fair Market Value
          by  Smart  to  Sciax  which  Sciax  acknowledges  shall  be  the  sole
          consideration  to be paid for the IP Assets.  In the event Smart fails
          to pay the Fair  Market  Value  for the IP  Assets  on or  before  the
          Closing Date, Smart's right to acquire the IP Assets shall terminate.

2.   ENFORCEABILITY.

     The parties hereto  acknowledge and agree that the  enforceability  of this
     Agreement  may  be  limited  by  any  applicable  bankruptcy,   insolvency,

     (a)  Arbitration.  All disputes  between parties arising in connection with

          accordance herewith. The arbitration shall be held in Toronto, Ontario
          in accordance with the Arbitration Act (Ontario), as amended from time
          to  time.  The law  governing  the  procedures  and  substance  of the
          arbitration  will be that of the Province of Ontario.  The arbitration
          proceedings,  all  documents  and  all  testimony,  written  or  oral,
          produced  in  connection  therewith  shall be kept  confidential.  The
          arbitrator  may  determine  all  questions  of  law  and  jurisdiction
          (including  questions as to whether the dispute is arbitrable) and has
          the right to grant legal and equitable  relief  (including  injunctive
          and other interim relief and the right to grant  permanent and interim
          injunctive relief),  and shall apportion all costs between the parties
          taking into consideration,  among other factors, the percentage of the
          total  amount in dispute that is  represented  by the amount of claims
          asserted  by  a  party  but  rejected  by  the  arbitrator,  including
          reasonable legal fees, interest and costs of the arbitration, provided
          that  nothing  herein  shall  prevent the parties  hereto from seeking
          interim injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction pending
          resolution  of the  dispute  in  accordance  with  this  section.  The
          arbitrator  may not amend or otherwise  alter the terms and conditions
          of the Agreement.

     (b)  Selection of Arbitrator. The parties shall have ten (10) Business Days
          to agree upon the  arbitrator  commencing  on the day on which written
          notice was given by the party initiating the arbitration.  Upon expiry
          for the  fifteen  day  period and  regardless  of an  agreement  being
          reached as the  arbitrator,  either or both  parties  may apply to the
          court  to  appoint  the  arbitrator.   The  court  shall  appoint  the
          arbitrator  within  twenty (20)  Business  Days after such request and
          shall notify the parties of the appointment.
