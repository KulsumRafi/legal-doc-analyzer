      D. As a condition precedent to the execution of the First Amendment, Agent
requires that Trustor and Agent amend a certain provision of the Deed of Trust
as hereinafter set forth.

      NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

      (a) Pursuant to the First Amendment, Trustor and Agent have, among other
things, increased the Maximum Revolver Amount. The obligations secured by the
Deed of Trust, as set forth in the Deed of Trust, include without limitation the
obligations of Trustor to Agent under the Loan Agreement, as modified by the
First Amendment, and all further modifications thereof.

      (b) Except as herein specifically supplemented and amended, the Deed of
Trust, which is incorporated by reference herein, is hereby ratified and
confirmed, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

      (c) This Modification may be executed in counterparts, each of which, when
executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which,
when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
