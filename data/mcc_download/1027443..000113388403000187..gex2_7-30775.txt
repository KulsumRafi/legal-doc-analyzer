      apparatus, method or design encompassed within the scope of the drawings
      or the claims of such patents. Without limiting the generality of the
      foregoing, the term "Trade Rights" includes the Midbar patents set out in

      is provided herein is not assignable without the consent of another party,

      assignment thereof if such assignment or attempted assignment would
      constitute a breach thereof. Seller and Buyer agree to use their
      reasonable best efforts (without any requirement on the part of Buyer to
      pay any money or agree to any material change in the terms of any such
      Contract) to obtain the consent of such other party to the assignment of
      any such Contract to Buyer in all cases in which such consent is or may be
      required for such assignment. If any such consent shall not be obtained,
      Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable arrangement
      designed to provide for Buyer the benefits intended to be assigned to
      Buyer under the relevant Contract, including enforcement at the cost and

                                       2

      other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof
      by such other party or otherwise, and Buyer undertakes to cooperate
      with Seller to allow the fulfillment of the Seller's Liabilities under
      any such Contract, as if such Contract had been assigned to Buyer,
      until such time as Seller completes its liquidation proceedings (which it
      intends to commence following the Closing), provided, however, that Buyer
      shall not bear any liability in excess of the liability that Buyer would
      have borne had Buyer assumed and taken assignment of such Contracts. If

      shall not be deemed to be a Purchased Asset hereunder.

      performance installments calculated as a percentage of Performance Revenue
      recognized during the respective installment periods identified in the

      [*] percent ([*]%) of Buyer's Net Revenue from Buyer's audio copy
      protection and audio digital rights management business (the "Audio
      Business") included in Buyer's published financial statements reported in
      accordance with U.S. GAAP from the period beginning on the Closing Date

      ------------------------------- ----------------------------------
         Closing Date through [*]                   [*]%
      ------------------------------- ----------------------------------
              [*] through [*]                       [*]%
      ------------------------------- ----------------------------------
              [*] through [*]                       [*]%

              [*] through [*]                       [*]%

For the purpose of assisting Seller with determining net revenue from the Audio

      395-9064 (the "Escrow Agent"), under the terms of the attached escrow
      agreement set out in Exhibit A, to be entered into by and among the

                                       7
<PAGE>

     Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller on the Closing Date (the "Escrow
     Agreement"), the sum of [*] U.S. dollars ($[*]) out of the Minimum Payment
     (the "Initial Escrow Amount"), which Initial Escrow Amount, together with
     the Additional Escrow Amount (defined below), shall be available to secure
     the indemnification obligations of Seller as provided in Section 10. In
     addition, at the time of each Additional Contingent Payment, Buyer shall
     withhold from such payment to Seller and deliver to the Escrow Agent, to be
     held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, an amount equal
     to [*] percent ([*]%) of the Additional Contingent Payments due in respect
     of the [*] through [*] Installment Periods, and [*] percent ([*]%) of the
     Additional Contingent Payments due in respect of the [*] through [*]
     Installment Periods (collectively, the "Additional Escrow Amount" and,
     together with the Initial Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Account")), which
     shall be available to secure the indemnification obligations of the Seller
     as provided in Section 10. The Escrow Account shall be the sole and
     exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to any claims it may have against
     Seller under or in connection with this Agreement, other than in the case
     of fraud, and shall be held by the Escrow Agent until the termination of
     the Applicable Escrow Period (as such term is defined in the Escrow
     Agreement).

(b)  CASH TO SELLER AT CLOSING. At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the
     Minimum Payment in immediately available funds, less the Initial Escrow
     Amount delivered to the Escrow Agent under the terms of the Escrow
     Agreement, to a bank account of Seller as shall be designated by Seller in
     writing at least seven (7) days prior to Closing.

(c)  ADDITIONAL CONTINGENT PAYMENTS. Additional Contingent Payments shall be due
     sixty (60) days after the last day of each respective Installment Period
     based on the amount of revenue billed during such Installment Period from
     the Audio Business; provided that (i) the Additional Contingent Payments
     due in respect of each Installment Period shall be adjusted in the
     following Installment Periods for amounts paid to Seller with respect to
     preceding Installment Periods that have not been collected, and (ii) the
     Additional Contingent Payment due with respect to the last Installment
     Period shall be paid based on amounts actually collected and any such
     amounts not collected within 60 days following the last installment period
     shall be paid within 10 days of collection thereof (whenever collected). No
     further Additional Contingent Payments will be due thereafter.

(d)  Allocation of Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration shall be
     allocated among the tangible and intangible Purchased Assets sold
     hereunder, as shall be determined by Buyer (with the consent of Seller,
     which shall not be unreasonably withheld), and set forth in Schedule 3.2(d)
     hereto at Closing or promptly after the Closing.

3.3  SALE OF THE AUDIO BUSINESS.

In the event Buyer sells the Audio Business prior to [*] to a third party which
is not an Affiliate of Buyer, then Buyer, at its option, either:

(a)  will pay the Seller an amount (the "Final Payment") equal to the lesser of:
     (1) twenty-five million U.S. dollars ($25,000,000.00) and (2) a cash or
     cash equivalent (on the basis of

                                       8
<PAGE>

     the fair market value of non-cash consideration received) amount equal to
     [*]% of the total consideration received for the sale of the Audio
     Business, minus

     (i)  the total of the Minimum Payment and the cumulative Additional
          Contingent Payments paid as of the date of the same, minus

     (ii) [*] percent ([*]%) of any escrow amount retained by the buyer of such
          Audio Business (the "New Escrow"), reduced by the total amounts held
          in the Escrow Account that have not been released to Seller as of such
          date (the "Seller Portion of New Escrow); provided, however, that such
          Seller Portion of New Escrow shall be paid to the Seller as and when
          (if at all) such New Escrow is released from escrow to Buyer;

     provided, however, that, in any event, such Final Payment shall not exceed
     the sum equal to $8,000,000 less the cumulative Additional Contingent
     Payments paid to Seller as of the date of the sale; or

(b)  will require such third party, as a condition of such sale, to assume the
     obligations to make payments of the Additional Contingent Payments required
     above (subject to their terms).

     All the above amounts shall be supplemented by VAT, to the extent
applicable.

     By way of example, if as of the date of sale, Buyer paid a total of $[*]
     million from the Minimum Payment and any Additional Contingent Payments
     paid by Buyer, and Buyer sold the Audio Business for $[*] million subject
     to a $[*] million New Escrow Account with a $[*] balance on the original
     Escrow Account, Seller would receive a partial Final Payment of $[*] on the
     date of sale and additional Final Payments totaling $[*] upon the release
     of the New Escrow, when and if released, in accordance with the pro rata
     share of the aggregate amount released from the New Escrow (and, for the
     avoidance of doubt, the $[*] remaining in the Escrow Account and already
     paid by Buyer as part of the Minimum Payment and Additional Contingent
     Payments, when and if released under the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If
     the sales price after the deduction of the New Escrow Account was greater
     than $[*] million, Seller would receive a Final Payment of $[*] million
     less the unreleased portion of the Escrow Account. If the sales price in
     this example was equal to or less than $[*] million before the deduction of
     the New Escrow Account, Seller would not receive a Final Payment and the
     Buyer will continue to hold the unreleased portion of the Escrow Account.

(a)   INSURANCE POLICIES. Set forth in SCHEDULE 4.11(a) is a complete and
      accurate list and description of all policies of fire, liability, product
      liability, workers compensation, health and other forms of insurance
      presently in effect with respect to the business and properties of Seller,
      true and correct copies of which have heretofore been delivered to Buyer.
      SCHEDULE 4.11(a) includes, without limitation, the carrier, the
      description of coverage, the limits of coverage, retention or deductible
      amounts, amount of annual premiums, date of expiration and the date
      through which premiums have been paid with respect to each such policy,
      and any pending claims. All such policies are valid, outstanding and
      enforceable policies and provide insurance coverage for the properties,
      assets and operations of Seller, of the kinds, in the amounts and against
      the risks customarily maintained by organizations similarly situated; and
      no such policy (nor any previous policy) provides for or is subject to any
      currently enforceable retroactive rate or premium adjustment, loss sharing
      arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or
      partially out of events arising prior to the date hereof. No notice of
      cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such
      policy, and Seller has no Knowledge of any act or omission of Seller that
      could result in cancellation of any such policy prior to its scheduled
      expiration date. Seller has not been refused any insurance with respect to
      any aspect of the operations of the business nor has its coverage been
      limited by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for insurance or
      with which it has carried insurance during the last three years. Seller
      has duly and timely made all claims it has been entitled to make under
      each policy of insurance. There is no claim by Seller pending under any
      such policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
      by the underwriters of such policies, and Seller does not know of any
      basis for

                                       16

      denial of any claim under any such policy. Seller has not received any
      written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier issuing any such
      policy that insurance rates therefor will hereafter be substantially
      increased (except to the extent that insurance rates may be increased for
      all similarly situated risks) or that there will hereafter be a
      cancellation or an increase in a deductible (or an increase in premiums in
      order to maintain an existing deductible) or nonrenewal of any such
      policy. Such policies are sufficient in all material respects for
      compliance by Seller with all requirements of law and with the
      requirements of all material contracts to which Seller is a party.

(b)   INSURANCE CLAIMS. Set forth in SCHEDULE 4.11(b) is a true and correct copy

      or commitment of Seller is in full force and effect and Seller is not in
      default under any lease, contract or commitment, nor has any event or
      omission occurred which through the passage of time or the giving of
      notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or cause the
      acceleration of any of Seller's obligations or result in the creation of
      any Lien on any of the assets owned, used or occupied by Seller. Except as
      set forth in SCHEDULE 4.12(m), no third party is, to the Seller's
      Knowledge, in default under any lease, contract or commitment to which
      Seller is a party, nor does the Seller have any Knowledge of an event or
      omission occurred which, through the passage of time or the giving of
      notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or give rise to an
      automatic termination, or the right of discretionary termination, thereof.

      the effect, before or after Closing, of triggering any "most favored

                                       24
<PAGE>

waiver or loss of confidential or privileged status of the information based
upon such possession or discovery. Seller hereby consents to Buyer's
consultation with legal, accounting and other professional advisors to Seller
concerning advice rendered to Seller prior to the Closing regarding Seller's
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, excluding, however,
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the transactions entered into

other reports, and to otherwise wind up and conclude its business.

6.4   SALES TAX MATTERS.

Seller shall pay and be responsible for all capital gains and other Taxes
applicable under any applicable law in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition and without deviating from the
above, Buyer will withhold and deduct from the Purchase Price all applicable
Israeli deductions and withholding Taxes, provided that Buyer will reduce such
deduction or withholding to the extent provided by applicable law in the event
Seller provides to Buyer certificates or other documentation, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, evidencing any valid exemption from
such deduction or withholding.

6.5   NON-COMPETITION.

As a condition to the Closing, and as an inducement to Buyer to execute this
Agreement and complete the transaction contemplated hereby, and in order to
preserve the goodwill associated with Seller's Business being acquired pursuant

in the form of Exhibit B (the "Seller Non-Competition Agreement").

6.6   COVENANTS OF BUYER.

(a)   REPORTS. The Buyer shall furnish to the Seller, within sixty (60) days of
      the termination of each Installment Period, a report setting forth in
      reasonable detail, the sales and amounts collected by Buyer during such
      Installment Period, which reports shall include names of customers,
      products purchased, amounts billed, terms of payment and amounts
      collected.

(b)   ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS. Seller shall have the right, at its own
      expense, during the Performance Period and for a period of one (1) year
      thereafter, to have an independent public accountant located in the San
      Francisco Bay area examine not more than once in each Installment Period
      the financial books and records of account relevant to the Buyer's Audio
      Business, which examination shall be conducted during normal business
      hours and upon reasonable notice to Buyer, to determine the Buyer's
      compliance with its obligations hereunder. If errors in the Seller's favor
      are discovered as a result of such

                                       25
<PAGE>

      examination, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of any such
      deficiency and if such error is equal to or exceeds 5%, the Buyer shall,
      in addition to the payment of any such deficiency, reimburse Seller for
      twice the expense of such examination, not including travel fees. Such
      reimbursement of audit expenses shall be capped in any event at Twenty
      Thousand U.S. Dollars ($20,000.00). For this purpose, the Buyer shall
      grant the Seller's representatives the right of access to all relevant
      business documents, have copies prepared thereof and provide all necessary
      information. As a condition to such examination, the independent public
      accountant selected by Seller shall execute a written agreement,
      reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Buyer, to maintain in
      confidence all information obtained during the course of any such
      examination except for disclosure to Seller as necessary for the above
      purpose. The findings of such independent public accountant shall be
      binding on the parties hereto.

      behalf of Seller, except contracts, commitments, purchases or sales which
      are in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice,

      not have been required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule had they

      retention bonuses, vacation pay, managers' insurance policies, employer's
      social security matching funds, workers' compensation payments, education
      funds, pension funds, severance pay funds, and any other funds, (including
      with respect to stock options or similar equity rights granted to such
      Employee in Seller ("Employee Options")) to which any of such Employees is
      entitled through the Closing Date (by applicable Law or agreement), and
      pay to such Employee the balance of employment and severance benefits, if

      as well as liability with respect to employee stock options) related to
      the employment (and termination, if applicable) of any Employee that
      accrued before, during or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
      any liability with respect to any Transferred Employees relating to the
      agreements between Buyer and such Transferred Employees or to the period
      following the Closing Date shall be Buyer's (taking into account Seller's
      obligation to transfer all Benefits and Liabilities concerning all
      Transferred Employee that have accrued through the Closing, pursuant to
      Section 7.4(b)).

7.5   CONSENTS.

      after notice of any such Claim, fails to defend such Claim actively and in
      good faith, the Indemnified Party will (upon further notice) have the
      right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim or
      consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Claim, on behalf
      of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party, and the
      Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have no right to challenge the
      Indemnified Party's defense, compromise, settlement or consent to
      judgment; provided the Indemnified Party promptly notifies the other
      party, and consults the other party in good faith with respect to any
      proposed compromise or settlement.

(c)   INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S RIGHTS. Anything in this Article 10 to the contrary
      notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that a Claim may
      materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a
      result of money damages or other money payments, the Indemnified Party
      shall have the right to defend, compromise or settle such Claim (other
      than with respect to the payment of money damages or money payments), and
      (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the
      Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry
      of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
      the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a
      release from all Liability in respect of such Claim.

10.4  INDEMNIFICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE A THIRD PARTY
      CLAIM.

In the event of a Claim which does not involve a third party (a "Direct Claim"),
the party requested to be indemnified shall notify the other party of such
Direct Claim with reasonable promptness, specifying, to the extent known, the
nature, circumstances and amount of such Direct Claim (a "Direct Claim Notice").
If the other party notifies the party giving the Direct Claim Notice that it
disputes the other party's right of indemnification with respect to the Claim
set forth in a Direct Claim Notice, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute and, in the event that such efforts are unsuccessful within
thirty (30) days, shall resolve such dispute in accordance with the provisions
of Section 13.6.

10.5  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

The Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the Indemnified Party any amount due
under this Article 10. Upon judgment, determination, settlement or compromise of
any third party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay promptly on behalf of
the Indemnified Party, and/or to the Indemnified Party in reimbursement of any
amount theretofore required to be paid by it, the amount so determined by
judgment, determination, settlement or compromise and all other Claims of the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto, unless in the case of a judgment an
appeal is made from the judgment. If the Indemnifying Party desires to appeal
from an adverse judgment, then the Indemnifying Party shall post and pay the
cost of the security or bond to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal.
Upon the payment in full by the Indemnifying Party of such amounts, the
Indemnifying Party shall succeed to the rights of such Indemnified Party, to the
extent not waived in settlement, against the third party who made such third
party Claim.

10.6  NO WAIVER.

constitute a waiver by any party of its rights to indemnification hereunder.

      prevented the Closing from occurring on or before such date.

(c)   By Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before November

      with the effect set forth in Section 12.2(c) hereof.

(c)   EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
      Section 12.2 shall not in any way terminate, limit or restrict the rights

      warranties, covenants, agreements, conditions or other provisions of this
      Agreement prior to termination hereof. In addition to the right of either

      common law to redress for any such breach or violation, either party whose

      (including, without limitation, interest (including prejudgment interest
      in any litigated matter), penalties, court costs, and attorneys' fees and
      expenses) asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by the

      resulting from such breach or violation. Subject to the foregoing, the
      parties' obligations under Section 13.9 of this Agreement shall survive
