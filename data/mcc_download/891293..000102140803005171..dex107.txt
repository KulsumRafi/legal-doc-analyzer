                                 LEASE AGREEMENT

THIS LEASE AGREEMENT ("Lease") is made this 20th day of August, 2002
("Effective Date"), between Elliott Park LLC, a Washington limited liability
company ("Landlord"), and Cell Therapeutics, Inc., a Washington corporation,
("Tenant"). The parties agree as follows:

1.   FUNDAMENTAL LEASE PROVISIONS; DEFINITIONS; EXHIBITS.

Section 1, unless otherwise specifically modified by provisions of this Lease.

     1.1.      Broker. "Broker" shall mean Colliers International. A commission
shall be paid by Landlord to Broker pursuant to a separate agreement between
Landlord and Broker.

     1.2.      Building. "Building" shall mean the structure commonly known as
Elliott Park North. The Building is situated on a portion of the real property
legally described in Exhibit A and has a postal address of 201 Elliott Avenue
West, Seattle, Washington 98119.

     1.3.      Premises. The "Premises" shall mean the space consisting of
approximately 63,836 net rentable square feet located on the first (1/st/),
third (3/rd/), fourth (4/th/), and fifth (5/th/) floors of the Building, and
approximately 4,379 net rentable square feet of support space located in the
Building's garage ("Garage Support Space") as depicted on the floor plans
attached to this Lease as Exhibit B, subject to recalculation in accordance with
Section 2. The Premises shall include the Tenant Improvements, if any, described
in Exhibit C.

               1.3.1.    Tenant's Use of Landlord's Generator. In addition to
the Premises described above, as of the Commencement Date, Tenant shall also
lease from Landlord, the generator ("Generator") located next door to the
Building in the P2 level of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Building, as further
illustrated on Exhibit B-6 attached hereto, Tenant's lease of the Generator
shall be on the following terms and conditions: Tenant's use of Landlord's
Generator shall be on a month-to-month basis, and is terminable at will by
either party upon twenty (20) days prior notice, and shall terminate in the
event of any default by Tenant under the Lease. Upon such termination, Landlord
may disconnect Tenant's use of Landlord's Generator without notice.

Landlord and Tenant each hereby acknowledge and agree that Tenant's use of
Landlord's Generator shall be limited to service of those existing electrical
panels that were previously serving the former tenant in a portion of Tenant's
Premises (The Biomembrane Institute) and no other load has been or may be
connected without Landlord's prior written approval. Tenant shall provide
Landlord, within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date of this Lease, a copy of
panel schedules indicating any and all loads, plus an estimate of full load amp
draw being provided by Landlord's Generator to Tenant's electrical panels. If
such information is not provided within such 90-day period, then Tenant's use of
Landlord's Generator shall terminate without further notice. Tenant further
acknowledges and agrees that its use of Landlord's Generator is subject to
existing load shedding capabilities, and Tenant understands and agrees that if
the actual electrical load being placed upon Landlord's Generator exceeds the
output capabilities, the load shedding equipment currently in place would then
proceed to reduce the load requirement by shutting down those power feeds
servicing the Premises. Landlord agrees that it will continue to maintain
Landlord's Generator consistent with past practices, and upon Tenant's request,
Landlord will provide copies of the service records.

Tenant further understands and agrees that Landlord does not warrant the
adequacy of Landlord's Generator for Tenant's needs or that the power available
from Landlord's Generator will be free from interruption. Except to the extent
caused by the gross negligence, or willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents,
contractors or invitees, interruption of service from Landlord's Generator or of
any power source shall not be

deemed an eviction or excuse for performance of any of Tenant's obligations
under this Lease or render Landlord liable for damages. Tenant further
acknowledges and agrees to assume full responsibility for all and shall, at its
option, take any additional precautions it deems necessary to insure that its
equipment being serviced by Landlord's Generator is adequately protected.

Except to the extent of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord
or its agents, contractors or invitees, Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold
Landlord harmless from and against any liabilities, obligations, damages, costs,
and expenses (including attorneys' fees incurred prior to trial, at trial and
upon appeal) incurred in connection with its use of Landlord's Generator, any
failure of Landlord's Generator to provide power to Tenant, and/or any damages
resulting to any of Tenant's equipment resulting from a failure of Landlord's
Generator to provide power to Tenant. This indemnity shall survive termination
of this Lease.

               1.3.2.    Installation of Tenant Generator. Tenant shall have the
right, at no additional Rent to Tenant, to install its own generator (with fuel
tank) in a mutually agreeable location, along with the conduit reasonably
necessary to connect to the Premises, subject to Landlord's prior written
approval as to the plans and specifications therefor, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. Throughout the term of the Lease, Tenant shall have
reasonable access to the generator in order to operate and maintain Tenant's
generator. The installation and operation shall be in compliance with all laws,
rules and regulations, as well as all of the terms and conditions of this Lease.

the Land other than the Building, are sometimes collectively referred to in this
Lease as the "Property".

2.   PREMISES. Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases from
Landlord, the Premises described in Section 1.3 and 1.3.1, together with the
tenant improvements described on Exhibit C ("Tenant Improvements") and together
with rights of ingress and egress over and nonexclusive use of public and common
areas in the Building and on the land legally described on Exhibit A, including
all easements pertinent to the land ("Land"). Tenant's lease of the Premises
shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease.

Landlord shall complete Landlord's Work, if any, in accordance with Exhibit C.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall provide
Landlord and Landlord's contractor with such access to the Premises as may be
required by Landlord and Landlord's contractor to efficiently perform Landlord's
Work. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have no obligation to
construct improvements in the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy except as
may be expressly set forth on Exhibit C.

     2.1.      Acceptance of Premises. Intentionally Deleted.

     2.2.      Relocation or Termination. Intentionally Deleted

     2.3.      Tenant's Right of First Refusal. During the term of the Lease,
Tenant shall have a right of first refusal (each, a "Right of First Refusal") to
lease any rentable area in the Building as portions of it become available from
time to time (each such portion being referred to herein as an "Additional
Space"), on the same terms and conditions that Landlord is prepared to accept
from any third party. When Landlord receives an offer to lease the Additional
Space from a third party which Landlord desires to accept, Landlord shall
present the same, in writing, to Tenant, and Tenant shall thereafter have ten
(10) days in which to accept or reject that offer by written notice to Landlord.
The Right of First Refusal shall apply only with respect to the entire
Additional Space subject of the third-party offer, and may not be exercised
with respect to only a portion thereof or for only a partial term. If Tenant
rejects that offer or fails to accept the same in writing within that time, then
Landlord shall be free to lease the Additional Space to the third party on
substantially similar terms and conditions to those offered to Tenant in the
foregoing manner.

Each Right of First Refusal shall, at Landlord's election, be null and void if
Tenant is in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods under the Lease
at the date Landlord would otherwise notify Tenant of the offer concerning the
Additional Space or at any time thereafter prior to commencement of the Lease
for the Additional Space. After Tenant validly exercises a Right of First
Refusal provided in this Lease, the parties shall execute an amendment to the
Lease adding the Additional Space, or a new lease for the Additional Space, or
such other documentation as Landlord shall require, promptly after Landlord
shall prepare the same, confirm the leasing of such Additional Space to Tenant,
but an otherwise valid exercise of the Right of First Refusal contained in this
Lease shall be fully effective, whether or not such confirmatory documentation
is executed.

If Tenant exercises a Right of First Refusal granted in this Lease, Landlord
does not guarantee that the Additional Space will be available on the
anticipated commencement date for the lease thereof if the then-existing
occupants of the Additional Space shall hold over, or for any other reason
beyond Landlord's reasonable control. Landlord, however, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver such Additional Space to Tenant on the anticipated
commencement or in the event of a hold over, as soon after the anticipated
commencement date as reasonably possible. In that event, and provided Landlord
uses such commercially reasonable efforts, Tenant's only recourse shall be that
(i) the rent with respect to the Additional Space shall be abated until Landlord
legally delivers the same to Tenant and (ii) Tenant shall have the right to
terminate the lease for the Additional Space thereof if delivery does not occur
within sixty (60) days of such anticipated commencement date. Tenant's exercise
of that Right of First Refusal shall not operate to cure any default by Tenant
of any of the terms or provisions in the Lease, nor to extinguish or impair any
rights or remedies of Landlord arising by virtue of such default. Each and all
Rights of First

Refusal are personal to Tenant and may not be exercised or enjoyed by any other
person or entity. If the Lease or Tenant's right to possession of the Premises
shall terminate in any manner whatsoever before Tenant shall exercise a Right of
First Refusal, or if Tenant shall have subleased or assigned its right to
possess more than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, then immediately upon
such termination, sublease, or assignment, the Right of First Refusal shall
simultaneously terminate and become null and void. Under no circumstances
whatsoever shall a subtenant under a sublease of the Premises, or the assignee
under a full or a partial assignment of the Lease, have any right to exercise a
Right of First Refusal granted in this Lease.

3.   LEASE TERM.

     3.1.      Duration of Lease Term. Tenant's lease of the Premises shall
commence on the Commencement Date and terminate on the Expiration Date or such
earlier or later date as may be provided for under this Lease.

     3.2.      Extension Option. Provided that Tenant has not been in default of
this Lease beyond any applicable cure period during the last thirty-six (36)
months of the Lease Term, Tenant shall have the option ("Option") to extend the
Term of this Lease for one (1) additional period of five (5) years (the "Option
Term") on the same terms and conditions of this Lease as are provided for in the
initial Term, except as provided below in this Section 3.2 or in Section 3.3 and
without any free rent periods or Tenant Improvement allowances. The Option Term
shall commence upon the date of expiration of the initial Term of this Lease. To
exercise its Option, Tenant must give written notice to Landlord that Tenant is
exercising its Option at least twelve (12) months before the date of expiration
of the initial Term. Once such notice is delivered to Landlord, such notice
shall be irrevocable by Tenant. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, the right to exercise
the Option shall not extend to any assignee or subtenant of Tenant (other than a
Permitted Transferee), and any attempt to exercise the Option by any such
assignee or subtenant (other than a Permitted Transferee), or by Tenant in
connection with such assigned or subleased space if such assigned or subleased
space exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, shall be deemed null and
void, except to a Permitted Transferee as defined in Section 15.

     3.3.      Base Rent During Option Term. In the event that Tenant elects to
exercise its Option to extend the term of this Lease in accordance with the
terms of Section 3.2, the Base Rent for the Option Term shall be equal to the
then-market rent for similarly improved space in comparable buildings in the
lower Queen Anne/Seattle bio-tech/office market. In analyzing comparable
transactions, all reasonable factors affecting rent shall be taken into
consideration, including, but not limited to, the building age, size, style and
condition the fact that there will be no free rent period or tenant improvement
allowance.

     If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the then-market rate for the Option
Term prior to one hundred eighty (180) days before Lease termination, then both
parties agree to use the appraisal process, outlined as follows: Each party will
hire an MAI appraiser. Each appraiser must have a minimum of five (5) years
appraisal experience in the lower Queen Anne/downtown Seattle area. Each
appraiser shall complete his/her appraisal within thirty (30) days. If the
appraisers' opinion of the market rate differs by less than ten percent (10%) of
the amount of the higher appraisal; then the market rate shall be the average of
the two appraisals. If the appraisers' opinion of market rate differs by more
than ten percent (10%) of the higher appraisal then a third MAI appraiser
satisfying the same qualifications shall be mutually hired and paid for by both
parties. The third appraiser will evaluate the market using the same parameters
outlined in the preceding paragraph. The market rate estimate of the third
appraiser shall be averaged with the market rate estimate of the appraiser
closest to it. The Base Rent for the Option Term shall be the higher of the
resultant average rent utilizing this process or the Base Rent being paid at the
time of the renewal.

     3.4.      Confirmation of Commencement Date. If the Commencement Date is
not the date indicated in Section 1.7, Landlord may confirm the Commencement
Date to Tenant in writing within a reasonable time after delivery of the
Premises in accordance with this Lease.

     3.5.      Surrender of Premises. Subject to Section 11, Tenant shall
promptly and peacefully surrender the Premises to Landlord upon the termination
of the Lease Term in as good a condition as when received by Tenant from
Landlord and/or as thereafter improved, if applicable, normal wear and tear and
damage from casualty or condemnation excepted. Unless Landlord expressly
provides otherwise in writing to Tenant, upon the expiration or termination of
this Lease, all improvements and alterations and equipment permanently affixed
to the Premises except those items set forth on Exhibit C-l shall be deemed
property of Landlord and shall not be removed by Tenant from the Premises.
Tenant shall be solely responsible for, and shall repair, all damage to the
Property arising out of its surrender of the Premises. In addition to all other
requirements under this Lease, Tenant shall remove any Hazardous Substances, as
such term is defined in Section 6.3, on the Premises which were placed on the
Premises by Tenant, its employees, agents, contractors and/or invitees, prior to
its surrender and vacation of the Premises.

     3.6.      Holding Over With Consent. If Tenant remains in possession of the
Premises after termination or expiration of the Lease Term with Landlord's
written permission, such tenancy shall be deemed a month-to-month tenancy, which
may be terminated by either party upon twenty (20) days' notice. During such
tenancy, Tenant shall be bound by all of the terms, covenants and conditions in
this Lease so far as applicable, except that the Base Rent shall be increased to
the greater of (i) the then-quoted rates for similar space in the Building or
(ii) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) multiplied by the sum of the monthly
installment of Base Rent and additional Rent payable for the last month of the
Lease Term.

     3.7.      Holding Over Without Consent. If Tenant remains in possession of
the Premises after the termination or expiration of the Lease Term without
Landlord's prior written consent, Tenant shall become a tenant at sufferance
only, subject to all the provisions of this Lease so far as applicable, except
that Base Rent shall be increased to an amount equal to one hundred fifty
percent (150%) multiplied by the sum of the monthly installments of Base Rent
payable by Tenant during the last month of the Lease Term, prorated on a daily
basis. Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after the termination of the Lease Term
shall not result in a renewal or extension of this Lease. The provisions of
Section 3.6 and this Section 3.7 are in addition to, and shall not act as a
waiver of or otherwise affect, Landlord's right of re-entry or any other rights
of Landlord under this Lease or as provided by law or in equity. If Tenant fails
to surrender the Premises upon the termination of the Lease Term, despite
Landlord's demand to do so, Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord
harmless from and against all loss and liability, including, without limitation,
any claim made by any succeeding tenant founded on, or resulting from, such
failure to surrender, including without limitation, any attorneys' fees or costs
associated therewith.

4.   RENT.

     4.1.      Payment. Tenant shall pay Landlord the monthly installments of
Base Rent provided in Section 1.10,1.10.1,1.10.2 and Additional Rent provided in
Section 1.12 in lawful money of the United States, in advance, on the
Commencement Date and thereafter on or before the first day of each month
throughout the Lease Term. Base Rent and Additional Rent shall be paid by Tenant
without notice or demand, deduction, abatement, or offset, except as expressly
provided herein. Base Rent and Additional Rent for any partial month at the
beginning or end of the Lease Term shall be prorated in proportion to the number
of days in such month. Base Rent and Additional Rent are collectively referred
to in this Lease as "Rent."

               4.1.1.    Wire Payments. Any amounts payable to Landlord under
this Lease in excess of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00)
per occurrence shall be made by wire transfer as follows:

Bank: The Commerce Bank of Washington, 601 Union St., Suite 3600, Seattle, WA

12201 Tukwila International Blvd., Fourth Floor, Seattle, WA 98168-5121.

     4.2.      Interest on Late Payments; Late Charge. If any Base Rent or
Additional Rent is not paid on the due date thereof: (i) such overdue amounts
shall bear interest at a rate equal to fifteen percent (15%) per annum; and (ii)
Tenant shall pay Landlord a late charge equal to three percent (3%) of such
overdue amount. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair
and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late
payment by Tenant, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain.
Acceptance by Landlord of any partial amounts due under this Section 4 shall in
no event constitute a waiver of Tenant's default with respect to any overdue
amount, nor prevent Landlord from exercising any of its other rights and
remedies granted under this Lease or by law or in equity.

     4.3.      Address for Payments. Tenant shall pay all Rent to Landlord at
Landlord's Payment Address, or at such other place as may be designated by
Landlord from time to time by written notice to Tenant.

5.   SECURITY DEPOSIT. Intentionally Deleted.

6.   USES; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

     6.1.      Permitted Uses. The Premises are to be used only for the
Permitted Uses, and for no other business or purpose without the prior written
consent of Landlord, which consent may be withheld if Landlord, in its
reasonable discretion, determines that any proposed use is inconsistent with or
detrimental to the maintenance and operation of the Building as a similar
bio-tech/office building or is inconsistent with any restriction on use of the
Property contained in any lease, mortgage or other agreement or instrument by
which the Landlord may be bound or to which any of the Property may be subject.

     6.2.      Duties and Prohibited Conduct. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall not knowingly commit any act that will
increase the then-existing rate of insurance on the Building without Landlord's
prior written consent. Tenant shall promptly pay upon demand the amount of any
increase in insurance rates caused by the Permitted Uses or by any act or acts
of Tenant or its employees, agents or representatives. Tenant shall not commit
or allow to be committed any waste upon the Premises, or any public or private
nuisance or other act which disturbs the quiet enjoyment of any other tenant of
the Property or which is unlawful. Tenant shall not, without the written consent
of Landlord, use any apparatus, machinery or device in or about the Premises, or
act in any way, which will cause any substantial noise, or any vibration, fumes,
or releases of Hazardous Substances into the surrounding environment. If any of
Tenant's office machines, equipment or activities should disturb the quiet
enjoyment of any other tenant in the Building, cause any substantial noise, or
cause any vibration, fumes or releases of Hazardous Substances, then Tenant, at
Tenant's sole expense, shall provide adequate insulation or take such other
action as may be necessary to eliminate such disturbance, noise, vibration,
fumes or releases. Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall comply with all laws,
rules, regulations, orders, ordinances and permits relating to the Premises, or
its use or occupancy of the Premises, and shall observe such reasonable rules
and regulations as may be adopted by Landlord and made available to Tenant from
time to time. This Lease shall be subject to all applicable zoning ordinances
and to all municipal, county, state and federal laws and regulations governing
or regulating the use of the Premises.

     6.3.      Environmental, Health And Safety Laws. Without limiting Tenant's
obligations under this Section 6, Tenant in the exercise of its rights and the
performance of

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                        8

<PAGE>

its obligations under this Lease shall comply, at Tenant's expense, with all
local, state, or federal laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, orders and
permits now existing, or as hereafter enacted, amended, or issued concerning
environmental, health, or safety matters (collectively, the "Environmental
Laws") in connection with Tenant's use, generation, transportation, management,
handling, treatment, storage, manufacture, emission, release, disposal or
deposit of any radioactive material, hazardous or toxic wastes, hazardous or
toxic substances, any material containing hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances (except as they occur in normal office products or household cleaning
products), or any other pollutant, contaminant, human pathogen or infectious
agent as such terms may now or in the future be defined in any Environmental
Laws (collectively, "Hazardous Substances"), on the Property, adjacent surface
waters, soils, underground waters, or air. Tenant shall have the right to use
and store, in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, Hazardous
Substances reasonably necessary for the operation of Tenant's business.

Landlord shall have the right at all reasonable times upon at least three (3)
business days prior written notice to Tenant to conduct environmental
investigations, including the taking of samples, for the purpose of detecting or
measuring the presence of Hazardous Substances on the Property. Tenant shall
keep Landlord continuously informed by written notice of all Hazardous
Substances, which Tenant, or Tenant's employees, agents, representatives,
invitees, licensees, or contractors, generates, stores or otherwise allows on
the Property. Tenant shall provide Landlord with copies of all documents
received or prepared by Tenant concerning any release of a Hazardous Substance
at the Property by Tenant, all documents Tenant receives or prepares in
connection with any violation, or alleged violation, of an Environmental Law by
Tenant, and at Landlord's request, all reports or other documents Tenant is
required to provide any governmental authority under any Environmental Law
concerning any Hazardous Substance. Upon request by Landlord, Tenant shall
provide Landlord with all other information in Tenant's possession, which
Landlord reasonably deems necessary or useful for the purpose of determining
whether Tenant is in compliance with all Environmental Laws and whether the
Property, or any part of the Property, is contaminated by any Hazardous
Substances. If Tenant or the Premises, as a result of Tenant's, its employees,
agents, contractors or visitors use of Hazardous Substances, is in violation of
any Environmental Law, or in the event Tenant, Tenant's employees, agents,
contractors or visitors releases Hazardous Substances into or on the Property or
adjacent surface waters, soils, underground waters, or air in violation of
Environmental Laws, Tenant shall (i) immediately notify Landlord in writing of
such occurrence and the action necessary to correct or mitigate such occurrence,
and (ii) take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct such violation
or release. Provided, however, Landlord reserves the right, but not the
obligation, to enter the Premises, to act in place of the Tenant (and Tenant
hereby appoints Landlord as its agent for such purposes) and to take such action
as Landlord reasonably deems necessary to ensure such compliance or to mitigate
such violation, at Tenant's expense. In the event there is a violation of
Environmental Law in an adjacent premises in the Building, then Tenant shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the migration of any Hazardous
Substances from such adjacent premises to the Premises; provided, however,
Tenant shall not be required to spend more than a nominal sum in so doing. If
Tenant is in violation of any Environmental Law, Landlord reserves the right to
enter the Premises with respect to such potential or actual release or violation
and take such corrective or mitigating action as Landlord reasonably deems
necessary to correct such violation by Tenant. All costs and expenses incurred
by Landlord in connection with any such actions shall become immediately due and
payable by Tenant upon presentation of an invoice therefore to the extent of
Tenant's violation of Environmental Law.

Other than testing in the ordinary course of Tenant's operations, Tenant shall
not conduct or permit others to conduct environmental testing on the Premises
without first obtaining Landlord's written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Landlord does not deliver such reasonable
consent within five (5) days from receipt of Tenant's request, such consent will
be deemed provided. Tenant shall promptly inform Landlord of the existence of
any environmental study, evaluation, investigation or results of any
environmental testing conducted on the Premises whenever the same becomes known

to Tenant and Tenant shall provide copies to Landlord, upon request by Landlord
and at no cost to Landlord.

Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord's subsidiaries and parent corporations, shareholders,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, partners, affiliates, and
agents from, any claims, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or suffered
arising in connection with any Hazardous Substances which are brought or allowed
on the Premises or the Property by Tenant, Tenant's employees, or its agents,
contractors or invitees, including remedial or enforcement actions of any kind
and administrative or judicial proceedings, orders or judgments, damages
(including consequential and punitive damages), and costs (including attorney,
consultant, and expert fees and expenses) resulting from such release or
violation by Tenant, Tenant's employees, or its agents, contractors or invitees.

To the best knowledge of Landlord, (a) no Hazardous Substance is present in the
Building or on the Property or the soil, surface water or groundwater thereof,
(b) no underground storage tanks are present on the Property, and (c) no action,
proceeding or claim is pending or threatened regarding the Building or the
Property concerning any Hazardous Substance or pursuant to any Environmental
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Tenant be responsible for
or liable to Landlord for any Hazardous Substances located in the Premises that
existed or were released upon the Premises prior to the Commencement Date of
this Lease, or that were not released by Tenant, Tenant's employees,
contractors, visitors, or invitees.

Landlord shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Tenant, its agents,
contractors, stockholders, directors, successors, representatives, and assigns
from and against, all losses, costs, claims, liabilities and damages (including
attorneys' and consultants' fees) of every type and nature, directly or
indirectly arising out of or in connection with any Hazardous Substance present
at any time on or about the Premises prior to the Commencement Date, the
Building or the Property, or the soil, air, improvements, groundwater or surface
water thereof, or the violation of any laws, orders or regulations, relating to
any such Hazardous Substance, except to the extent that any of the foregoing
actually results from the release or emission of Hazardous Substances by Tenant,
Tenant's employees, contractors visitors, or its agents in violation of
applicable Environmental Laws.

In particular, Landlord shall be responsible for keeping the Building in
compliance with Environmental Laws with respect to asbestos and asbestos
containing materials.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Tenant's and Landlord's
indemnity obligations with respect to Hazardous Substances pursuant to this
Paragraph 6.3 shall survive any expiration or any termination of this Lease.

This Section 6.3 constitutes the entire agreement of Landlord and Tenant
regarding Hazardous Materials and Environmental Laws. No other provision of the
Lease shall be deemed to apply thereto.

7.   SERVICES AND UTILITIES; REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.

     7.1.      Services and Utilities; Landlord's Obligations. Landlord warrants

applicable, water sufficient for standard office use (including convenience
electricity for lighting and operation of low power usage office machines of
three (3) watts per usable square foot), the cost of which shall be paid by the
Tenant in accordance with Section 8.2. HVAC service will be limited to 7:00 a.m.

shall supply Landlord's standard Building and Property security and fire
monitoring services and elevator service, Landlord's standard trash removal
services (excluding disposal of Hazardous Substances or medical or biological
waste) from the Building compactor, if any, bulb replacement services for
Building standard light fixtures, and Landlord's standard exterior window
washing services for Premises' windows. Landlord shall also provide standard
office janitorial services to the Premises if so requested by Tenant.

Any service or utility, which is separately metered to the Premises by the
utility provider shall be billed directly to Tenant and paid directly by Tenant
to the utility provider. The Base rental rate excludes the cost of janitorial
services to the Premises, and utilities to the Premises including the estimated
utilities to supply the Premises with building standard HVAC. All other services
or utilities which are required to be provided by Landlord under Section 7.1
which are not separately metered by the service or utility provider shall be
included within "Operating Costs" and shall be paid by Tenant each month as
provided in Section 8. The cost for any services or utilities, which are not
separately metered or sub-metered shall be based on Landlord's reasonable
estimate of Tenant's consumption of such utilities. If in the Landlord's
reasonable opinion the Tenant's consumption of any utility is extraordinary,
Landlord shall be entitled to install, maintain and operate, at Tenant's cost, a
monitoring/ metering system(s) in the Premises to measure Tenant's consumption
of water, electricity (including electricity to Tenant's signage, if any) HVAC
or other utilities or services, or to measure the added demands on the Premises
electrical or HVAC systems resulting from Tenant's equipment or lights,
including without limitation, Tenant's improvements pursuant to Exhibit C.

Landlord's obligation to provide the services and utilities described in this
Section 7.1 is subject to Section 11 (Damage And Destruction) and Section 22
(Condemnation).

               7.1.1.    Additional Services Or Utilities. The Building standard
mechanical system is designed to accommodate standard office use heating loads
generated by lights or equipment using up to three (3) watts per usable square
foot. Before installing fixtures, lights or equipment in the Premises, which in
the aggregate exceed such amount, or which otherwise consume or require services
or utilities exceeding standard office-type levels, Tenant shall obtain the
written permission of Landlord. Landlord may refuse to grant such permission
unless Tenant agrees to pay Landlord's costs, including Landlord's
administrative fee, for installation of supplementary air conditioning capacity
or electrical systems as necessitated by such equipment or lights. In addition,
Tenant shall pay Landlord as Additional Rent the amount estimated by Landlord
(including Landlord's administrative fee) as the cost of furnishing services or
utilities for the operation of such equipment or lights and the cost of
operation and maintenance of any supplementary air conditioning units
necessitated by Tenant's use of such equipment or lights.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled to the use of all
electrical and mechanical systems currently being used in the Premises
including, without limitation, the electricity necessary to power such systems.

During other than normal business hours (7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., weekdays),
Landlord may restrict access to the Building in accordance with the Building's
security system, provided that Tenant shall have at all times during the Term of
this Lease (24 hours of all days) reasonable access to the Premises.

If after request by Tenant, Landlord furnishes HVAC or other services or
utilities in addition to the utilities or services required to be provided by
Landlord under this Lease, including without limitation, furnishing utilities or
services at times other than Normal Business Hours or in amounts exceeding
standard office use, then the cost of such non-standard or additional services
or utilities, as reasonably established by Landlord, shall be paid by Tenant as
Additional Rent.

     7.2.      Services and Utilities; Tenant's Obligations. Tenant shall be
solely responsible for providing, and shall pay directly, all charges for
janitorial services to the

Premises and for any security services desired by Tenant in addition to
Landlord's standard Building and site security services. Tenant shall be solely
responsible for providing, at Tenant's cost, any backup electricity generator
desired by Tenant. It is understood that except as provided in Sections 7.1 or
7.4, Landlord shall not be required to provide any services or utilities to
Tenant, and Tenant shall make all necessary arrangements to have such services
and utilities billed directly to Tenant and paid directly by Tenant. Tenant
shall pay its share, as reasonably determined by Landlord, of any unique
services or equipment used by Tenant, which are shared by other tenants of the
Building, such as generators, dilution tanks and air compressors.

               7.2.1.    Laboratory Systems and Services. Throughout the Term of
this Lease, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall maintain its separate
and exclusive exhausting, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system for
the Premises. The electricity used in the Premises for such system shall be
separately metered from an electrical panel and meter in the basement of the
Building and billed directly to Tenant by Seattle City Light. The cost of such
separate meter shall be paid by Tenant.

               7.2.2.    Boiler Room Expenses. Landlord's and Tenant's
respective responsibilities with regard to the boiler facilities in the are set
forth in that certain letter agreement dated November 6, 1992, attached hereto
as Exhibit F.

     7.3.      Interruption. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, injury
or damage to persons or property caused by or resulting from any variation,
interruption, or failure of services or utilities to be provided by Landlord
under this Lease due to any cause whatsoever, except for loss, injury or damage
caused by the gross negligence, negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or
its agents, contractors or invitees. No temporary variation, interruption or
failure of services or utilities to be provided by Landlord under this Lease
incident to the making of repairs, alterations or improvements, or due to
accident, strike or conditions or events beyond Landlord's reasonable control,
shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant or relieve Tenant from any of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease.

     7.4.      Landlord's Repair and Maintenance Obligations. Except as provided
in Sections 9 (Improvements and Alterations by Tenant), 11 (Damage or
Destruction) or 22 (Condemnation), Landlord shall cause to be maintained in
reasonably good order and condition the Building (other than the nonstructural
portions of any leased premises) including, without limitation, the Building's
mechanical and electrical systems, the roof, the foundations, the exterior walls
and the public and common areas of the Property, such as lobbies, elevators,
stairs, corridors and restrooms; provided, however, Tenant shall be responsible
for the cost of repair of damage occasioned by any negligent act or omission of
Tenant or Tenant's officers, contractors, agents, invitees, licensees or
employees, subject to Section 12, Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord shall maintain
and repair the Premises' water, if applicable, and elevator service at all times
during the term of the Lease.

     7.5.      Tenant's Repair and Maintenance Obligations. Except for
maintenance, replacements and repairs required to be made or provided by
Landlord under Sections 7.1 or 7.4, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall
provide for the maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendations, repair and replacement within the Premises and all built-in
appliances and equipment, including any private restrooms and associated
plumbing, which are in the Premises for Tenant's exclusive use and any security
systems or services desired by Tenant in addition to any such systems or
services as may be provided by Landlord under this Lease, reasonable wear and
tear and damage from casualty or condemnation excepted.

     7.6.      Additional Security. In the event that Tenant's use of the
Premises, or its presence in the Building, results in the need for additional
security for the Premises or the Building, as determined by Landlord, then any
additional security provided by Landlord for the Building or the Premises shall
be at Tenant's sole cost and expense, and shall be reimbursed by Tenant to
Landlord within five (5) days of written demand. This Section shall include,
without limitation, any additional security required as a result of labor

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       12

<PAGE>

disturbances, strikes, political protests, dangerous activities, and any other
disturbance or disruption of any kind.

     7.7.      Tenant's Obligations. When performing its obligations under this
Section 7, Tenant shall do so, at Tenant's expense in accordance with all
Environmental Laws and all other applicable laws, ordinances, codes, orders,
rules or regulations of any governmental authority. Tenant shall provide
Landlord upon request, a list of Tenant's maintenance and service providers with
respect to its obligations under this Section 7. Except as provided in Section 9
in connection with Alterations, before making or performing any work, repairs,
or replacement of any kind in the Premises, if such work shall affect the
Building's systems or costs of operation to Landlord then Tenant shall obtain
Landlord's prior written approval, which approval may be conditioned on Tenant
providing Landlord with plans and specifications therefore, if applicable, which
are reasonably acceptable to Landlord. All work, maintenance, repairs and
replacements by Tenant under this Lease shall be performed by licensed and
reputable contractors reasonably acceptable to Landlord in a good and
workmanlike manner. Before installing any heavy building mechanical equipment or
fixtures in the Premises, Tenant shall submit the plans and specifications
therefore to Landlord for Landlord's written approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

8.   ADDITIONAL RENT: OPERATING COSTS AND REAL ESTATE TAXES.

     8.1.      Definitions. In addition to the Base Rent, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord each month as Additional Rent Tenant's Share of Taxes and of Operating

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

<PAGE>

Landlord's insurance (including applicable interest charges), insurance
deductibles, licenses, permits and inspection fees, a management fee, reasonable
legal, administrative and accounting expenses, and any other expense or charge
whether or not hereinabove described, which in accordance with generally
accepted management practices would be considered an expense of maintaining,
operating, or repairing the Property, excluding or deducting, as appropriate
costs of any special services rendered to individual tenants (including Tenant)
for which a special charge is collected including, without limitation, any
specially metered charges. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operating Costs shall
not include the following:

(1)  attorney's fees, accounting fees and other expenditures incurred in
connection with negotiations, disputes and claims of other tenants or occupants
of the Building, except as specifically otherwise provided in this Lease;

(2)  costs directly attributable to or for the sole benefit of a tenant,
including Tenant;

(3)  rental on ground leases or other underlying leases;

(4)  cost of any work or services to the extent performed for any facility other
than the Building (provided Landlord shall have the right to reasonably allocate
the cost of services provided to more than one facility);

(5)  costs due to Landlord's willful violation of any governmental rule or
authority;

(6)  charitable or political contributions;

(7)  any fees paid to related parties of Landlord which exceed the market rate
for similar services;

(8)  costs of electricity to other tenants' premises;

(9)  costs occasioned by casualty or by the exercise of the power of eminent
domain;

(10) costs to correct any construction defect in the Premises or the Property or

(14) costs which could properly be capitalized under generally accepted

               8.1.3.    Tenant's Share. "Tenant's Share" in connection with
Operating Costs and Taxes shall mean Tenant's Share of the Property multiplied
by actual or estimated, as the case may be, Operating Costs or Taxes allocated
to the Property, respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 8.1.3, in determining the amount of Operating Costs, for the purpose of
this Section 8.1.3: if less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Building shall
have been occupied by tenants and fully used by them at any time, Operating
Costs which vary by level of occupancy shall be increased to an amount equal to
the like Operating Costs which would normally be expected to be incurred had

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       14

<PAGE>

such occupancy been ninety five percent (95%) and had such full utilization by
tenants been made during the entire period; and (b) if the Landlord is not
furnishing any particular work or service (the cost of which if performed by the
Landlord would constitute an Operating Cost) to a tenant other than Tenant, who
has undertaken to perform such work or service in lieu of the performance
thereof by the Landlord, Operating Costs shall be deemed for the purposes of
Section 8.1.2 to be increased by an amount equal to the additional Operating
Costs which would reasonably have been incurred during such period by the
Landlord if it had at its own cost furnished such work or service to such
tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.1.3 shall not be construed
to require that the Tenant incur an expense twice for the same service or incur
an expense for a service which is not provided to Tenant.

     8.2.      Payment of Additional Rent for Estimated Operating Costs and
Taxes. Within thirty (30) days of the Commencement Date or the close of each
Lease Year, as applicable, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, Landlord
shall provide Tenant with a written statement of Tenant's Share of estimated
Operating Costs and Taxes for such Lease Year. Tenant shall pay 1/12 of the
amount of any special or specific Tenant charges, and Tenant's Share of
Operating Costs and Taxes as Additional Rent as provided in Section 4 each month
during such Lease Year and until such time as Landlord provides Tenant with a
statement of estimated Operating Costs and Taxes for the subsequent Lease Year.
If at any time or times during such Lease Year, it appears to Landlord that
Tenant's Share of actual Operating Costs and/or actual Taxes will vary from the
estimated Operating Costs and/or Taxes by more than five percent (5%) on an
annual basis, Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant, revise its estimate for
such Lease Year and Additional Rent payable by Tenant under this Section 8.2 for
such Lease Year shall be increased based on Landlord's revised estimate.

     8.3.      Actual Operating Costs and Taxes. Landlord will make reasonable
efforts within ninety (90) days after the close of each Lease Year during the
Term hereof for which an estimated statement was delivered to Tenant pursuant to
Section 8.2, to deliver to Tenant a written statement ("Reconciliation
Statement") setting forth Tenant's Share of the actual Operating Costs and Taxes
paid or incurred by Landlord during the preceding Lease Year (or such prorated
portion of such Lease Year if this Lease commences or terminates on a day other
than the first or last day of a Lease Year, based on a 365-day Lease Year). If
the actual Operating Costs and/or Taxes shown on the Reconciliation Statement
for any Lease Year exceed estimated Operating Costs and/or Taxes paid by Tenant
to Landlord pursuant to Section 8.2, Tenant shall pay the excess to Landlord as
Additional Rent within thirty (30) days after the date of the Reconciliation
Statement. If the Reconciliation Statement shows that actual Operating Costs
and/or Taxes are less than the estimated Operating Costs and/or Taxes paid by
Tenant to Landlord pursuant to Section 8.2, then the amount of such overpayment
shall be credited by Landlord to the next Base Rent and Additional Rent payable
by Tenant (or refunded to Tenant in the event of the termination or expiration
of this Lease). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.3,
Tenant's Share of Operating Costs and Taxes for any partial Lease Year at the
end of the Term shall be as shown on Landlord's statement of estimated Operating
Costs and Taxes furnished to Tenant pursuant to Section 8.2.

     8.4.      Determinations. The determination of actual and estimated
Operating Costs and Taxes shall be made by Landlord. Landlord or its agent shall
keep records in reasonable detail showing all expenditures made for the items
enumerated in this Section 8. Tenant shall have the right at its own cost and
expense to review and/or inspect Landlord's records once in any calendar year
with respect to any Operating Costs shown on Landlord's annual reconciliation
statement provided to Tenant. This review/inspection right is limited solely to
the prior calendar year based upon the date Tenant provides written notice to
Landlord. Tenant shall give Landlord written notice ("Tenant's Notice") of its
intention to conduct any such review or inspection on or before sixty (60) days
after the date of Tenant's receipt of Landlord's annual reconciliation
statement. Tenant's review/inspection shall be conducted by a certified public
accounting firm at Landlord's main business office, or at

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       15

<PAGE>

such other location as Landlord may keep its relevant business records, and on a
date mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant, but in no event is Landlord
required to agree to a date which is earlier than sixty (60) days from the date
of Tenant's Notice to Landlord. Landlord agrees that it shall give Tenant said
access to review/inspect the business records no later than seventy-five (75)
days after Tenant's Notice to Landlord. Tenant must provide written notice to
Landlord within sixty (60) days after Tenant's review or inspection specifying
any and all claims it may have determined in good faith. Tenant agrees to
diligently pursue its review/inspection of Landlord's records in order to
determine if it concurs or disagrees with Landlord's statement.

Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its review and inspection right, and
therefore agree with Landlord's changes, with respect to the period of time
covered in Landlord's annual reconciliation statement if any of the following
occurs:

     (a) Tenant has not notified Landlord in writing on or before sixty (60)
         days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's annual reconciliation
         statement of its intention to conduct its review/inspection,

     (b) Tenant has not commenced its review/inspection of Landlord's records at
         Landlord's office or designated location on or before ninety (90) days
         after Tenant's Notice to Landlord unless due to a delay by Landlord in
         providing Tenant with access to such records,

     (c) Tenant has not provided written notice to Landlord on or before sixty
         (60) days after Tenant's review/inspection specifying any and all
         claims it may have determined in good faith.

Tenant, and its employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives
agree that any and all information concerning Operating Costs or any other
information disclosed by Landlord pursuant to any such review/inspection shall
not be disclosed to any other person or entity without the prior written consent
of Landlord, which consent shall be at Landlord's sole discretion. Prior to
providing such confidential information to any of Tenant's employees, agents,
attorneys, accountants or representatives, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a
written acknowledgment of such parties' agreement to be bound by the terms of
this paragraph, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. Nothing in this
paragraph shall relieve Tenant of its obligation under Section 8 to pay
Additional Rent without notice, demand, offset or deduction.

Tenant shall bear the cost of such audit, unless such audit discloses that
Landlord has overstated the total costs by more than five percent (5%) of the
actual amount of such costs, in which event Landlord shall pay the actual and
reasonable costs of Tenant's audit. Landlord shall promptly refund any
overcharges to Tenant.

     8.5.      Tenant's Personal Property Taxes. Tenant shall pay prior to
delinquency all Personal Property Taxes payable with respect to all Property of
Tenant located on the Premises or the Property and, upon Landlord's request,
shall promptly provide Landlord with written proof of such payment. Solely for
purposes of this Section 8.5, "Property of Tenant" shall include Tenant
Improvements and all other improvements which are paid for by Tenant, and
"Personal Property Taxes" shall include all property taxes assessed against the
Property of Tenant, whether assessed as real or personal property.

     8.6.      Tenant's Utility Charges. Landlord and Tenant agree that
utilities to the Premises including the cost of utilities to provide Building
standard HVAC are not included in the Base Rent. Landlord will estimate, by
meter if possible, the cost of the Tenant's usage of electricity and natural gas
for its Premises, including the cost of utilities to heat and cool the Premises.
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord as Additional Rent each month the Landlord's
estimate of such charges. At the end of each calendar year the Landlord shall
compare the previous 12 months actual charges to its estimates. Any amounts
owing shall

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       16

<PAGE>

be paid by Tenant, and credit amounts shall be refunded to Tenant in accordance
with Section 8.3. Landlord shall adjust its estimates as provided for in Section
8.2.

9.   IMPROVEMENTS AND ALTERATIONS BY TENANT. Landlord grants Tenant the right to
modify existing office and laboratories including, but not limited to the
addition of chemistry capacity, in accordance with the terms below. Tenant shall
not make any changes, alterations, additions or improvements in or to the
Premises ("Alterations"), including, without limitation, changes to locks on
doors or to plumbing, without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and, where reasonably
required by Landlord, such Alterations shall be made under the supervision of a
competent architect and/or a licensed structural engineer, and in accordance
with plans and specifications (where plans and specifications are required)
which meet current building standards for quality, design, and colors if visible
from the hallways or exterior, approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Prior to commencing any Alterations, Tenant shall notify
Landlord of such work and Landlord shall perform a good faith asbestos
inspection in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Tenant agrees
that Sabey Construction Inc. will have a right of refusal at the agreed upon
fee, to be the contractor for any and all Alterations for which Tenant chooses
to employ a general contractor, provided that Elliott Park LLC remains the
Landlord, in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the
Construction Contract in Exhibit C attached hereto. All work with respect to any
Alterations shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and shall be
diligently prosecuted to completion. In no event shall Tenant's Alterations
change or affect the strength, exterior appearance, roof, or the mechanical,
electrical, or plumbing services or systems, of the Building without Landlord's
reasonable consent. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for any sums
reasonable expended by Landlord for examination and approval of plans and
specifications for any and all Alterations. Tenant shall also pay Landlord a sum
equal to the costs incurred by Landlord during any inspection or supervision of
any and all Alterations. All damages or injury to the Property caused by any
negligent act or omission of Tenant, or Tenant's officers, contractors, agents,
invitees, licensees or employees, or by any persons who may be in or upon the
Property with the express or implied consent of Tenant, in connection with such
Alterations; including but not limited to, damage from cracked or broken glass
in windows or doors, shall be paid by Tenant upon demand by Landlord. Tenant and
Tenant's contractor shall comply with the general conditions for construction as
referenced in Exhibit C.

10.  ACCESS. During other than Normal Business Hours, Landlord may restrict
access to the Building in accordance with a Landlord provided Building security
system. Tenant shall have at all times during the Lease Term (24 hours of all
days) reasonable access to the Premises. Landlord, at Tenant's cost, shall
provide Tenant with security access cards to the Building for the Building's
security system. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant has cards to date and will
not be charged for previous cards provided. Tenant shall permit Landlord and its
agents to enter the Premises at all reasonable times (except in cases of
emergency) for the purpose of inspecting or improving the Premises or the
Building or for performing any of its obligations under this Lease, upon at
least one (1) business days' prior notice to Tenant. Nothing contained in this
Section 10 shall be deemed to impose any obligation upon Landlord not expressly
stated elsewhere in this Lease. When reasonably necessary Landlord may
temporarily close entrances, doors, corridors, elevators or other facilities
without liability to Tenant by reason of such closure and without such action by
Landlord being construed as an eviction of Tenant or release of Tenant from the
duty of observing and performing any of the provisions of this Lease, so long as
such action does not materially and unreasonably interfere with Tenant's access
to the leased Premises. Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises for
the purpose of showing the Premises to prospective tenants within the period of
one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration or sooner termination of
the Lease Term. Landlord shall have the right at all times to enter the
Premises, with at lease one (1) business days' notice to Tenant, for the purpose
of showing the Premises to prospective purchasers or lenders. Any entry by
Landlord or its agents hereunder shall comply with Tenant's reasonable security
measures.

11.  DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.

     11.1.     Damage and Repair. If the Building is damaged by fire or any
other cause to such extent that the cost of restoration, as estimated by
Landlord, will equal or exceed thirty percent (30%) of the replacement value of
the Building (exclusive of foundations) just prior to the occurrence of the
damage, or if insurance proceeds sufficient for restoration are for any reason
unavailable, then Landlord may no later than the ninetieth (90th) day following
the damage, give Tenant a notice of its election to terminate this Lease. In the
event of such election; (a) this Lease shall be deemed to terminate on the date
that is thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's receipt of such notice
("Termination Date"); (b) Tenant shall surrender possession of the Premises on
the Termination Date; and (c) Rent and Additional Rent shall be apportioned as
of the date of Tenant's surrender and any Rent paid for any period beyond such
date shall be repaid to Tenant. If the cost of restoration as estimated by
Landlord shall amount to less than thirty percent (30%) of said replacement
value of the Building or Property and insurance proceeds sufficient for
restoration are available, or if Landlord does not elect to terminate this
Lease, Landlord shall restore the Building and the Premises (to the extent of
the improvements to the Premises originally provided by Landlord hereunder but
excluding any improvements paid for by Landlord with any tenant allowance or
credits) with reasonable promptness, subject to delays beyond Landlord's control
and delays in the making of insurance adjustments by Landlord, and Tenant shall
have no right to terminate this Lease except as provided in this Section 11. To
the extent that the Premises are rendered untenantable by such damage or by
Landlord's restoration work under this Section, the Base Rent (but not
Additional Rent) shall proportionately abate, provided, however, in the event
such damage resulted from or was contributed to, directly or indirectly, by the
act, fault or neglect of Tenant, Tenant's officers, contractors, agents,
employees, invitees or licensees, Base Rent shall abate only to the extent
Landlord receives proceeds from any rental income insurance policy received by
Landlord for loss of Rent under this Lease.

     11.2.     Destruction During Last Year of Term. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Lease, in case the Building shall be substantially
destroyed by fire or other cause at any time during the last Lease Year of this
Lease (as extended), either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon
written notice to the other given within thirty (30) days of the date of such
destruction.

     11.3.     Business Interruption. No damages, compensation or claim shall be
payable by Landlord for inconvenience, loss of business or annoyance arising
from any damage or destruction, repair or restoration of any portion of the
Premises or the Building. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to effect such
repairs promptly.

     11.4.     Tenant Improvements. Landlord will not carry insurance of any
kind on any improvements or alterations paid for by Tenant under this Lease or
paid for pursuant to any tenant allowance or credits from Landlord, or on
Tenant's furniture, furnishings, fixtures, equipment or appurtenances of Tenant
under this Lease and Landlord shall not be obligated to repair any damage
thereto or replace the same. Tenant shall insure its improvements in accordance
with Section 14.2 and proceeds of such insurance shall be used in any repair or
restoration of the Premises.

     11.5.     Express Agreement. The provisions of this Section 11 shall be
considered an express agreement governing any case of damage or destruction of
the Building or Premises by fire or other casualty.

12.  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Lease, whether loss or damage is due to the negligence of either Landlord or
Tenant, their agents or employees, or any other cause, Landlord and Tenant do
each hereby release and relieve the other, their agents or employees, from
responsibility for, and waive their entire claim of recovery for, (i) any loss
or damage to the real or personal property of either party located anywhere on
the Property, including the Building itself, arising out of or incident to the
occurrence of any of the perils which are covered, or are required to be covered
under

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       18

<PAGE>

this Lease, by their respective property and related insurance policies, and
(ii) any loss resulting from business interruption at the Premises or loss of
rental income from the Building, arising out of or incident to the occurrence of
any of the perils covered by any business interruption insurance policy, or by
any loss of rental income insurance policy, which may be held by Landlord or
Tenant. Each party shall cause its insurance carriers to consent to the
foregoing waiver of rights of subrogation against the other party.

13.  INDEMNIFICATION. Landlord shall not be liable for, and Tenant shall defend
(unless Landlord waives its right to such defense, and in any event with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord), indemnify, hold harmless and protect
Landlord and its employees and agents from any claim, demand, liability,
judgment, award, fine, mechanics' lien or other lien, loss, damage, expense,
penalty, charge or cost of any kind or character (including actual attorney fees
and court costs) which may be made, incurred or asserted by Tenant, Tenant's
agents or employees, contractors, or any third parties (including but not
limited to Landlord's agents, servants or employees), arising directly or
indirectly from: (a) the construction, repair, alteration, improvement, use,
occupancy or enjoyment of the Premises by Tenant its contractors, agents,
employees and/or customers, licensees, or invitees(a) injury to, or death of,
any person or persons or damage to, or destruction of, any property occurring
in, on or about the Premises, unless it is the result of Landlord's gross
negligence, negligence or willful misconduct or the gross negligence, negligence
or willful misconduct of its agents, contractors or invitees or (b) Tenant's
breach of this Lease or the negligent acts or omissions of Tenant or its
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, contractors, subcontractors, or
agents (the "Claims"). TENANT HEREBY WAIVES ITS IMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO
LANDLORD UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE ACT (RCW TITLE 51) AND/OR THE
LONGSHOREMEN'S AND HARBOR WORKER ACT, AND/OR ANY EQUIVALENT ACTS AND TENANT
EXPRESSLY AGREES TO ASSUME POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST
LANDLORD BY TENANT'S EMPLOYEES. THIS WAIVER HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY NEGOTIATED BY
THE PARTIES TO THIS LEASE AND TENANT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO, AND HAS BEEN
ENCOURAGED TO, CONSULT WITH INDEPENDENT COUNSEL REGARDING THIS WAIVER.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13, nothing in this
Section 13 shall relieve Landlord from responsibility for its proportionate
share of its fault attributable to its or its agents', contractors' or invitees'
negligence or willful misconduct in causing any such Claims.

Tenant shall not be liable for, and Landlord shall defend (unless Tenant waives
its rights to defense, and in any event with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Tenant), indemnify, hold harmless and protect Tenant and its employees and
agents from any claim, demand, liability, judgment, award, fine, mechanics lien
or other lien, loss, damage, expense, penalty, charge or cost of any kind of
character (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) which may be
made, incurred by or asserted against Tenant by third parties arising or
resulting from damage to property or injury to person to the extent caused by
the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents,
servants or representatives.

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       19

<PAGE>

contractual; products/completed operations; owners' and contractors' protective;
employer's contingent liability (stop gap); personal injury; insuring Tenant's
activities upon, in or about the Premises or the Building against claims of
bodily injury or death or property damage or loss with a combined single limit
of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence and Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate. General aggregate shall apply on a per
location basis. Landlord and others as required by Landlord shall be an
additional insured.

     14.3.     Property Insurance. Tenant shall, throughout the Term of this
Lease and any renewal hereof, at its own expense, keep and maintain in full
force and effect special form perils coverage on Tenant's leasehold
improvements, including without limitation, any improvements made by Landlord on
behalf Tenant or pursuant to a tenant allowance or credit at one hundred percent
(100%) of the current replacement cost value.

Landlord is not required to carry insurance of any kind on Tenant's improvements
or on Tenant's furniture, furnishings, fixtures, equipment or appurtenances of
Tenant under this Lease and Landlord shall not be obligated to repair any damage
thereto or replace the same.

     14.4.     Automobile Liability Insurance Requirements. Tenant shall
maintain automobile coverage with a combined single limit of not less than One
Million Dollars ($ 1,000,000). Coverage shall apply to any owned, non-owned or

     14.5.     Insurance Policy Requirements. All policies of insurance required
under this Section 14 shall be with companies reasonably approved by Landlord.
No insurance policy required under this Section 14 shall be cancelled or
materially reduced in coverage except after thirty (30) days (ten (10) days for
non-payment of premium) prior written notice to Landlord. All insurers shall
have a Best's rating of AV or better and be licensed and admitted to do business
in the State of Washington. The property and liability policies required under
this Section 14 shall be written as primary policies and not contributing to nor
in excess of any coverage Landlord may choose to maintain.

Tenant shall deliver to Landlord prior to the Commencement Date, copies of
policies of such insurance or certificates with endorsement, evidencing the
existence of the minimum required insurance and evidencing Landlord, Landlord's
mortgagee, and any other persons or entities requested by Landlord to be
included as additional insureds hereunder. In no event shall the limits of any
insurance policy required under this Section 14 be required under this Section
14 be considered as limiting the liability of Tenant under this Lease.

In no event shall the limits or coverages required to be carried be considered
as necessarily adequate nor limiting the liability of Tenant under this Lease.

     14.6.     Failure to Maintain Insurance. If Tenant fails or refuses to
maintain any insurance required, Landlord may, at its option, procure insurance
for Landlord's benefit and/or interests and any and all premiums paid by

and/or benefit.

     14.7.     Increased Insurance Costs. Tenant shall not keep, use, sell or

premiums for property and liability insurance that may be charged during the
Lease Term on the amount of such insurance which may be carried by Landlord on
the Premises or the Building or Buildings of which they are a part, resulting
from Tenant's particular activities on the Premises or from the type of
merchandise which Tenant stores or sells on the Premises, whether or not
Landlord has consented thereto. In the event of increased insurance costs to
Landlord, Tenant shall also pay an additional premium on the insurance policy or
policies that Landlord may carry for its protection against loss resulting from
any insured event. In determining whether increased premiums are the result of
Tenant's particular activities on the Premises, rates and/or premiums determined
by the organization and/or underwriter setting the insurance

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       20

<PAGE>

rates and/or charges on the Premises of Building or Buildings of which they are
a part shall be conclusive evidence of the several items and charges which make
up the insurance premium. Landlord shall deliver bills for such additional
premiums to Tenant at such times as Landlord may elect, and Tenant shall
immediately reimburse Landlord therefore.

15.  ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

     15.1.     Assignment or Sublease. Tenant shall not assign, mortgage,
encumber or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublet the whole or any part of the
Premises without in each case first obtaining Landlord's prior written consent,
which consent may not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. Tenant
also acknowledges that any right of first refusal, option to extend the Term of
this Lease, or any other options which Landlord has granted herein are
particular to Tenant and are not assignable or transferable to any assignee or
sublessee under this Lease, except to a Permitted Transferee.

In no event shall an assignment, subletting or other transfer of the Lease
relieve Tenant of any of its obligations under this Lease. Consent to any such
assignment, subletting or transfer shall not operate as a waiver of the
necessity for consent to any subsequent assignment, subletting or transfer.

If Tenant is a corporation, any transfer of this Lease by merger, consolidation
or liquidation, or any change in the ownership of a majority of its outstanding
voting stock, or power to vote a majority of its outstanding voting stock, shall
constitute an assignment for the purpose of this Section 15; provided, however,
for the purposes of this Section 15, a public offering of stock registered with
the SEC or a transfer of stock over a national exchange, shall not constitute a
transfer. If Tenant is a partnership, limited liability company, or other
entity, any transfer of this Lease by merger, consolidation, liquidation,
dissolution, or any change in the ownership of a majority of the ownership
and/or economic interests shall constitute an assignment for the purpose of this
Section 15.

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord's consent shall
not be required for any of the following transfers (each of which shall be an
"Affiliate Transfer"): (i) to any person(s) or entity who controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with Tenant, (ii) to any entity
resulting from the merger, consolidation or other reorganization with Tenant,
whether or not Tenant is the surviving entity, provided that the surviving
entity has a net worth equal to or greater than Tenant just prior to such
merger, consolidation or reorganization or (iii) to any person or legal entity
which acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Tenant
provided that the person or legal entity has a net worth equal to or greater
than Tenant just prior to such acquisition (each of the foregoing is hereinafter
referred to as a Tenant Affiliate); provided that before such assignment shall
be effective, (x) said Tenant Affiliate shall assume, in full, the obligations
of Tenant under this Lease, (y) Landlord shall be given written notice of such
assignment and assumption and (z) the use of the Premises by the Tenant
Affiliate shall be a Permitted Use.

     15.2.     Documentation and Expenses. In connection with each request for
an assignment or subletting Tenant shall: (i) submit in writing to Landlord the
name and legal composition of the proposed subtenant or assignee, the nature of
the proposed subtenant's or assignee's business to be carried on in the
Premises, the terms and provisions of the proposed sublease or assignment and
such reasonable financial information as Landlord may request concerning the
proposed subtenant or assignee; and (ii) pay Landlord's reasonable costs of
processing such assignment or subletting, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
upon demand of Landlord. Tenant shall provide Landlord with copies of all
assignments, subleases and assumption instruments.

     15.3.     Transferee Obligations. As a condition to Landlord's approval of
an assignment, any potential assignee otherwise acceptable to Landlord shall
assume, in writing, all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease and Tenant and
such assignee shall agree, in writing, to be jointly and severally liable for
the performance of all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease. As a condition
to Landlord's approval any sublessee otherwise

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       21

<PAGE>

acceptable to Landlord such sublessee shall assume, in writing, all of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease as to the subleased portion of the Premises and
Tenant and such sublessee shall agree, in writing, to be jointly and severally
liable with Tenant for the lesser of the Rent under this Lease or the Rent under
the sublease paid directly to Landlord and performance of all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of "Tenant" under the Lease with respect to the
subleased portion of the Premises. If an assignment or sublease is consented to
by Landlord, then the Tenant shall pay all costs incurred in connection
therewith (including any lease commissions and lease concessions), and the
assignment or sublease shall state that all Rent payments from the assignee or
sublessee shall be paid directly to Landlord. In connection with a permitted
assignment or sublease:

(a)  So long as the Tenant is not in default under this Lease, Landlord shall
grant to Tenant a credit against the monthly rental due under this Lease in the
amount of the rental actually received by Landlord under the assignment or
sublease for that month, calculated on a per square foot basis, and based upon
the portion of the Premises covered by the assignment or sublease. Landlord
shall pay to Tenant the amount of such credit in excess of the Rent under the
Lease as to such portion of the Premises except that Landlord shall be entitled
to fifty percent (50%) of such excess after subtracting Tenant's broker
commissions, attorneys' fees and improvement costs, as such commissions, fees
and costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. If in
any month Tenant is entitled to a credit under this subsection (a), but the
credit arises after the Tenant has paid in full the rental due under this Lease
for that month, then Landlord shall pay the amount of the credit within five (5)
business days after the date that the payment is received by Landlord from the
assignee or sublessee.

16.  SIGNS. Tenant shall not inscribe any inscription, or post, place, or in any
manner display any sign, graphics, notice, picture, placard or poster, or any
advertising matter whatsoever, anywhere in or about the Property at places
visible (either directly or indirectly as an outline or shadow on a glass pane)
from anywhere outside the Premises without first obtaining Landlord's written
consent, such consent to be at Landlord's reasonable discretion. Any such
consent by Landlord shall be upon the understanding and condition that Tenant
shall remove the same at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and
Tenant, at its expense, shall repair any damage to the Property, or any portion
thereof, caused by such removal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant is
permitted to place signage on the Building such signage must be pre-approved by
Landlord's architect (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
must comply with local laws. The cost of such signage, maintenance, repair and
operation shall be borne exclusively by Tenant. In addition to any signage of
Tenant existing prior to the Commencement Date, Tenant shall have the right to
install, at its sole cost and expense, Building exterior signage for increased
presence, subject to Landlord's reasonable approval of the design and
specifications thereof and compliance with city codes and standards.

17.  LIENS. Tenant has no authority to allow any liens to be placed against the
Property. Tenant shall keep its interest in this Lease, any property of Tenant
located on the Property, and the Property free from any liens arising out of any
work performed or materials ordered or obligations incurred by or on behalf of
Tenant and Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless
from and against any liability from any such lien, including without limitation,
liens arising from Tenant's Work. In the event any lien is filed against the
Property, or any portion thereof, by any person claiming by, through or under
Tenant, Tenant shall, upon request of Landlord and at Tenant's expense,
immediately either cause such lien to be released of record or furnish to
Landlord a bond, in form and amount and issued by a surety, reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord, indemnifying Landlord and the Property against all
liability, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, which Landlord may
incur as a result thereof. Provided that such bond has been furnished to
Landlord, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense and after written notice to
Landlord, may contest, by appropriate proceedings conducted in good faith and
with due diligence, any lien, encumbrance or charge against the Property arising
from work done or materials provided to and for Tenant, if, and only if, such
proceedings suspend the collection thereof

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       22

<PAGE>

against Landlord, Tenant and the Property and neither the Property nor any part
thereof or interest therein is or will be, in Landlord's sole judgment, in any
danger of being sold, forfeited or lost.

18.  BANKRUPTCY.

     18.1.     Assumption of Lease. In the event Tenant becomes a Debtor under
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code ("Code") or a petition for reorganization or
adjustment of debts is filed concerning Tenant under Chapters 11 or 13 of the
Code, or a proceeding is filed under Chapter 7 of the Code and is transferred to
Chapters 11 or 13 of the Code, the Trustee or Tenant, as Debtor and as
Debtor-In-Possession, may not elect to assume this Lease unless, at the time of
such assumption, the Trustee or Tenant has cured all defaults under the Lease
and paid all sums due and owing under the Lease or provided Landlord with
"Adequate Assurance" (as defined below) that: (i) within ten (10) days from the
date of such assumption, the Trustee or Tenant will completely pay all sums due
and owing under this Lease and compensate Landlord for any actual pecuniary loss
resulting from any existing default or breach of this Lease, including without
limitation, Landlord's reasonable costs, expenses, accrued interest, and
attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the default or breach; (ii) within
twenty (20) days from the date of such assumption, the Trustee or Tenant will
cure all non-monetary defaults and breaches under this Lease, or, if the nature
of such non-monetary defaults is such that more than twenty (20) days are
reasonably required for such cure, that the Trustee or Tenant will commence to
cure such non-monetary defaults within twenty (20) days and thereafter
diligently prosecute such cure to completion; and (iii) the assumption will be
subject to all of the provisions of this Lease.

               18.1.1.   Definition of Adequate Assurances. For purposes of this
Section 18, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that in the context of a bankruptcy
proceeding involving Tenant, at a minimum, "Adequate Assurance" shall mean: (i)
the Trustee or Tenant has and will continue to have sufficient unencumbered
assets after the payment of all secured obligations and administrative expenses
to assure Landlord that the Trustee or Tenant will have sufficient funds to
fulfill the obligations of Tenant under this Lease; and (ii) the Bankruptcy
Court shall have entered an Order segregating sufficient cash payable to
Landlord and/or the Trustee or Tenant shall have granted a valid and perfected
first lien and security interest and/or mortgage in or on property of Trustee or
Tenant acceptable as to value and kind to Landlord, to secure to Landlord the
obligation of the Trustee or Tenant to cure the monetary and/or non-monetary
defaults and breaches under this Lease within the time periods set forth above;
and (iii) the Trustee or Tenant, at the very minimum, shall deposit a sum equal
to two (2) month's Base Rent to be held by Landlord (without any allowance for
interest thereon) to secure Tenant's future performance under the Lease.

     18.2.     Assignment of Lease. If the Trustee or Tenant has assumed the
Lease pursuant to the provisions of this Section 18 for the purpose of assigning
Tenant's interest hereunder to any other person or entity, such interest may be
assigned only after the Trustee, Tenant or the proposed assignee have complied
with all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, including,
without limitation, those with respect to Additional Rent. Landlord and Tenant
acknowledge that such terms, covenants and conditions are commercially
reasonable in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding of Tenant. Any person or
entity to which this Lease is assigned pursuant to the provisions of the Code
shall be deemed without further act or deed to have assumed all of the
obligations arising under this Lease on and after the date of such assignment.
Any such assignee shall upon request execute and deliver to Landlord an
instrument confirming such assignment.

     18.3.     Adequate Protection. Upon the filing of a petition by or against
Tenant under the Code, Tenant, as Debtor and as Debtor-In-Possession, and any
Trustee who may be appointed agree to adequately protect Landlord as follows:
(i) to perform each and every obligation of Tenant under this Lease until such
time as this Lease is either rejected or assumed by Order of the Bankruptcy
Court; (ii) to pay all monetary obligations required under this Lease, including
without limitation, payment of Rent and Additional Rent

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       23

<PAGE>

payable hereunder which is considered reasonable compensation for the use and
occupancy of the Premises; (iii) provide Landlord a minimum of thirty (30) days
prior written notice, unless a shorter period is agreed to in writing by the
parties, of any proceeding relating to any assumption of this Lease or any
intent to abandon the Premises, which abandonment shall be deemed a rejection of
this Lease; and (iv) to perform to the benefit of Landlord as otherwise required
under the Code. The failure of Tenant to comply with the above shall result in
an automatic rejection of this Lease.

19.  DEFAULT.

     19.1.     Cumulative Remedies. All rights of Landlord in this Lease shall
be cumulative, and none shall exclude any other right or remedy allowed by law
in force when the default occurs or in equity. In addition to the other remedies
provided in this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to restrain by injunction
(without bond) the violation or attempted violation of any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions of Tenant under this Lease.

     19.2.     Tenant's Default; Right to Cure. The failure of Tenant to perform
any obligation of Tenant as provided in this Lease shall be a default under this
Lease. Tenant shall have a period of five (5) business days from the date of
Tenant's receipt of written notice from Landlord to Tenant within which to cure
any default in the payment of Rent. Tenant shall have a period of twenty (20)
business days from the date of written notice from Landlord to Tenant to cure
any other default under this Lease; provided, however, that with respect to any
such default which cannot be cured within such twenty (20) day period, the
default shall not be deemed to be uncured if Tenant commences to cure within
twenty (20) days and for so long as Tenant is diligently prosecuting the cure
thereof, but in no event longer than ninety (90) days. If the nature of the
default is one that can be cured immediately (e.g. turn off loud music, take
unauthorized sign off door, etc.), Tenant will use its best efforts to cure
immediately. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 19.2,
Landlord shall not be required to provide notice to Tenant of a particular
nonpayment of Rent for a particular month more than once.

     19.3.     Landlord's Rights And Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an uncured
default by Tenant, Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies it may
have, at its option, may exercise any one or more of the following rights
without further notice or demand of any kind to Tenant or any other person,
except as required by applicable State law:

               19.3.1.   Termination of Lease. The right of Landlord to
terminate this Lease and Tenant's right to possess the Premises and to reenter
the Premises, take possession thereof and remove all persons from the Premises,
following which Tenant shall have no further claim thereon or hereunder;
provided, however, that Tenant shall remain obligated as provided in Section
19.4 below.

               19.3.2.   Re-entry of the Premises. The right of Landlord,
without terminating this Lease and Tenant's right to possess the Premises, to
reenter the Premises and occupy the whole or any part of the Premises for and on
account of Tenant and to collect any unpaid Rents which have become payable, or
which may thereafter become payable; provided, however, that Tenant shall remain
obligated as provided in Section 19.4 below.

               19.3.3.   Termination After Reentry. The right of Landlord, even
though it may have reentered the Premises in accordance with Section 19.3.2, to
elect thereafter to terminate this Lease and Tenant's right to possess the
Premises; provided, however, that Tenant shall remain obligated as provided in
Section 19.4 below.

Should Landlord reenter the Premises under Section 19.3.2, Landlord shall not be
deemed to have terminated this Lease or to have accepted a surrender thereof by
any such reentry, unless Landlord shall have notified Tenant in writing that it
has so elected to terminate this Lease and Tenant's right of possession. Tenant
further covenants that Landlord's service of

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       24

<PAGE>

any notice pursuant to the unlawful detainer statutes of the State of Washington
and Tenant's surrender of possession pursuant to such notice shall not (unless
Landlord elects in writing to the contrary at the time of, or at any time
subsequent to, the serving of such written notice and such election is evidenced
by a notice to Tenant) be deemed to be a termination of this Lease.

     19.4.     Landlord's Damages. If Landlord terminates this Lease and/or
Tenant's right to possession of the Premises pursuant to the terms of this
Section 19, Landlord may recover from Tenant as damages, all of the following:

               19.4.1.   Delinquent Rent The worth at the time of award of any
unpaid Rent earned at the time of such termination;

               19.4.2.   Rent After Termination Until Judgment The worth at the
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent that would have been earned
after termination until the time of award exceeds such rent loss Tenant proves
could have been reasonably avoided;

               19.4.3.   Rent After Judgment The worth at the time of award of
the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the
time of award exceeds the amount of such rent loss that Tenant proves could be
reasonably avoided;

               19.4.4.   Other Compensation. Any other amount necessary to
compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure
to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result there from, including, without limitation, any
cost or expense incurred by Landlord in (i) retaking possession of the Premises,
including reasonable attorney fees therefore, (ii) maintaining or preserving the
Premises after such default, (iii) preparing the Premises for reletting to a new
tenant, including repairs necessary to the Premises for such reletting, (iv)
leasing commissions, limited to those years remaining in the initial term, and
(v) any other costs necessary or appropriate to relet the Premises; and

               19.4.5.   Additional or Alternative Damages. At Landlord's
election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing in this
Section 19.4 as may be permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of
Washington; and

               19.4.6.   Calculation of Damages. As used in Sections 19.4.1 and
19.4.2, the "worth at the time of award" is to be computed by allowing interest
at the rate specified in Section 4.2. As used in Section 19.4.3, the "worth at
the time of award" is computed by discounting such amount at a discount rate
equal to six percent (6%) per annum. All Rent, other than Base Rent, shall, for
the purposes of calculating any amount due under the provisions of Section
19.4.3 be computed on the basis of the average monthly amount thereof accruing
during the immediately preceding sixty (60) month period, except that if it
becomes necessary to compute such rent before such a sixty (60) month period has
occurred, then such rent shall be computed on the basis of the average monthly
amount hereof accruing during such shorter period.

     19.5.     Tenant's Property. Without limiting any of Landlord's rights
under this Lease, in the event of a termination this Lease pursuant to Section
19, all of Tenant's property, trade fixtures, equipment not permanently attached
to the Premises, attached equipment specified on Exhibit C-l and other personal
property shall be removed by Tenant immediately upon demand by Landlord. If not
so removed by Tenant, Landlord may remove such property from the Premises and
place it in storage at a public warehouse at the expense and risk of Tenant,
after which it shall be subject to the sale provisions of Section 21. Trade
fixtures, furniture, unattached equipment and attached equipment specified on
Exhibit C-l and other personal property installed in the Premises by Tenant
shall at all times be and remain Tenant's property ('Tenant's Property"). Upon
request by Tenant's lenders and equipment lessors from time to time, Landlord
agrees to waive, in favor of current and future lenders and equipment lessors of
Tenant, any lien rights Landlord may

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       25

<PAGE>

have with respect to Tenant's Property pursuant to a lien release, the form of
which shall be reasonably acceptable to Landlord.

     19.6.     No Waiver. The waiver by either party of any breach of any term,
covenant or condition contained in this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of such term, covenant or condition or any subsequent breach thereof, or of any
other term, covenant or condition contained in this Lease. Landlord's subsequent
acceptance of partial rent or performance by Tenant shall not be deemed to be an
accord and satisfaction or a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any
term, covenant or condition of this Lease or of any right of Landlord to a
forfeiture of the Lease by reason of such breach, regardless of Landlord's
knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of Landlord's acceptance. No
term, covenant or condition of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived by
either party unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving party.

     19.7.     Waiver of Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 19, Tenant waives (to the fullest extent permitted under law) any
written notice, other than such notice as this Section 19 or any other provision
of this Lease specifically requires, which any statute or law now or hereafter
in force prescribes be given Tenant. Landlord agrees to provide Tenant with
written notice of any event or condition that could materially affect Tenant's
use of the Premises or enjoyment of the Lease.

     19.8.     Waiver of Redemption Rights. Tenant, for itself, and on behalf of
any and all persons claiming through or under it, including creditors of all
kinds, does hereby waive and surrender all right and privilege which they or any
of them might have under or by reason of any present or future law, to redeem
the Premises or to have a continuance of this Lease for the term hereof, as it
may have been extended, after having been dispossessed or ejected there from by
process of law or under the terms of this Lease or after the termination of this
Lease as herein provided.

     19.9.     Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate. Landlord shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages resulting from a default
by Tenant.

     19.10.    Default by Landlord. Landlord's failure to perform or observe any
of its obligations under this Lease or to correct a breach of any warranty or
representation made in this Lease within thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice from Tenant setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and
extent of the failure referencing pertinent Lease provisions or if more than
thirty (30) days is required to cure the breach, Landlord's failure to begin
curing within the thirty (30) day period and diligently prosecute the cure to
completion within no more than ninety (90) days, shall constitute a default. If
Landlord commits a default that materially affects Tenant's use of the Premises,
and Tenant has provided simultaneous written notice thereof to Landlord's
mortgagee (if any and if Tenant has notice thereof) and Landlord (and/or
Landlord's mortgagee if any) has failed to commence to cure such default within
thirty (30) days (or such shorter time as is commercially reasonable in the case
of an emergency threatening imminent harm to persons or property), Tenant may,
without waiving any claim for damages for breach of agreement, thereafter cure
the default for the account of the Landlord, which cure shall be preceded by an
additional written notice given at least three (3) days prior to such cure to
Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee that Tenant plans to undertake the cure, and
the reasonable cost of such cure shall be deemed paid or incurred for the
account of Landlord, and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for Tenant's
out-of-pocket expenditures paid to third parties to effectuate such cure, such
reimbursement to be within thirty (30) days after completion of the cure and
invoice to Landlord showing the costs of cure. Tenant's cure rights shall be hi
lieu of any right to terminate this Lease. If Landlord disputes either the
necessity of the cure or the cost thereof, the matter shall be settled by
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance
with its Rules for the Real Estate Industry before a single neutral arbitrator
of the American Arbitration Association sitting in Seattle, Washington. The
arbitrator shall be a person having at least ten (10) years' experience and
knowledge about commercial leasing and property management. The arbitration
shall be held within sixty (60) days of Landlord notifying Tenant it disputes
Tenant's cure. The costs of the arbitrator

                                       26

<PAGE>

shall be shared equally by the parties. The prevailing party shall be entitled
to an award of reasonable attorneys fees. The arbitrator's award shall be final
and binding on the parties.

     20.       Subordination and Attornment. This Lease shall be subordinate to
any mortgage or deed of trust now existing or hereafter placed upon the Land,
the Building or the Premises, created by or at the instance of Landlord, and to
any and all advances to be made hereunder and to interest thereon and all
modifications, renewals and replacements or extensions thereof ("Landlord's
Mortgage"); provided, however, that the holder of any Landlord's Mortgage or any
person or persons purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Land, Building or
Premises at any sale or other proceeding under any Landlord's Mortgage may elect
to continue this Lease in full force and effect and, in such event, Tenant shall
attorn to such person or persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a lender
requires that the Lease be subordinate to any mortgage recorded after the date
of the Lease affecting the Property, the Lease shall be subordinate to such
mortgage if Landlord first obtains from such lender a written statement
providing that so long as Tenant performs its obligations under the Lease, no
foreclosure of, deed given in lieu of foreclosure of, or sale under the
mortgage, and no steps or procedures, taken under the mortgage, shall affect
Tenant's rights under this Lease (a "Nondisturbance Agreement"); provided,
however, then the holder of Landlord's Mortgage, or any person or persons
purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Land, Building or Premises at any sale or
other proceeding under any Landlord's Mortgage, shall not be subject to any
option to purchase, or right of first refusal to purchase, granted to Tenant in
connection with this Lease. Prior to the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
obtain a Nondisturbance Agreement executed by all existing holders of any
mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease affecting the Land, the Building or the
Premises.

Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver documents, which the Holder of any
Landlord's Mortgage may require to effectuate the provisions of this Section 20
within ten (10) business days of the date of Landlord's request therefore. In
the event of any transfer of Landlord's interest in the Premises or in the
Property, other than a transfer for security purposes only, the transferor shall
be automatically relieved of any and all obligations and liabilities on the part
of Landlord accruing from and after the date of such transfer and such
transferee shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any matter
occurring or arising prior to the date of such transfer. Tenant agrees to attorn
to such transferee, provided transferee assumes all of Landlord's
responsibilities.

     21.       Removal of Property. Upon the expiration of this Lease, Tenant
shall remove all of Tenant's personal property, furniture and equipment not
permanently affixed to the Premises or as specified on Exhibit C-l, and shall
pay Landlord any damages for injury to the Premises or Property resulting from
such removal. If Tenant fails to remove any such property from the Premises at
the expiration of this Lease, Landlord may remove and store said property
without liability for loss thereof or damage thereto. Such storage shall be for
the account and at the expense of Tenant. If Tenant fails to pay the cost of
storing any such property after it has been stored for a period of thirty (30)
days or more, or if Tenant has not removed the property from the Premises after
a thirty (30) day period, Landlord may, at its option, sell, or permit to be
sold, any or all such property at public or private sale, in such manner and at
such times and places as Landlord in its sole discretion may deem proper (so
long as the same is in compliance with laws), without notice to Tenant, unless
notice is required under applicable statutes, and shall apply the proceeds of
such sale first, to the cost and expense of such sale, including reasonable
attorneys' fees actually incurred; second, to the payment of the costs or
charges for storing any such property; third, to the cost of removal of such
property and the restoration of the Premises following such removal; fourth, to
the payment of any other sums of money which may then be or thereafter become
due Landlord from Tenant under any of the terms of this Lease; and, fifth, the
balance, if any, shall be paid to Tenant.

     22.       Condemnation.

               22.1.     Entire Taking. If all of the Premises, or such portion
of the Building as may be required for the reasonable use of the Premises, in
Landlord's reasonable

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       27

<PAGE>

determination, are taken by eminent domain, this Lease shall automatically
terminate as of the date title vests in the condemning authority and all Rent,
Additional Rent and other payments shall be paid to that date.

     22.2.     Constructive Taking of Entire Premises. In the event of a taking
by eminent domain of a material part of but less than all of the Building, if
Landlord determines that the remaining portions of the Building cannot be
economically and effectively used by it (whether on account of physical,
economic, aesthetic or other reasons) or if Landlord determines the Building
should be restored in such a way as to materially alter the Premises, then
Landlord shall forward a written notice to Tenant of such determination not more
than sixty (60) days after the date of taking. The Term of this Lease shall
expire upon the date specified by Landlord in such notice but not earlier than
sixty (60) days after the date of such notice.

     22.3.     Partial Taking. Subject to the provisions of the preceding
Section 22.2, in case of taking by eminent domain of a part of the Premises, or
a portion of the Building not required for the reasonable use of the Premises,
then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect and the Rent shall be
equitably reduced based on the proportion by which the floor area of the
Premises is reduced, such Rent reduction to be effective as of the date title to
such portion vests in the condemning authority. If more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the Premises is taken and Landlord cannot replace such space with space
in the Building, which is mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant, then with
sixty (60) days written notice by either party, Landlord or Tenant shall have
the right to terminate this Lease.

     22.4.     Awards and Damages. Landlord reserves all rights to damages to
the Premises for any partial, constructive, or entire taking by eminent domain,
and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord any right Tenant may have to such damages
or award, and Tenant shall make no claim against Landlord or the condemning
authority for damages for termination of the leasehold interest or interference
with Tenant's business. Tenant shall have the right, however, to claim and
recover from the condemning authority compensation for any loss to which Tenant
may be put for Tenant's moving expenses, business interruption or taking of
Tenant's personal property, furniture and equipment identified on Exhibit C-l
(not including Tenant's leasehold interest) and the unamortized cost of
improvements made to the Premises at Tenant's cost, provided that such damages
may be claimed only if they are awarded separately in the eminent domain
proceedings and not out of or as part of and/or will not reduce any damages
recoverable by Landlord.

     23.       Notices. All notices under this Lease shall be in writing and
delivered in person or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or
by private overnight courier to Landlord and to Tenant at their respective
Notice Addresses set forth in Section 1.16 (provided that after the Commencement
Date any such notice shall be mailed, delivered by hand to Tenant at the
Premises) or such other addresses as may from time to time be designated by any
such party in writing. Notices mailed as provided in this Section shall be
deemed given and received on the date that is three (3) business days following
the date of post mark, in the case of mailing, or one (1) day after deposit with
a private overnight courier.

     24.       Costs and Attorneys' Fees. If Tenant or Landlord brings any
action for any relief against the other, declaratory or otherwise, arising out
of this Lease, each party shall, and hereby does to the extent permitted by law,
waive trial by jury and the losing party shall pay the substantially prevailing
party's attorneys' fees in connection with such suit, at trial and on appeal,
and such attorneys' fees shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of
such action. If Landlord consults with an attorney as a result of a default by
Tenant hereunder, Tenant agrees to pay any such attorneys' fees incurred by
Landlord, and such attorneys' fees shall constitute additional sums due by
Tenant hereunder. In addition, in the event of a default by Tenant under this
Lease, and any action is instituted by Landlord as a result of Tenant's default,
then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in addition to other costs, expenses, and
attorneys' fees incurred by Landlord, and hourly fee of Fifty

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       28

<PAGE>

Dollars ($50.00) per hour for time spent by each employee or agent of Landlord
in connection with such default and at a minimum, One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).

     25.       Landlord's Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to
the contrary, covenants, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of
Landlord in this Lease are made and intended not as personal covenants,
undertakings and agreements for the purpose of binding Landlord personally or
the assets of Landlord (except Landlord's interest in the Premises and
Building), but are made and intended for the purpose of binding only the
Landlord's interest in the Premises and Building, as the same may from time to
time be encumbered and the proceeds of the sale thereof and rental proceeds
thereof. No personal liability or personal responsibility is assumed by
Landlord, nor shall at any time be asserted or enforceable against Landlord or
its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns on account of the Lease
or on account of any covenant, undertaking or agreement of Landlord in this
Lease.

     26.       Landlord's Consent. Except as may be provided otherwise in this
Lease, whenever Landlord's consent or approval is required under this Lease,
such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, provided, however, Landlord's withholding of consent due to any
mortgagee's refusal to grant its consent where its consent would be required
shall not be deemed unreasonable.

     27.       Estoppel Certificates. Tenant shall, from time to time upon the
written request of Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord or its
designee a written statement stating: the Effective Date, Commencement Date and
Expiration Date, the date the term commenced and the date Tenant accepted the
Premises; the amount of Base Rent and the date to which such Base Rent and
Additional Rent has been paid; and certifying such additional information as may
be reasonably requested by Landlord. It is intended that any such statement
delivered pursuant to this Section may be relied upon by Landlord and/or a
prospective purchaser or mortgagee who may acquire an interest in, or a lien
upon, Landlord's interest in the Building. If Tenant shall fail to respond
within ten (10) business days of receipt by Tenant of a written request by
Landlord as herein provided, Tenant shall be deemed to have given such
certificate as above provided without modification and shall be deemed to have
admitted the accuracy of any information supplied by Landlord to a prospective
purchaser or mortgagee and to have certified that this Lease is in full force
and effect, that this Lease represents the entire agreement between the parties
as to this leasing, that there are no existing claims, defenses or offsets which
Tenant has against enforcement of the Lease by Landlord, that there are no
uncured defaults in Landlord's performance, that the security deposit is as
stated in the Lease, and that not more than one month's Base Rent or Additional
Rent has been paid in advance.

     28.       Right to Perform. If Tenant fails to pay any sum of money
required to be paid by it under this Lease or fails to perform any other act on
its part to be performed under this Lease, and such failure continues for ten
(10) days after notice thereof by Landlord, Landlord may, but shall not be
obligated so to do, and without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations
of Tenant, make such payment or perform any such other act on Tenant's part to
be made or performed as provided in this Lease. Landlord shall have (in addition
to any other right or remedy of Landlord) the same rights and remedies in the
event of the nonpayment of sums due under this Section 28 as in the case of
default by Tenant in the payment of Rent.

     29.       Parking. In the event that Landlord elects to regulate parking on
the Property pursuant to a parking pass system, then Tenant shall be entitled to
purchase eighty-four (84) parking passes for the Building's parking garage;
however, Landlord reserves the right to provide some of Tenant's parking stalls
in the adjacent building located at 101 Elliott Avenue West. Each parking pass
may be used by one person only, and may not be shared; no sharing or hoteling of
stalls shall be permitted. Use of the parking stalls shall be subject to such
prevailing market rate charges, and such rules and regulations, as Landlord
and/or Landlord's parking operator may adopt from time to time. Landlord retains
the right to adjust the charge for parking to prevailing market rate charges and
reasonably amend such

Office Lease Agreement-NNN

                                       29

<PAGE>

rules and regulations and to reasonably relocate or reconfigure the parking
area, with reasonable notice to Tenant. However, the cost for such parking shall
be $160.00 per month per stall through December 2003. Landlord shall at all
times continue to provide the designated number of passes to Tenant and Tenant
shall at all times be entitled to use eighty-four (84) parking spaces in the
Building's parking garage. Tenant shall pay, upon demand by Landlord, Landlord's
costs incurred to stencil any changes to reserved parking stalls provided to
Tenant under this Lease.

     30.       Authority. If Tenant is a corporation, Tenant represents and
warrants that each individual executing this Lease on behalf of Tenant is duly
authorized to execute and deliver this Lease on behalf of Tenant, in accordance
with a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors of Tenant and in
accordance with the bylaws of Tenant, and that this Lease is binding upon Tenant
in accordance with its terms.

     31.       General.

               31.1.     Headings. Titles to Sections of this Lease are not a

terms and conditions contained in this Lease shall inure to and be binding upon
the Landlord and Tenant and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns.

               31.3.     No Brokers. Except as provided in Section 1, Landlord
and Tenant represent and warrant to one another that they have not engaged any
broker, finder or other person who would be entitled to any commission or fees
in respect of the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Lease and Landlord
and Tenant shall indemnify and hold one another harmless from and against any
loss, cost, liability or expense incurred by the other party as a result of any
claim asserted by any such broker, finder or other person on the basis of any
arrangements or agreements made or alleged to have been made by or on behalf of
the indemnifying party. In no event will a brokerage fee be paid on any renewal
or Option to renew. Tenant agrees that any broker it may elect to assist in any
renewal discussions or options will be compensated directly by Tenant.

               31.4.     Tenant's Financial Statement. Within ten (10) business
days of receipt by Tenant of Landlord's written request from time to time but in
no event more than once per calendar year, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a
copy of its most recent annual and quarterly audited financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including
a balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in stockholder's or
owner's equity, statement of cash flow, accompanying footnotes, and reports of
independent accountants. Landlord shall hold Tenant's financial information in
confidence and agrees to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement if so
requested by Tenant. Such financial information may be provided to a prospective
purchaser or mortgagee, subject to the same confidentiality requirements.

               31.5.     Entire Agreement. This Lease contains all covenants and
agreements between Landlord and Tenant relating in any manner to the leasing,
use and occupancy of the Premises, to Tenant's use of the Building and other
matters set forth in this Lease, to the extent all of the foregoing relate to
the time period following the Commencement Date. No prior agreements or
understanding pertaining to the same shall be valid or of any force or effect
and the covenants and agreements of this Lease shall not be altered, modified or
added to except in writing signed by Landlord and Tenant.

               31.6.     Severability. Any provision of this Lease which shall
prove to be invalid, void or illegal shall in no way affect, impair or
invalidate any other provision hereof and the remaining provisions hereof shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

               31.7.     Force Majeure. (A) Landlord. Landlord shall have no
liability whatsoever to Tenant on account of Landlord's inability to timely

reason of any requirement, act or omission of the public utility or others
furnishing the Building with electricity or water; and (e) for any other reason,
whether similar or dissimilar to the above, or for Act of God, beyond Landlord's
reasonable control. If this Lease specifies a time period for performance of an
obligation of Landlord to complete Landlord's Work, or the restoration of the
Building and the Premises following damage or destruction, that time period
shall be extended by the period of any delay in Landlord's performance caused by
any of the events of force majeure described herein.

(B)  Tenant. Tenant shall have no liability whatsoever to Landlord on account of

Tenant's Work following damage or destruction, as a result of "force majeure,"

furnished to the Premises by reason of any requirement, act or omission of the
public utility or others furnishing the Building with electricity or water; and
(e) for any other reason, whether similar or dissimilar to the above, or for Act
of God, beyond Tenant's reasonable control. If this Lease specifies a time
period for performance of an obligation of Tenant to complete Tenant's Work, or
the restoration of Tenant's Work following damage or destruction, that time
period shall be extended by the period of any delay in Tenant's performance
caused by any of the events of force majeure described herein. Nothing in this
section shall be construed as excusing or delaying the obligation of Tenant to
pay in a timely manner when due any Rent or other amounts due under this Lease.

               31.8.     Right to Change Public Spaces. Landlord shall have the
right at any time without thereby creating an actual or constructive eviction or
incurring any liability to Tenant therefore, to change the arrangement or
location of such of the following as are not contained within the Premises or
any part thereof: entrances, passageways, doors and doorways, corridors, stairs,
toilets and other public portions of the Property. In no event, however, shall
Landlord diminish any service provided by Landlord under this Lease, make any
change which reduces the area of the Premises, make any change which, on other
than a temporary basis, either changes the character of the Building from that
of an office building or materially interferes with Tenant's access to and use
of the Building.

               31.9.     Governing Law. This Lease shall be governed by and

architects' reasonable approval.

Lease to be performed by Tenant, may quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises

(Condemnation.

indemnification obligations of the parties to this Lease shall survive the

provision of this Lease.

     Exhibit C as Schedule 1. Schedule 1 also includes three exhibits, which
     illustrate the location of the "Expansion Spaces" which house the "Trade

     to reinforce or level the flooring of the Premises or the existing
     electrical system, to accommodate Tenant.

II.  CONSTRUCTION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS

     A.   Improvements Constructed by Tenant If any work is to be performed in
     connection with Tenant Improvements on the Premises by Tenant or Tenant's
     contractor of a type requiring the participation of a general contractor:

               (1)  Such work shall proceed upon Landlord's written approval of
     (i) Tenant's contractor, (ii) public liability and property damage
     insurance satisfactory to Landlord carried by Tenant's contractor, and
     (iii) detailed plans and specifications for such work where detailed plans
     and specifications are appropriate. Landlord's approval of the foregoing
     shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (iv) Landlord shall have
     the right to require Tenant's contractor to deposit a reasonable amount to
     secure the close out and clean up of Tenant's Work.

               (2)  All work shall be done in conformity with a valid building
     permit when required, a copy of which shall be furnished to Landlord before
     such work is commenced, and in any case, all such work shall be performed
     in accordance with all applicable governmental regulations. Notwithstanding
     any failure by Landlord to object to any such work, Landlord shall have no
     responsibility for Tenant's failure to meet all applicable regulations
     (except, where Sabey Construction is the contractor, to the extent of Sabey
     Construction's negligence or willful misconduct).

               (3)  All work by Tenant or Tenant's contractor shall be scheduled
     through Landlord.

               (4)  (i) Tenant or Tenant's contractor shall arrange for
     necessary utility, hoisting and elevator service with Landlord's
     contractor; (ii) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for any sums

     structural reviews) subject to the limits set forth in Section 9 of the
     Lease; and (ii) Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for its actual costs
     to supervise the Alterations not to exceed five percent (5%) of the hard
     costs incurred by Tenant's contractor except that Tenant shall not

<PAGE>

     be responsible for any such supervision costs if Sabey Construction is the
     contractor being used.

               (5)  Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for costs incurred
     by Landlord due to faulty work done by Tenant or its contractors, or by
     reason of any delays caused by such work, or by reason of inadequate
     clean-up.

               (6)  Landlord shall have the right to post a notice or notices in
     conspicuous places in or about the Premises announcing its
     non-responsibility for the work being performed therein.

               (7)  Landlord shall retain the right to all equipment and
     materials to be salvaged or demolished from the Premises (other than
     Tenant's property identified in Exhibit C-l or equipment and materials that
     Tenant elects to reuse in the Premises).

     If Sabey Construction Inc. constructs the Tenant Improvements on behalf of
     Tenant, Landlord acknowledges satisfaction of Paragraphs (l)(i), (l)(ii),
     3,4(i), 4(iii), 5, and 6 of this Section II.A.

     B.   Tenant's Telephone. Tenant is responsible for Tenant's telephone
     service. Tenant shall select Tenant's telephone system.

III. RETENTION OF SABEY CONSTRUCTION INC. AS TENANT'S CONTRACTOR.

     Tenant shall retain Sabey Construction Inc. as Tenant's general contractor
     for any Tenant Improvements Tenant elects to construct for which Tenant
     chooses to employ the services of a general contractor on terms and
     conditions mutually acceptable to Tenant and Sabey Construction. The form
     of contract to be used in any such engagement shall be substantially in the
     same form as Exhibit C-2 attached hereto. The price for such the
     construction of such improvements would be the actual cost plus Sabey
     Construction Inc.'s fee as general contractor of four percent (4%) on the
     actual cost, including general conditions. Applicable state and local taxes
     will also be included.

                              AND MECHANICAL SYSTEM

4.   Additional Expansion Space. Section 47 of the Lease Agreement shall be
     amended in its entirety to read:

47.  ADDITIONAL EXPANSION SPACE.

     a.   Tenant Occupancy. Landlord shall deliver the Additional Expansion
          Space to Tenant on September 1, 1996; provided, however, Tenant may
          enter the Expansion Space prior to the delivery date for the purposes
          of architectural, design or engineering review. Landlord's delivery of
          the Additional Expansion Space shall be in it's "AS IS" condition as
          of the date of delivery and Landlord shall not be required to make
          alterations, additions, or improvements to the Additional Expansion
          Space; except that Landlord shall seal the stairwell presently located
          within the Additional Expansion Space, eliminating access between the
          second floor and the Additional Expansion Space.

     b.   Base Service Year. For the purposes of determining Additional Rent for
          the Additional Expansion Space, the Additional Expansion Space shall
          have a Base Service Year of 1992.

     c.   Trade Improvements. Landlord hereby agrees to lease to Tenant and

               Expiration Date, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the
               Lease. It is the intent of the parties that the term of the lease
               for the Trade Improvements be co-terminous with the lease of the
               Premises.

          ii.  Condition and Uses. Landlord shall deliver the Trade Improvements
               in their "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition, without representation or
               warranty of any kind whatsoever, whether express or implied,
               including without limitation, warranty for habitability,
               suitability or for particular use and Landlord shall not be
               required to make any allegations, repairs or improvements to the
               Trade Improvements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord
               represents to Tenant that to the best of their knowledge, the
               Trade Improvements have been adequately maintained and repaired
               by the prior tenant and owner, Oncomembrane, Inc. and is in
               reasonably good working order, normal wear and tear excepted.
               Tenant hereby agrees that with respect to its use of the Personal
               Property, it will comply with all of the terms of the Lease,
               including without limitation, Section 6 of the Lease.

          iii. Repair, Maintenance and Alterations. Tenant hereby agrees to

               Improvements at all times during the term hereof. Tenant shall
               maintain the Trade Improvements at all times in good repair.
               Tenant shall make no alterations or modifications to the Trade
               Improvements without the prior written consent of the Landlord.
               In addition to the foregoing, Tenant agrees that all other terms
               and conditions of the Lease shall apply to the Trade Improvements
               and its repair or maintenance, unless directly contrary to the
               foregoing terms in this paragraph.

<PAGE>

               all Real Property Taxes (as defined in the Lease) on the Trade
               Improvements and provide Landlord with evidence of such payment.
               Tenant shall maintain Liability and property damage insurance on
               the Trade Improvements at all times during the term hereof in
               accordance with the requirements of Section 16 of the Lease.

          v.   Removal of Property and Surrender. Tenant shall not remove the
               Trade Improvements from the Premises without the prior written
               consent of the Landlord. Upon the termination of the Lease,
               Tenant shall surrender the Trade Improvements to the Landlord in
               good working condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.

     d.   Mechanical System. The Additional Expansion Space is serviced by
          mechanical and physical systems (collectively, "Mechanical System"),
          specifically air handling unit(s), boilers, chillers, natural gas,
          electricity and vacuum that also will continue to provide service to
          the first and second floors of the Building. Notwithstanding the terms
          of this paragraph, Tenant shall continue to be responsible for
          maintaining mechanical equipment (e.g., air handling unit and exhaust
          fans) located in the small mechanical room on the roof of the second
          floor of the Building which services the Organic Chemistry Lab of the
          Additional Expansion Space (labeled "OCL" on Exhibit A-4).

          Tenant agrees to an equitable allocation of the costs and expenses of
          maintaining, repairing and replacing the Mechanical System between
          Tenant and first and second floor tenants, on a pro-rata, square
          footage basis, so long as the Mechanical System serves the first and
          second floors and the Additional Expansion Space. Landlord and Tenant
          agree to cooperate in good faith to work with the first and second
          floor tenant with respect to the equitable allocation of costs and
          expenses and the use of the Mechanical System by the first and second
          floor tenant. Tenant acknowledges that the first or second floor
          tenant (currently Pathogenesis Inc.) shall maintain, repair and
          replace the Mechanical System for the benefit of Tenant and the first
          or second floor tenant. Tenant shall reimburse Pathogenesis Inc., the
          successor first or second floor tenant or Landlord (in the event
          Landlord has undertaken maintenance and repair responsibility) on a
          pro-rata square foot basis, for any and all maintenance, repair or
          replacement costs. Tenant shall pay Pathogenesis, Inc. (or the party
          maintaining the Mechanical System) such costs on a monthly basis based
          on estimates. All costs and expenses shall be reconciled on an annual
          basis.

          Tenant shall have the option of disconnecting certain of the
          Mechanical Systems servicing the Additional Expansion Space and
          instead servicing all or a portion of the Additional Expansion Space
          with Tenant's mechanical systems currently servicing other space in
          the Building leased by Tenant under the lease. In such event, tenants
          pro-rata square footage allocation of costs for maintaining and
          repairing the Mechanical Systems shall be reduced accordingly.

     5.2.6     To the extent that the Drawings and Specifications are
     anticipated to require further development by the Architect, the Contractor
     has provided in the Guaranteed Maximum Price for such further development
     consistent with the Contract Documents and reasonably inferable therefrom.
     Such further development does not include such things as changes in scope,
     systems, kinds and quality of materials, finishes or equipment, all of
     which, if required, shall be incorporated by Change Order.

ARTICLE 6      CHANGES IN THE WORK
     6.1       Adjustments to the Guaranteed Maximum Price on account of changes
     in the Work may be determined by any of the methods listed in AIA Document
     A201-1997 as amended.

     6.2       In calculating adjustments to subcontracts (except those awarded
     with the Owner's prior consent on the basis of cost plus a fee), the terms
     "cost" and "fee" as used in Clause 7.3.3.3 of AIA Document A201-1997 and
     the terms "costs" and "a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit" as
     used in Subparagraph 7.3.6 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall have the
     meanings assigned to them in AIA Document A201-1997 and shall not be
     modified by Articles 5,7 and 8 of this Agreement. Adjustments to
     subcontracts awarded with the Owner's prior consent on the basis of cost
     plus a fee shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of those
     subcontracts.

     6.3       In calculating adjustments to the Guaranteed Maximum Price, the
     terms "cost" and "costs" as used in the above-referenced provisions of AIA
     Document A201-1997 shall mean the Cost of the Work as defined in Article 7
     of this Agreement and the terms "fee" and "a reasonable allowance for
     overhead and profit" shall mean the Contractor's Fee as defined in
     Subparagraph 5.1.2 of this Agreement.

     6.4       If no specific provision is made in Paragraph 5.1 for adjustment
     of the Contractor's Fee in the case of changes in the Work, or if the
     extent of such changes is such, in the aggregate, that application of the
     adjustment provisions of Paragraph 5.1 will cause substantial inequity to
     the Owner or Contractor, the Contractor's Fee shall be equitably adjusted
     on the basis of the Fee established for the original Work, and the
     Guaranteed Maximum Price shall be adjusted accordingly.

ARTICLE 7      COSTS TO BE REIMBURSED
     7.1       COST OF THE WORK
     The term Cost of the Work shall mean costs necessarily incurred by the
     Contractor in the proper performance of the Work. Such costs shall be at
     rates not higher than the standard paid at the place of the Project except
     with prior consent of the Owner. The Cost of the Work shall include only
     the items set forth in this Article 7.

     7.2       LABOR COSTS
     7.2.1     Wages of construction workers directly employed by the Contractor
     to perform the construction of the Work at the site or, with the Owner's
     approval, at off-site workshops.

     7.2.2     Wages or salaries of the Contractor's supervisory and
     administrative personnel when stationed at the site with the Owner's
     approval.
     (If it is intended that the wages or salaries of certain personnel
     stationed at the Contractor's principal or other offices shall be included
     in the Cost of the Work, identify in Article 14 the personnel to be
     included and whether for all or only part of their time, and the rates at
     which their time will be charged to the Work.)

     7.2.3     Wages and salaries of the Contractor's supervisory or
     administrative personnel engaged, at factories, workshops or on the road,
     in expediting the production or transportation of materials or equipment
     required for the Work, but only for that portion of their time required for
     the Work of supervisory and administrative personnel, not to exceed __% of
     overall wages and salaries of supervisory and administrative personnel

     7.2.4     Costs paid or incurred by the Contractor for taxes, insurance,
     contributions, assessments and benefits required by law or collective
     bargaining agreements and, for personnel not covered by such agreements,

     provided in Subparagraph 7.5.2.

     8.1.6     Except as provided in Subparagraph 7.7.3 of this Agreement, costs
     due to the negligence or failure to fulfill a specific responsibility of
     the Contractor, Subcontractors and suppliers or anyone directly or
     indirectly employed by any of them or for whose acts any of them may be
     liable.

     8.1.7     Any cost not specifically and expressly described in Article 7.

     8.1.8     Costs, other than costs included in Change Orders approved by the
     Owner, that would cause the Guaranteed Maximum Price to be exceeded.

ARTICLE 9      DISCOUNTS, REBATES AND REFUNDS
     9.1       Trade discounts, rebates, refunds and amounts received from sales
     of surplus materials and equipment shall accrue to the Owner, and the
     Contractor shall make provisions so that they can be secured.

     9.2       Amounts that accrue to the Owner in accordance with the

     The Owner may designate specific persons or entities from whom the
     Contractor shall obtain bids. The Contractor shall obtain bids from
     Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated

     a bid that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without
     reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another bid be
     accepted, then the Contractor may require that a Change Order be issued to
     adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference between the bid of
     the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Contractor and the
     amount of the subcontract or other agreement actually signed with the
     person or entity designated by the Owner.

     10.3      Subcontracts or other agreements shall conform to the applicable
     payment provisions of this Agreement, and shall not be awarded on the basis
     of cost plus a fee without the prior consent of the Owner.

ARTICLE 11     ACCOUNTING RECORDS
     The Contractor shall keep full and detailed accounts and exercise such
     controls as may be necessary for proper financial management under this
     Contract, and the accounting and control systems shall be satisfactory to
     the Owner. The Owner and the Owner's accountants shall be afforded access

     Contract, and the Contractor shall preserve these for a period of three
     years after final payment, or for such longer period as may be required by
     law.

ARTICLE 12     PAYMENTS
     12.1      PROGRESS PAYMENTS
     12.1.1    Based upon Applications for Payment submitted to and approved by
     the Owner, the Owner shall make progress payments on account of the
     Contract Sum to the Contractor as provided below and elsewhere in the
     Contract Documents.

     12.1.2    The period covered by each Application for Payment shall be one
     calendar month ending on the last day of the month, or as follows:

     12.1.3    Provided that an Application for Payment is received by the Owner
     (and Owner has approved payment therefor) not later than the 25th day of a
     month, the Owner shall make payment to the Contractor not later than the
     15th day of the next month. If an Application for Payment is received by
     the Owner (and Owner has approved payment therefor) after the application
     date fixed above, payment shall be made by the Owner not later than 20 days
     after the Owner receives the Application for Payment.

     12.1.4    With each Application for Payment, the Contractor shall submit
     payrolls, petty cash accounts, receipted invoices or invoices with check
     vouchers attached, and any other evidence required by the Owner or
     Architect to demonstrate that cash disbursements already made by the
     Contractor on account of the Cost of the Work equal or exceed (1) progress
     payments already received by the Contractor; less (2) that portion of those
     payments attributable to the Contractor's Fee; plus (3) payrolls for the
     period covered by the present Application for Payment.

     12.1.5    Each Application for Payment shall be based on the most recent
     approved schedule of values submitted by the Contractor in accordance with
     the Contract Documents. The schedule of values shall allocate the entire
     Guaranteed Maximum Price among the various portions of the Work, except
     that the Contractor's Fee shall be shown as a single separate item. The
     schedule of values shall be prepared in such form and supported by such
     data to substantiate its accuracy as the Owner may require. This schedule,
     unless objected to by the Owner, shall be used as a basis for reviewing the
     Contractor's Applications for Payment.

     12.1.6    Applications for Payment shall show the percentage of completion
     of each portion of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the
     Application for Payment. The percentage of completion shall be the lesser
     of (1) the percentage of that portion of the Work which has actually been
     completed; or (2) the percentage obtained by dividing (a) the expense that
     has actually been incurred by the Contractor on account of that portion of
     the Work for which the Contractor has made or intends to make actual
     payment prior to the next Application for Payment by (b) the share of the
     Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in the
     schedule of values.

     12.1.7    Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount
     of each progress payment shall be computed as follows:

             .1  Each Application for Payment (other than the final Application
                 for Payment) shall include a sum equal to ninety-five percent
                 (95%) of the Cost of Work in place which was performed during
                 the period covered by the Application for Payment.

             .2  Each Application for Payment (other than the final Application
                 for Payment) shall also include a sum equal to ninety-five
                 percent (95%) of the Contractor's Fee as determined in
                 accordance with the provisions of Clause 5.1.1 to which
                 Contractor is entitled for the period covered by the
                 Application for Payment.

     Subparagraph 12.2.1 have been met, the Owner will, within 30 days after
     receipt of the written report of the Owner's accountants, either make final
     payment to the Contractor, or notify the Contractor in writing of the
     Owner's reasons for withholding such payment provided in Subparagraph
     9.5.1 of the AIA Document A201-1997. The time periods stated in this
     Subparagraph 12.2.3 supersede those stated in Subparagraph 9.4.1 of the AIA
     Document A201-1997.

     12.2.4    If the Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as
     substantiated by the Contractor's final accounting to be less than claimed
     by the Contractor the final payment shall be based upon such reduced
     amount, but, the Contractor shall be entitled to demand arbitration of the
     disputed amount without a further decision of the Architect. Such demand
     for arbitration shall be made by the Contractor within 45 days after the
     Owner's disapproval of all or a portion of an Application for Payment;
     failure to demand arbitration within this 45 day period shall result in the
     substantiated amount reported by the Owner's accountants becoming binding
     on the Contractor. Pending a final resolution by arbitration, the Owner
     shall pay the Contractor the amount approved by the Owner.

     12.2.5    If, subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the
     Contractor incurs costs described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article
     8 to correct defective or nonconforming Work, the Owner shall reimburse the
     Contractor such costs and the Contractor's Fee applicable thereto on the
     same basis as if such costs had been incurred prior to final payment, but
     not in excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price. If the Contractor has
     participated in savings as provided in Paragraph 5.2, the amount of such
     savings shall be recalculated and appropriate credit given to the Owner in
     determining the net amount to be paid by the Owner to the Contractor.

ARTICLE 13 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION
     13.1      The Contract may be terminated by the Contractor, or by the Owner
     for convenience, as provided in Article 14 of AIA Document A201-1997 as

                              GENERAL CONDITIONS OF

                          THE CONTRACT FOR CONSTRUCTION

                        (AIA Document A201-1997 Edition)

     THIS ADDENDUM TO GENERAL CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT FOR CONSTRUCTION is
entered into between__________________ ("Owner") and__________________
("Contractor") as an amendment and supplement to those certain General
Conditions of the Contract for Construction (AIA Document A201 - 1997 Edition)
that contain modifications made by Contractor (hereinafter "General
Conditions"), which has been incorporated by reference into that certain
Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor - Cost of the Work Plus
a Fee (AIA Document A111 - 1997 Edition) executed by Owner and Contractor
concurrently herewith (the "Agreement"). References in this Addendum to sections
of the General Conditions shall appear in this Addendum as "GC &___". Paragraphs
in this Addendum are numbered to correspond to the Articles in the General
Conditions to which such paragraphs in this Addendum generally relate. In the
event of any conflict between this Addendum and any other Contract Document,
this Addendum shall prevail; provided, however, that any typed or handwritten
additions to the printed form Agreement shall prevail over conflicting
provisions contained in this Addendum. This Addendum shall be deemed a part of
the Agreement.

1.A  DEFINITIONS. Unless otherwise provided in this Addendum, the capitalized
terms used in this Addendum shall have the meanings given to those terms in the
Contract Documents. In addition, the following terms shall have the following
meanings: (i) "Materials" shall mean materials, equipment, apparatus, articles,
or processes; (ii) "Laws" shall mean all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules,
regulations, building codes and orders; (iii) "Suppliers" shall mean all
materialmen or other persons providing Materials to Contractor or any
Subcontractor; (iv) "Claims" shall mean liabilities, judgments, claims, damages,
losses and expenses, of every type and nature, including but not limited to
attorneys' fees, experts' fees and court costs; and (v) "Lien" shall mean any
mechanics' or other lien, stop notice, charge, imposition, garnishment or
attachment.

1.B  CONTRACTOR AND ARCHITECT AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. GC &1.1.2. is modified
as follows: Contractor and Architect are independent contractors of Owner.
Neither Contractor nor Architect is the employee, agent, joint venturer, or
partner of Owner. The Contract Documents shall not be deemed to create any
relationship, express or implied, between Owner and any Subcontractor or
Supplier of Contractor. Contractor shall have the sole responsibility for
performance under any Subcontract or employment agreement entered into by
Contractor with respect to the Work.

1.C  DISCREPANCIES. The following is hereby added to GC & 1.2.1: Conflicts or
discrepancies among the Contract Documents shall be resolved in the following
order of priority:

.1 The Agreement;

.2 The General Conditions; and

.3 Drawings and specifications.

Amendments and revisions of later date take precedence over those of earlier
date. Drawings govern specifications for quantity and location and
specifications govern drawings for quality and performance. In the event of
ambiguity in quantity or quality, the greater quantity and the better quality
shall govern.

1.D  DRAWINGS. GC & 1.6.1 is modified as follows: Ownership of all drawings,
specifications and copies thereof furnished by Architect is determined by the
Architect's Agreement. They shall not be used on any other project without the
prior written consent of Owner.

<PAGE>

2.A  MODIFICATION OF OWNER'S  OBLIGATIONS.  GC &2.2.1 and GC &2.2.3 are deleted.
No action taken by Owner pursuant to the Contract Documents requires the
approval of Architect. However, Owner will not have control over or charge of,
and will not be responsible for, construction means, methods, techniques,
sequences or procedures, or for safety precautions and programs in connection
with the Work, since these are solely Contractor's responsibility as provided in
the Contract Documents. Owner will not be responsible for Contractor's failure
to carry out the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents. Owner will not
have control over or charge of, and will not be responsible for, negligent acts
or omissions of Contractor, Subcontractors, or their agents or employees, or of
any other persons performing portions of the Work.

2.B  OWNER'S RIGHT TO STOP THE WORK. GC &2.3.1 is deleted and replaced with the
following, which rights shall be in addition to, and not in restriction of,
other rights and remedies given to Owner:

     2.B.1 Suspension Due to Unforeseen Conditions. Notwithstanding any
provision in the Contract Documents to the contrary, if suspension of the Work
is warranted by reason of unforeseen conditions which may adversely affect the
quality of the Work, if the Work were continued, Owner (but not Architect) by
written notice to Contractor may do either or both of the following, to the
extent necessary to address such unforeseen conditions: (i) entirely suspend the
Work; or (ii) cause the Work, or portions thereof, to be partially suspended or
delayed, while other portions of the Work continue on the same or different
schedule re-determined by Owner and Contractor. In such event, the Contract Time
shall be extended by the amount of delay caused by the exercise by Owner of such
remedies. In addition, if Contractor has taken all reasonable steps to mitigate
the effects of such suspension, then Contractor shall be entitled to
reimbursement of its reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket, additional general
conditions costs resulting from such suspension. If Contractor reasonably
believes that a suspension of the Work is warranted by reason of unforeseen
circumstances which may adversely affect the quality of the Work, if the Work
were continued, Contractor shall immediately notify Owner and Architect of such
belief, but Contractor shall have no right to suspend the Work, except with the
written consent of Owner (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or
except in the case of an emergency (in which event Contractor shall resume work
upon cessation of the emergency).

     2.B.2 Upon Contractor's Default. Notwithstanding any provision in the
Contract Documents to the contrary, if Contractor fails to correct defective
Work as required by GC PARA 12.2, fails to complete the Work on time as required
by the Agreement, or is in material default of its obligations hereunder, Owner
may order Contractor to stop the Work, or any portion thereof, until the cause
for such order has been eliminated pursuant to GC PARA 14.B.2, hereof.

3.A  REVIEW BY CONTRACTOR. GC PARA 3.2.2 (second sentence only) and GC PARA
3.2.3 (third sentence only) are deleted and the remainder of GC PARA 3.2 is
modified as follows: Contractor acknowledges that it is responsible for
inspecting all Site conditions, Contract Documents, and other matters which may
affect the prosecution, completion, and Cost of the Work (herein, the
"Conditions of the Work"). Contractor represents to Owner that: (i) Contractor
has inspected and tested to the extent necessary for its purposes, the
Conditions of the Work; (ii) Contractor's knowledge of the Conditions of the
Work as of the execution of the Agreement is sufficient to enable Contractor to
determine the Cost of the Work; and (iii) to the best of Contractor's knowledge,
the Work described in the Contract Documents can be performed in strict
compliance with all Laws. Contractor also shall review specified construction
and installation procedures and shall advise Architect prior to commencing
related activities, if any such procedures would result in finished Work not in
conformance with the Contract Documents or if such procedures would affect any
warranties, and Contractor shall propose alternative procedures which will
comply with the Contract Documents and which Contractor will warrant. The last
two sentences of GC PARA 3.3.1 are deleted.

3.B  LABOR AND MATERIALS. GC PARA 3.4  is supplemented as follows: Neither
Contractor nor any Subcontractor or Supplier shall incorporate into the Work any
Materials (i) to which its title is imperfect, (ii) against which there is any
claim by a manufacturer or other entity, or (iii) which is encumbered by any
security interest. Contractor shall be responsible for all Materials specified
by the Contract Documents which are delivered to the Site. Any Materials
delivered to the Site, which are not to be used in or

                                        2

<PAGE>

incorporated into the Work under the Contract Documents, shall be forthwith
removed from the Site and Contractor shall be solely responsible for all cost
incurred with respect to such Materials.

3.C  CONTRACTOR'S WARRANTY. The word "may" in the second sentence of GC PARA
3.5.1 is replaced with the word, "shall," and the remainder of GC PARA 3.5.1 is
modified and supplemented as follows: Contractor's warranty shall include all
specified procedures or accepted alternative procedures and all specified or
accepted substituted products. The Contractor shall also use all reasonable
efforts to secure from the Subcontractors, for the benefit of Owner, the maximum
warranties available with respect to such Subcontractor's Work; provided,
however, that any additional cost of such warranties shall be approved in
writing by Owner. During the one-year period following Substantial Completion of
the Work, the Contractor shall, upon request by Owner, use its best efforts to
obtain satisfaction of any Subcontractor's warranty. Neither (a) the lapse of
the lapse of an express warranty period under any Subcontract or under GC PARA
12.2.2, nor (b) Owner's failure to assert a warranty claim under any Subcontract
or GC PARA 12.2.2, shall waive any right or action (other than the particular
warranty claim so waived) which Owner may have against Contractor or any
Subcontractor for defective or incomplete Work under any other provision of a
Subcontract or the Contract Documents, or otherwise under applicable Law. All
guaranties and warranties of Materials used or incorporated into the Work shall
be assigned and delivered by Contractor to Owner upon demand, or without demand
upon completion of the Work. The warranties in Contract Documents or assigned to
Owner (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other warranty or guaranty,
whether express or implied, (ii) shall survive the completion of the Work and
the termination of the Contract Documents, and (iii) shall inure to the benefit
of Owner's successors and assigns.

3.D  PERMITS, FEES AND NOTICES. GC PARA 3.7.1 is supplemented as follows:
Contractor shall furnish to Owner copies of all permits obtained during the
course of the Work.

3.E  COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. GC PARA 3.7.3 and 3.7.4 are modified and supplemented
as follows: Contractor shall comply with all Laws applicable to the performance
of the Work and the employment of labor. Although Contractor is not responsible
for the preparation of Drawings and Specifications, Contractor shall
nevertheless (i) notify Owner and Architect of any deviation in the Drawings and
Specifications from the requirements of applicable Law of which Contractor is or
reasonably should be aware, and (ii) perform no Work which Contractor knows or
reasonably should know to be contrary to applicable Law. Owner acknowledges that
city or county building officials may refuse to approve components of the Work
even if Contractor has complied with applicable Law.

3.F  SUPERINTENDENT. GC PARA 3.9 is modified as follows: All of Contractor's
supervisory personnel at the Site shall be satisfactory to Owner, and Contractor
shall replace such personnel only with Owner's consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

3.G  PROGRESS SCHEDULE AND ON-SITE MEETINGS. Contractor shall strictly adhere to
the progress schedule approved by Owner and Architect and shall immediately
notify Owner and Architect of any material deviation by any party from said
schedule. If, in the judgment of Architect or Owner, any phase of the Work is or
may become behind schedule, Contractor shall take such steps as Owner deems
reasonably necessary to improve the progress of the Work and insure Substantial
Completion of the Work within the Contract Time. Upon request by Architect or
Owner, Contractor shall submit for their approvals a revised progress schedule
showing the manner in which any lost time will be regained. Contractor shall
hold weekly progress meetings at the Site, or at such other time, frequency, and
location as are reasonably acceptable to Owner. Progress of the Work shall be
reported in detail with reference to construction schedules prepared by and
approved by Owner and Architect. Upon request by Owner; Contractor shall cause
each interested Subcontractor to attend the meeting for the purposes of
reporting upon the progress of the Subcontractor's Work and receiving
information; provided, however, that nothing that may transpire at such meeting
shall modify or release any Subcontractor from its obligations to the Contractor
under a Subcontract.

3.H  SUBMITTALS. All changes made to the original preprinted form of the General
Conditions in GC PARA 3.l2.7, 3.12.8, 3.12.9 and 3.12.10 are deleted and the
original preprinted form language is reinstated.

                                        3

<PAGE>

3.I  USE OF SITE. GC PARA 3.13 is supplemented as follows: In performing the
Work, Contractor shall not cause or allow rain water, dust, nauseous vapors,
excessive noise, or other intrusions to go beyond the boundaries of the Site in
any manner that would constitute a nuisance or a violation of Law.

3.J  CLEANING UP. GC PARA 3.15 is supplemented. Upon completion of the Work,
Contractor shall remove from the Site and sell to a third party or transfer to
itself at the fair market value all machinery, equipment, scaffolding, forms,
hand tools and other items which were purchased exclusively for use in the Work
and charged to Owner as a cost of the Project, which Owner does not elect to
retain. Proceeds from such sales, or the fair market value of the item in the
case of a transfer to Contractor, shall be deducted from the Contract Sum
payable to Contractor.

3.K  LABOR RELATIONS.

     3.K.1 Labor Agreements. Employment of labor by Contractor shall be effected
under conditions which are satisfactory to Owner. If Owner has entered into any
labor agreements covering work at the Site, Owner shall inform Contractor of the
terms of such labor agreements and Contractor shall comply with all of the terms
and conditions of those labor agreements, including (i) the trust fund payments
into the respective trust funds set forth in the respective labor agreements in
so far as Contractor may lawfully do so, and (ii) any provisions setting forth
the jurisdiction and the scope of work claimed by each of such crafts and the
procedure contained therein for resolution of jurisdictional disputes. In the
absence of any such procedure, or if such procedure fails to promptly resolve
any jurisdictional dispute, Contractor agrees, at its own cost, upon request of
Owner, to take any and all lawful steps to secure binding and final
determination of said jurisdictional dispute by the National Labor Relations
Board. Should there be picketing on the Site and if Owner establishes a reserved
gate for Contractor's purposes, Contractor shall continue the proper performance
of the Work, without interruption or delay, using such gate.

     3.K.2 Equal Opportunity. Contractor and the Subcontractors shall not
discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of
handicap, age, religion, color, sex, or national origin. Contractor shall take
affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and that employees
are treated during employment, without regard to their handicap, age, race,
religion, color, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be
limited to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion, transfer,
recruitment, advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of
compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Contractor
shall post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for
employment, notices setting forth its policies of non-discrimination. Contractor
and each Subcontractor shall, in all solicitations or advertisements for
employees placed by them or on their behalf, state that all qualified applicants
will receive consideration for employment without regard to handicap, age, race,
religion, color, sex or national origin. Contractor will not discriminate in the
selection of Subcontractors or Suppliers because of age, sex, race, creed,
color, national origin, age, or handicap. Contractor will, in the selection of
Suppliers and in the award of Subcontracts, use its best efforts to identify
qualified minority business enterprises, and to assure that such enterprises
shall have the maximum practicable opportunity for selection by Contractor.
Contractor shall inform Owner in writing as to any such enterprises that have
been so identified.

3.L  ACCESS TO WORK; ROYALTIES, PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS. All changes to the
original preprinted form language in GC PARA 3.17 and 3.18 are deleted and the
original preprinted form language in these sections is reinstated.

3.M  MECHANICS' LIENS. GC  PARA 3.18.1 is supplemented. Contractor shall pay
when due all sums payable to persons or firms who furnish labor, or Materials
for the Work or who are otherwise entitled to file a mechanic's Lien upon
Owner's property. Except to the extent attributable to Owner's wrongful
withholding of monies payable to Contractor under the Contract Documents, within
five (5) business days following Owner's written demand, Contractor shall take
such action as may be required to discharge any Lien against Owner or the
landlord of the premises ("Landlord") or Owner's or Landlord's real property in
connection with the Work and Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless Owner,
Landlord and their real property from and against any and all Claims arising out
of the filing or service, or attempted filing or

                                        4

<PAGE>

service, of any Lien or out of Contractor's failure to remove or satisfy any
Lien in accordance with this Contract. Except to the extent caused solely by
Owner's wrongful withholding of the amounts due and payable to Contractor,
Contractor shall not (i) file or record, or suffer the filing or recording of,
any Lien upon Owner's or Landlord's real property, (ii) shall not impose, or
suffer the imposition of, any stop notice on funds held by Owner, or Landlord
and (iii) shall not garnish or attach, or suffer the garnishment or attachment
of, any funds held by Owner or Landlord.

3.N  INDEMNIFICATION. GC PARA 13.18.1 is modified to provide that to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, Contractor will indemnify, protect, defend and hold
harmless Owner and its consultants, agents and employees and Landlord from all
Claims to the extent the Claim arises out of (i) any negligent or willful act or
omission of Contractor, any Subcontractor, or any one directly or indirectly
employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable,
regardless of whether or not the Claim also is caused in part by Owner or
Architect, and/or (ii) a breach of Contractor's obligations or representations
under the Contract Documents, except only to the extent that the Claims were
caused by the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the Owner. All of the
foregoing indemnifications in the Contract shall be in full force and effect and
apply at all times during the progress of the Work and, notwithstanding the
Substantial Completion of the Work, the filing of a Notice of Completion, or the
termination of the Contract Documents, at all times thereafter. Contractor
agrees, at its own cost, expense and risk to defend the Owner and its
consultants, agents and employees against any such Claim that may be brought by
a governmental authority, any employee of Contractor or any of Contractor's
Subcontractors or Material Suppliers, or any other third person with counsel
selected by the indemnified party subject to the consent of Contractor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Contractor fails to provide such
defense, then in addition to its other rights and remedies at law or in equity
or under the Contract Documents, the party(ies) to be indemnified may defend the
same and all attorneys' and experts' fees, court costs and other expenses of
every kind incurred by the indemnified party to provide such defense, together
with the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party on any judgement or
settlement of the Claim shall be paid by Contractor to the indemnified party
upon demand. Contractor acknowledges and agrees that the indemnity herein
provided shall not be limited in any way by a limitation on the amount or type
of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for the Contractor under any
workers' compensation, disability or other employee benefit act.

3.O  SIGNAGE. Except as approved by Owner, neither Contractor nor any of its
agents, contractors or employees shall post any signs at the Project. All signs
shall comply with all applicable Laws.

4.A  ARCHITECT'S RESPONSIBILITIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Contract Documents, (including without limitation GC PARA l.1.2, 4.1, 4.2,
and 4.4) Architect may be replaced by Owner at any time, and from time to time,
by written notice to Contractor, and Owner shall (i) have the right to exercise
any right or power given to Architect by the Contract Documents, which Owner may
do either in conjunction with Architect or by itself without consultation with
or involvement of Architect, and (ii) receive or obtain any notices, plans, or
other documents Architect is entitled to receive or obtain pursuant to the
Contract Documents, and (iii) communicate directly with Contractor. Except as
Owner may hereafter notify Contractor in writing, Architect shall have no right
to act on behalf of Owner, to provide any approval for Owner, or to otherwise
bind Owner to any action or promise. Architect's approval, decision, or
determination as to any matter is advisory only and shall not be binding upon
Owner. If Architect requests additional inspection, testing, labor, materials or
other Work, Owner shall not be bound to pay the cost thereof, unless Owner has
agreed in writing to do so. Nothing in the Contract shall limit Architect's
duties under the Architect's Agreement.

4.B  CONSTRUCTION OBSERVATION. In GC PARA 4.2.2, the word "Work" means only the
product of construction and does not include Contractor's equipment, services,
construction means, methods, techniques, sequences, procedures, or safety
precautions or programs.

4.C  CLAIMS.

     4.C.1 Time Limits on Claims. GC PARA 4.3.1, PARA 4.3.2 and GC PARA 4.4.5
(second sentence) are deleted. Claims by Contractor must be made within 30 days
after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or within

                                        5

<PAGE>

30 days after Contractor first recognizes the condition giving rise to the
Claim, whichever is later. Claims must be made by written notice. Failure to
deliver any such notice or request within the required period shall constitute
an irrevocable waiver of any such Claim. If a Claim has been implemented by
Change Order, no further consideration will be given to such Claim.

     4.C.2 Resolution of Claims. GC PARA 4.3 and 4.4 are modified and
supplemented as set forth herein. All references to "arbitration" are deleted.
In the event of any dispute between Owner and Contractor, which relates to the
Contract Documents or the Work, Contractor shall not interrupt the progress of
the Work during the pendency of any such dispute, unless ordered to do so by
Owner in writing. If either party becomes involved in litigation in connection
with the Contract Documents or the Work, the court or tribunal in such
litigation, or in a separate suit, may award reasonable costs and expenses of
litigation, including court costs, experts' fees and attorneys' fees, to be paid
by the losing party to the prevailing party. In the event either party becomes
the subject of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the other parties shall
be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and expenses, including attorneys'
fees and court costs, incurred by said other party to obtain adequate protection
of its rights under the Contract Documents or to obtain other requested relief
in such bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

4.D  MEDIATION. GC PARA 4.5 is modified and supplemented as follows: If a
dispute arises out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, and
if such dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, the parties shall
submit the dispute to nonbinding mediation under the Construction Industry
Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association before having recourse
to a judicial forum. The mediation may be initiated by the written request of
either party and shall be commenced within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such
notice.

4.E  ARBITRATION. GC PARA 4.6 is deleted.

5.   SUBCONTRACTORS. GC PARA 5.2.3 is deleted. The fourth sentence of GC PARA
5.3.1 shall end with the words "...will be bound," and the remainder of said
sentence is deleted. GC PARA 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 are supplemented. Owner, acting
reasonably and in good faith after consultation with Contractor, may require
Contractor to terminate a Subcontractor and replace the Subcontractor with
another Subcontractor acceptable to Owner. If at such time Contractor is not in
default hereunder, the Contract Sum shall be increased or decreased by the
difference in cost occasioned by such change and the Contract Time shall be
equitably adjusted. Work performed for Contractor by a Subcontractor shall be
performed only pursuant to a written subcontract between Contractor and
Subcontractor in a form reasonably acceptable to Owner. Each subcontract shall
provide that (i) Subcontractor waives all rights it may have against Owner for
damages caused by fire or other perils which would be covered by the property
insurance described in the Contract Documents or which is otherwise covered by
insurance; (ii) Subcontractor will furnish such additional lien waivers and
other documents as Owner and Contractor may reasonably request; and (iii)
require the Subcontractor to perform strictly in accordance with the Contract
Documents (including specifically, but without limiting the generality of the
foregoing the labor and employment relations provision thereof). In addition,
all Suppliers and Subcontractors shall warrant the Work and Materials supplied
and/or installed by them in the same manner and for the same period as is
required of Contractor under this Contract or in such broader manner and for
such longer period as may be required by the Specifications. Contractor and all
Subcontractors shall coordinate their Work with all adjacent work and all other
trades so as to facilitate the general progress of all work. Each Subcontractor
shall afford all other contractors every reasonable opportunity to install other
work and materials. All Subcontractors shall be required to place all debris in
a central location.

7.A  INITIAL AUTHORIZATION OF WORK. GC PARA 7.1 is modified to delete all
references to or any "major or minor change in the Work, other than a Change
Order or a Construction Change Directive."

7.B  SUBCONTRACTOR OVERHEAD AND PROFIT. The following is added as GC PARA 7.2.3:

"7.2.3 In no event shall the total Change Order markup, including all levels of
Subcontractors' overhead and profit and Contractor overhead and profit exceed
twelve percent (12%) cumulative."

                                        6

<PAGE>

7.C. CHANGE ORDER FOR NEW WORK. The following is hereby added as GC PARA 7.2.4:
From time to time during the term of this Contract, Owner may elect in its
discretion to submit to Contractor Drawings and Specifications for portions of
the Work. Upon receipt of such Drawings and Specifications, Contractor shall
immediately obtain bids for such Work. Based on bids approved by Owner,
Contractor shall deliver to Owner a proposed Change Order for the Work described
in the Drawings and Specifications so delivered to Contractor. If after
requesting bids, Owner and Contractor are unable to agree upon the terms of a
Change Order for the Work, Owner may rescind its request for Work and may obtain
performance of the Work by others. Contractor shall be authorized to undertake
only those portions of the Work authorized in writing by Owner in a written
Change Order complying with this section or otherwise as authorized by this
Contract. Each Change Order initially authorizing Work shall (i) describe the
Work to be performed and reference the Drawings, Specifications and any other
additional Contract Documents applicable to such Work, (ii) set forth the
adjustment to the Contract Sum proposed by Contractor and approved by Owner for
such Work, and (iii) specify any modification of the Substantial Completion Date
as a consequence of the Change Order.

7.D  SUBSEQUENT MODIFICATIONS. The following is hereby added as GC PARA 7.2.5:

     "7.2.5 Subsequent Modifications. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in GC PARA 7.2, the Contract Sum may be adjusted and the Contract
Time may be extended or shortened only upon written approval of a Change Order
by Owner and Contractor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in GC PARA
7.1.2, Change Orders shall be ineffective unless executed by Owner. Each Change
Order for adjustments in previously authorized Work shall include (i) a cost
breakdown for the maximum increase or decrease in the Contract Sum as a
consequence of a Change, (ii) a description of all plans and specifications for
the Change, and (iii) the adjustment, if any, in the Contract Time as a
consequence of the Change."

7.E  RIGHT TO PAYMENT. The following is hereby added as GC PARA 7.2.6:

     "7.2.6 Right to Payment. Contractor shall not be entitled to include in any
Application for Payment, or to receive payment for, Work, unless the Work is
authorized by a valid Change Order executed by Owner. No course of conduct or
dealings between the parties, nor express or implied acceptance of alterations
or additions to the Work, and no claim that Owner has been unjustly enriched by
any alteration or addition to the Work, whether or not there is in fact any such
unjust enrichment, shall be the basis for a change in the Contract Time, an
increase in the Contract Sum or the Guaranteed Maximum Price, or a right to any
other payment by Owner to Contractor. Contractor shall complete all Work
specified in Change Orders executed by Owner and Contractor in accordance with
the Contract Documents on or before the scheduled Substantial Completion Date
specified in the Change Orders."

7.F  PRICING FOR CHANGE ORDERS. The change in the Contract Sum Sum or the
Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Work authorized by each Change Order, shall be
equal to: the sum of the total actual net increase or decrease in the Cost of
the Work based upon Subcontractor's bids and bid revisions approved by
Contractor and Owner for the Change in the Work, if such bids are available, or
in all other cases based upon Owner's and Contractor's estimate of the actual
labor and Materials added or saved by the Change Order.

8.A  DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION. GC PARA 8.1.3 and 9.8 are amended
modified and supplemented as follows: "Substantial Completion" of any portion of
the Work is the date when (i) such Work is substantially complete as set forth
in a written certification executed by Architect and approved by Owner, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) Contractor has delivered
to Owner all permits and approvals from the appropriate governmental authorities
necessary for the occupancy of such Work for Owner's intended use, and (iii)
there remains no incomplete or defective item of such Work that would adversely
affect Owner's intended use of such Work. The last two sentences of GC PARA
9.8.5 are deleted.

8.B  PROGRESS AND NOTICE OF COMPLETION. GC PARA 8.2 is modified and supplemented
as follows: Not later than five (5) days following Substantial Completion of the
Work, Contractor shall submit a properly drafted Notice of Completion to Owner
for Owner's signature. If the Work is

                                        7

<PAGE>

Substantially Complete, Owner shall sign, acknowledge, and return the form to
Contractor within five (5) days following receipt of the notice. Contractor
shall cause the executed Notice of Completion to be properly recorded at the
County Recorder's Office of the county in which the Site is located on or before
the tenth (10th) day following Substantial Completion of the Work. Within five
(5) days following recording, Contractor shall deliver to Owner a copy of the
recorded Notice of Completion, certified by the County Recorder to be a copy of
the recorded original and indicating the date and time the Notice of Completion
was recorded.

8.C CLAIM OF DELAY. GC PARA 8.3.1 is deleted. If Contractor is delayed in the
performance of the Work beyond the scheduled Substantial Completion Date set
forth in the Agreement by any Excusable Delay (as defined below), then such
date(s) shall be extended by Change Order for such reasonable time as is
appropriate under the circumstances, as approved by Owner and Contractor, which
approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. No event of Excusable Delay shall
be deemed to have occurred, unless Contractor delivers a written claim of
justifiable delay to Owner and Architect within twenty-one (21) days following
the commencement of the delay. Immediately upon commencement of a delay,
Contractor shall take all steps reasonably available to lessen the adverse
impact of such delay upon Owner.

As used herein, "Excusable Delay" means an actual delay in the performance of
the Work by Contractor caused by any of the following if such events are beyond
the reasonable control of Contractor despite having taken all reasonable
attempts to avoid such delay and to prevent and mitigate the effects thereof:

.1        Actions of Owner, or of any employee, agent, representative or
separate contractor of Owner, or Architect (other than by reason of the proper
exercise of their respective rights, duties and obligations under the Contract
Documents); or

.2        Fire, flood, war, embargo, sabotage, earthquake, or by injunction (not
the fault of Contractor) or other unavoidable damage to the Work not the fault
of Contractor.

.3        Unusually severe weather in accordance with GC PARA 4.3.7.2, as
modified by Paragraph 4.C of this Addendum; or

.4        General strike, regulatory delays (not caused by Contractor), strikes
and/or losses during transportation.

GC PARA 8.3.2 is modified as follows: Claims relating to time shall be made in
accordance with applicable provisions of Paragraph 4.3. Contractor shall have no
remedy for any delay other than an Excusable Delay. In addition to a time
extension, Contractor shall be entitled to reimbursement of its reasonable,
direct, out-of-pocket, additional general conditions costs resulting from any
Excusable Delay, provided, however, that in no event will Contractor be entitled
to recover any damages, additional profit or fee, or any other costs, other than
the forgoing additional general conditions costs.

9.A  PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTOR. GC PARA 9 is amended and supplemented as follows:
Copies of all Applications for Payment shall be submitted to Owner no later than
the last day of any calendar month for any period preceding such date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Construction Documents, the
parties acknowledge that Architect will not review or issue Certificates for
Payment, and that Owner shall be entitled to review all Applications for Payment
without consulting with Architect. Owner shall be entitled to withhold amounts
included in an Application for Payment if Owner does not approve such amount as
set forth in this Section 9. Contractor shall submit to Owner the Application
for Payment and all notices and documents required in the Contract Documents to
be provided to Architect in connection with its review of the Application for
Payment or the issuance of a Certificate for Payment. If requested by Owner,
each Application for Payment (after the first) shall be accompanied by an
accounting of the disbursement of funds previously received by Contractor from
Owner, certified to be true and correct by Contractor. Upon the reasonable
request of Owner, such accounting also shall itemize all disbursements to
Subcontractors and Suppliers and Contractor shall deliver to Owner copies of all
vendors' invoices, payroll and other data substantiating actual expenditures by
Contractor for the Work, and upon reasonable request, shall allow Owner to
inspect the books and records of Contractor relating to such expenditures. In
each

                                        8

<PAGE>

Application for Payment, Contractor shall certify that: (i) the requested
payment represents a just determination of the actual amount payable to
Contractor under the Contract Documents; (ii) the information set forth in the
Application for Payment is correct; (iii) the Contract, to the best of
Contractor's knowledge, is in full force and effect and free from default by any
party (or if Owner is in default, the nature of the default); (iv) any
contingency reserve under the Contract has or has not been utilized, and if
utilized, the amount that remains; (v) all Subcontractors and Suppliers have
been paid all sums that are due and payable to them in full (excluding payments
due which are included in the Application for Payment in question); (vi)
Contractor shall promptly pay all sums due and payable to Subcontractors,
unions, laborers, and Suppliers out of funds to be received pursuant to the
Application for Payment; (vii) no Lien currently affects the Work nor is there
any basis for the filing of a Lien with respect to Work, other than Liens caused
solely by Owner's wrongful withholding of amounts due Contractor under the
Contract or Liens for the Work included in the Application for Payment; (viii)
all amounts due and payable with respect to the Work either have been paid to
date or are included in the Application for Payment; and (ix) partial waivers of
mechanic's liens totaling the amounts previously paid by Owner to Contractor
have been obtained from all Subcontractors and Suppliers in such form as to
constitute an effective waiver, under applicable Law, of all Lien rights with
respect to the Work.

9.B  LIEN RELEASES. GC PARA 9.3 is supplemented as follows: Each Application for
Payment shall be accompanied by partial releases of mechanic's Liens in the form
required or authorized by applicable Washington law for Work costing not less
than the amount of the Contract Sum (less retention) previously paid by Owner to
Contractor and conditional releases of Liens in the form required or authorized
by applicable Washington law for the payments requested in the Application for
Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Owner have any
obligation to see to the proper disposition or application of monies paid by
Owner to Contractor.

9.C  MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT. The following is added as
GC PARA 9.3.1.3: Each Application for Payment (other than the final Application
for Payment) shall be in the sum not to exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of the
Cost of the Work performed during the preceding month. In no event shall the
total Contractor's Fee included in all Applications for Payment (other than the
final Application for Payment) exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of the total
Contractor's Fee payable pursuant to the Contract Documents and in no event
shall the total Cost of the Work payable pursuant to all Applications for
Payment (other than the final Application for Payment) exceed ninety-five
percent (95%) of the Guaranteed Maximum Price as of the date of the Application
for Payment.

9.D  PAYMENT FOR MATERIAL. GC PARA 9.3.2 is deleted and replaced with the
following: Payments will be made on account of Materials only when such
Materials have either been (i) incorporated in the Work, or (ii) suitably stored
in a bonded warehouse acceptable to Owner and warehouse receipts therefore have
been delivered to Owner.

9.E  OWNER'S OBLIGATION TO PAY CONTRACTOR. GC PARA 9.4 is deleted and GC PARA
9.5.1 and 9.5.2 are replaced as follows: All Materials, finishes and processes
shall be subject to rejection for just cause by Owner. Acceptance or rejection
of a Material, finish or process shall be expressed only in writing. Any
provision of the Contract Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Owner also
shall have no obligation to pay Contractor amounts otherwise payable under this
Contract if (i) any of the following circumstances has occurred, (ii) the
occurrence of such circumstances is not solely caused by Owner's wrongful
withholding of amounts payable to Contractor under this Contract, and (iii) such
circumstances have not been remedied or eliminated to Owner's reasonable
satisfaction:

     A. Contractor has failed to make any payment due to Contractor's
     Subcontractors and Suppliers for the material and labor used in the Work;
     or

     B. A claim of Lien has been recorded against Owner's real property, a stop
     notice has been served on Owner, or funds of Owner have been garnished or
     attached in connection with the Work unless Contractor has supplied Owner
     with an acceptable bond; or

                                        9

<PAGE>

     C. Reasonable evidence indicates a probability (i) that a claim of Lien
     will be recorded, a stop notice will be served, or funds of Owner will be
     garnished or attached, or (ii) that Contractor has otherwise failed to make
     payments to Subcontractors and Suppliers, unless Contractor has supplied
     Owner with an acceptable bond; or

     D. Owner, in its reasonable good faith judgment, determines that the unpaid
     amount of the Contract Sum plus the cost of any necessary but pending
     Change Orders (after payment of the amount requested in the Application for
     Payment) will not be sufficient to complete the Work in accordance with the
     Drawings and Specifications, in which case Contractor shall perform so much
     of the Work at its sole cost as is necessary to insure that the unpaid
     amount of the Contract Sum plus the cost of any necessary but pending
     Change Orders will be sufficient to complete the Work before Owner shall be
     obligated to make any further payments to Contractor; or

     F. Contractor has failed to perform an obligation on its part to be
     performed under the Contract Documents or under any other contract between
     Contractor and Owner; or

     G. Neither Contractor nor its insurance carrier has reimbursed Owner for
     damage caused to Owner or any other contractor as a consequence of a
     default by Contractor or the acts or omissions of Contractor, or its
     agents, employees, Subcontractors or Suppliers; or

     H. Owner, in its reasonable good faith judgment, determines that the Work
     will not be completed within the Contract Time (as extended by Excusable
     Delays) through no fault of Owner or Architect; or

     I. Contractor persistently and unreasonably fails to carry out the Work in
     accordance with the Contract Documents.

Until all of the foregoing circumstances are remedied to Owner's satisfaction,
Owner may withhold the amount necessary in Owner's reasonable opinion to protect
Owner from the loss that may be occasioned thereby and, if applicable, may
demand reimbursement of amounts previously paid by Owner to Contractor as
necessary to avoid loss to Owner. When all of the foregoing circumstances are
satisfactorily remedied, payments previously withheld by Owner shall be paid to
Contractor.

9.F  METHOD OF PAYMENTS. GC PARA 9.6.1 is deleted. With reasonable cause, Owner
shall have the right to pay Contractor by joint check made payable to Contractor
and any Subcontractor or Supplier to whom all or a portion of such funds may be
due; provided, however, that (i) Contractor shall have no obligation to make
payments by joint check, and (ii) its election to do so in any case shall not
constitute an obligation by Owner to any Subcontractor or Supplier to do so in
the future nor create any contractual relationship whatsoever between Owner and
any Subcontractor or Supplier.

9.G  REVIEW OF APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT. GC PARA 9.7.1 is deleted and replaced by
the following: Owner may review each Application for Payment and may make such
exceptions, by written notice to Contractor, as Owner reasonably deems necessary
or appropriate under the circumstances then existing. Owner may withhold a
payment to Contractor to the extent that it relates to the correction of an
exception reasonably taken by Owner. If Contractor disputes any exception to the
Application for Payment taken by Owner, Contractor shall nevertheless continue
to diligently prosecute the Work and shall notify Owner of its dispute in
writing. If Contractor fails to deliver a written statement disputing an
exception to an Application for Payment taken by Owner within fourteen (14) days
following notice to Contractor of the exception, Contractor shall be
conclusively presumed to have accepted Owner's exception to the Application for
Payment. Owner shall not be deemed in breach of this Contract by reason of
withholding any payment pursuant to any provision of the Contract Documents,
provided (i) Owner has acted in good faith, (ii) Architect has approved Owner's
action, and/or (iii) the Work in question has been rejected by any governmental
authority.

9.H  OWNER'S RIGHT TO PAY SUBCONTRACTOR. If any Subcontractor disputes any
decision of Contractor with regard to any portion of the Work performed by such
Subcontractor, and Contractor has elected not to pay such Subcontractor as a
result of such dispute, in addition to its other rights, Owner shall

                                       10

<PAGE>

have the right, in Owner's sole discretion, and after consultation with
Contractor, to pay all or any portion of any amount so claimed by such
Subcontractor unless Contractor supplies Owner with a bond acceptable to Owner
to protect Owner from the dispute. If any Subcontractor, laborer or materialman
asserts any Claim against Contractor, whether or not related to the Work,
Contractor shall take all steps reasonably necessary to protect the Work from
such Claim, including obtaining all assurances otherwise required by the
Contract Documents; and any and all costs incurred by Contractor in connection
therewith shall not be deemed part of the Contract Sum and Owner shall have no
liability therefor, so long as the Claim is not caused by Owner's wrongful
failure to pay the sums payable to Contractor under the Contract Documents.

9.I  FINAL COMPLETION. GC PARA 9.10.4 is deleted. GC PARA 9.10 is supplemented
as follows:

     9.I.1 Punch List. Immediately prior to the Substantial Completion of the
Work, Contractor shall notify Architect and Owner that the Project is ready for
final inspection. Within ten (10) working days following Contractor's notice
that it believes that the Work is substantially complete, Architect and Owner
shall conduct an inspection of the Work and forward to Contractor a
"punch-list", indicating items of the Work requiring completion and items of
unsatisfactory Work. The omission of an item from the "punch-list" shall not
relieve Contractor of its obligation to meet the requirements of this Contract.
All items on the "punch-list" (except for minor, corrective items which do not
in any way interfere with Owner's use and occupancy of the Work) shall be
completed and/or corrected by Contractor to the satisfaction of Architect and
Owner prior to submission of the final Application for Payment.

     9.I.2 Final Payment. Owner shall have no obligation to pay the unpaid
balance of the Contract Sum until (i) the Work and all "punch-list" items have
been completed in accordance with this Contract; (ii) Owner has accepted the
Work and all "punch-list" items; (iii) Contractor has delivered to Owner a
waiver of Lien rights, complying with applicable Law, conditioned only upon
receipt of the funds requested in the final Application for Payment, and
executed by Contractor and by each person or entity entitled to record a claim
of Lien against Owner's real property (or, if any Subcontractor or Supplier
refuses to furnish such waiver, then a Lien bond in form, substance, and amount
satisfactory to Owner, protecting Owner from claims of Liens by such persons);
(iv) Contractor has delivered to Owner an affidavit in a form satisfactory to
Owner stating that the final payment is being requested and that the Lien
releases and/or bonds delivered to Owner include and cover all materials, labor,
and services for which a Lien could be filed against Owner's real property; and
(v) Contractor has delivered to Owner two (2) complete sets of "as-built"
drawings including separate "as-built" drawings for all electrical, plumbing and
mechanical systems included within the Work which drawings shall be executed by
Contractor and all responsible Subcontractors, all guaranties, warranties, shop
manuals, operating binders and maintenance binders applicable to the Work and/or
required by the Specifications. The final payment shall be subject to all
retention provisions of the Contract Documents. Provided all of the foregoing
conditions have been satisfied, except for the completion of minor, corrective
"punch-list" items which do not in any way interfere with Owner's use and
occupancy of the Work, as distinguished from incomplete items, Owner may
withhold from the final payment an amount equal to twice the cost of correction
of all such items until the last of the items has been corrected. If Contractor
fails to make such corrections within thirty (30) days after the final payment,
then Owner may make the corrections and deduct the costs from the amount
withheld therefor.

10.A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. GC PARA l0.4 and 10.5 are deleted. GC PARA l0.3 is
supplemented as follows: Contractor and each Subcontractor (i) shall not cause
or permit any hazardous material to be brought upon the Site or used in the Work
without the prior written consent of Owner, and (ii) shall comply with all Laws
regarding the use, storage, transportation, exposure of employees to, and
disposal of hazardous materials. If the foregoing obligations are breached or if
the presence of a hazardous material on the Site caused or permitted by
Contractor or its Subcontractors or Suppliers results in contamination of the
Site, or if contamination of the Site by hazardous materials for which
Contractor is legally liable to Owner for damage resulting therefrom otherwise
occurs, then Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless from any
and all Claims which arise as a result of the breach of such obligation or such
contamination. The foregoing indemnification of Owner by Contractor includes,
without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any investigation of the
Site or any clean-up, remedial, removal, or restoration work required by any
federal, state or local governmental agency, because of hazardous materials
present in

                                       11

<PAGE>

the soil or groundwater on or under the Site. If Owner knowingly fails to
disclose the presence of hazardous materials on the Site to Contractor or
Architect, then Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless Contractor and its
employees, agents, contractors from all Claims caused by Owner's concealment of
the presence of such hazardous materials, except to the extent that such Claim
is covered by insurance or other sources of reimbursement to the indemnified
party and except to the extent that the Claim results as a consequence of the
negligence or willful misconduct of Contractor or its employees, agents or
contractors. As used in this paragraph, the term "hazardous material" shall mean
any hazardous or toxic substance, material or radioactive material which is or
becomes regulated by any local, federal, governmental authority.

10.B PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY. GC PARA lO.2 is supplemented and
modified as follows: Contractor assumes all risk of loss of, or damage to, its
materials or equipment and the materials and equipment of its Subcontractors,
Suppliers, and employees due to theft or vandalism or malicious mischief and
shall furnish any watchman's services reasonably required to protect the Work.
Until incorporated into the Work, all materials ordered by Contractor or any of
its Subcontractors which are delivered to the Site shall be the responsibility
of Contractor, who shall provide for the care, protection, and security for such
materials, and shall bear the risk of loss with respect to such materials, until
they are incorporated into the Work.

11.A CONTRACTOR'S INSURANCE. GC PARA 11.1 and PARA 11.2 are deleted and replaced
by the following:

11.1 Contractor's Liability Insurance.

Contractor shall at his expense, procure and maintain insurance on all of his
operations, in insurance companies with a Best's Insurance Rating of A- (VII) or
better or otherwise acceptable to Owner, as follows:

(a) Workers' Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance. Workers'
    Compensation insurance shall be provided as required by any applicable law

    $1,000,000 policy limit for bodily injury by disease and $1,000,000 each
    employee for bodily injury by disease.

    If there is an exposure of injury to Contractor's employees under the U.S.
    Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Jones Act or under
    laws, regulations or statutes applicable to maritime employees, coverage
    shall be included for such injuries or claims.

(b) General Liability Insurance. Contractor shall carry Commercial General
    Liability insurance covering all operations by or on behalf of Contractor
    providing insurance for bodily injury liability and property damage
    liability for the limits of liability indicated below for:

       (1)  premises and operations;
       (2)  products and completed operations;
       (3)  contractual liability insuring the obligations assumed by
            Contractor in this Agreement;
       (4)  broad form property damage (including completed operations);
       (5)  explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and
       (6)  personal injury liability (with deletion of the exclusion for
            liability assumed under contract).

       The limits of liability shall not be less than:

         $1,000,000 each occurrence (combined single
            limit for bodily injury and property damage)
         $1,000,000 for personal injury liability $2,000,000 aggregate for
            products completed operations
         $2,000,000 general aggregate

                                       12

<PAGE>

    The "general aggregate" limit shall apply separately to Contractor's work
    under the Contract. Contractor shall not obtain a claims made policy
    without the express prior written consent of Owner.

    Owner, its officers, directors and employees and Landlord shall be named as
    additional insureds. The policy shall be endorsed to stipulate that the
    insurance afforded the additional insureds shall apply as primary insurance
    and that any other insurance maintained by Owner or Landlord shall be
    excess only and shall not be called upon to contribute with this insurance.

    Coverage for Owner, its officers, directors and employees and Landlord as
    additional insureds shall be provided by a policy provision or by an
    endorsement providing coverage at least as broad as Additional Insured
    (Form B) endorsement form CG 2010 as published by the Insurance Services
    Office (ISO).

    Contractor shall continue to maintain liability insurance for the
    products-completed operations hazard for three years following completion
    of and acceptance of the Work by Owner. Contractor shall furnish
    Certificates of Insurance annually to Owner at the beginning of each of
    these subsequent three years as evidence of this required insurance.

    than the following limits in excess of the limits provided by Contractor's
    Commercial General Liability and Auto Liability policies:

    $5,000,000  each occurrence (combined single limit for bodily injury and
                property damage)
    $5,000,000  aggregate for products-completed operations
    $5,000,000  general aggregate

The "general aggregate" limit shall apply separately to Contractor's work under
this Contract.

Contractor's Umbrella Liability or Excess Liability policy and the policy shall
provide that the insurance afforded such additional insureds shall apply as
primary insurance and that any other insurance maintained by Owner will be
excess only and will not contribute with this insurance.

(e) The limits of liability required by this Section 11.1 may be satisfied by a
    combination of limits provided by the primary Commercial General Liability
    and Auto Liability policies plus limits provided by Umbrella or Excess
    Liability policies.

(f) Certificates of Insurance shall be furnished by Contractor to Owner before
    any Work is commenced hereunder by Contractor. The Certificate of Insurance
    shall provide that there will be no cancellation or non-renewal of coverage
    without thirty (30) days prior written notice to Owner.

    The Certificate or Insurance furnished as evidence of Commercial General
    Liability insurance carried by Contractor shall include a copy of the
    policy provision or the additional insured endorsement adding Owner as
    additional insured and providing that such insurance applies as primary
    insurance and will not call upon other insurance maintained by Owner for
    contribution.

(g) If Contractor does not comply with the insurance requirements of this
    paragraph 11.1, Owner may, at his option, provide insurance coverage to
    protect Owner and Contractor and charge Contractor for the cost of that
    insurance. The required insurance shall be subject to the approval of
    Owner, but any

                                       13

<PAGE>

    acceptance of insurance certificates by Owner shall not limit or relieve
    Contractor of the duties and responsibilities assumed by it under this
    Contract.

(h) Subcontractors Insurance. Contractor shall require that each of its
    subcontractors obtain and maintain at all times during the period
    Subcontractor is performing Work for Contractor the insurance described on
    the attached sample insurance certificate.

11.C.1 OWNER'S INSURANCE. GC PARA 11.4.1.2, 11.4.3, 11.4.4, 11.4.6, 11.4.9
(first two sentences only), and 11.4.10 (the words "unless one of..." and
following to end of paragraph only) are deleted. The words "as fiduciary" are
deleted wherever they appear in GC PARA 1.4 and the remainder of GC PARA 11.4 is
supplemented as follows: Owner's insurance (i) shall be placed promptly in the
names of the Owner and at the Owner's option, any other person(s) whom the Owner
deems to have an insurable interest in the Owner's real property and/or the
Work, or any part thereof, and (ii) shall be payable as the respective interests
of said named insureds may appear. The policy shall be retained and held by
Owner and shall not insure against loss, damage, or destruction of any tools,
supplies, equipment or temporary structures located in, on or about the Owner's
real property, which are the property of Contractor, or any Subcontractor,
Supplier, or person directly or indirectly employed by or under contract with
Contractor or its Subcontractors and Suppliers. A copy of any policy (or
certificate thereof) required of Owner by the Contract Documents shall be
delivered to Contractor upon demand.

11.C.2 ADJUSTMENTS UPON DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION. If the Work is damaged or
destroyed prior to the recordation of a Notice of Completion, then, at its
election, Owner may either (a) terminate this Contract in accordance with
Section 2.B.3, or (b) issue a Change Order, complying with Section 7.A,
providing for restoration of the damaged Work, in which case the Guaranteed
Maximum Price and Contract Time shall be appropriately adjusted based on the
extent of such damage and the efforts that will be required to complete the
restoration.

12.A UNCOVERING WORK. GC PARA 12.1 is modified as follows: Contractor shall give
Architect and Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice if
uninspected Work will be covered by other Work. Contractor shall pay for the
cost of uncovering any Work for Architect's inspection if Contractor failed to
give such notice, regardless of whether or not the inspected Work conforms to
the Contract Documents.

12.A.1 After Substantial Completion. GC 12.2.2.1 (the third sentence only) is
deleted.

12.B CORRECTION OF WORK. GC PARA 12.2.4 is supplemented as follows: all Work not
conforming to the Contractor Documents, including without limitation
substitutions not properly approved and authorized shall be considered
defective. In addition to its other rights and remedies at law or in equity or
under the Contract Documents, Owner may correct any non-conforming Work (i)
which Contractor does not undertake to correct within five (5) days following
written notice from Owner or Architect to Contractor of the need for such
correction or which Contractor fails to continue to correct thereafter with due
diligence, or (ii) without notice, in the case of an emergency. Contractor shall
repair any consequential damage to Owner's property caused by any Work furnished
by Contractor, which does not conform to the Specifications or the Contract
Documents.

13.A GOVERNING LAW; INTERPRETATION. GC PARA 13.1.1 is supplemented as follows.
The invalidity of any provision of the Contract Documents (other than the amount
of the Contract Sum) shall not impair or affect in any manner whatsoever the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Contract Documents.

13.B SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. GC PARA 13.2.1 (second and third sentences only)
are deleted. Without Contractor's consent, Owner and any permitted assignee or
successor to Owner hereunder shall have the right to assign the Contract
Documents, or any interest therein, to (i) any lender to Owner, (ii) the owner
of the fee interest in the Project or (iii) any corporation, partnership or
other person which is under common control with Owner or which is controlled by
Owner. At its discretion, but only with Contractor's consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Owner and any permitted assignee
or successor to Owner, shall have the right to assign the Contract Documents, or
any interest therein, to any

                                       14

<PAGE>

other successor owner of the Site. Contractor shall execute an acknowledgment of
any assignment by Owner in a form reasonably requested by Owner. Owner is
relying upon the professional standing and ability of Contractor in the
performance of the Work. Consequently, Contractor shall have no right to assign
the Contract Documents, sublet them as a whole, or assign any monies due or to
become due to Contractor under the Contract Documents, without the prior written
consent of Owner, which consent may be withheld in Owner's sole discretion.

13.C COMMENCEMENT OF STATUTORY LIMITATION PERIOD. GC 13.7.1 is deleted.

14.A TERMINATION BY CONTRACTOR. GC PARA l4.1.1, 14.1.2, and 14.1.3 are deleted.
Contractor may suspend the Work (i) if Owner fails to pay or to object to an
approved Application for Payment for a period of thirty (30) days after notice
of delinquency is received by Owner, (ii) pursuant to an order of any court or
other public authority having jurisdiction, or (iii) as a result of an act of
government, such as a declaration of a national emergency making Materials
unavailable. If the Work is properly suspended for a period of thirty (30) days
or more by Contractor, then Contractor shall also have the right to terminate
the Contract and recover from Owner payment for all Work completed and in place
as of the date of the termination, plus, if the suspension is caused by Owner's
failure to make payments when it was obligated to do so by the Contract
Documents, Contractor also may recover from Owner any amounts recoverable at Law
on account of Owner's breach, including reasonable profit and damages.

14.B DEFAULT BY CONTRACTOR. GC PARA 14.2 and 14.4 are deleted and the following
provision shall apply:

14.B.1 Events of Default. Any of the following events shall be deemed to be a
material default by Contractor under the Contract Documents: (i) failure by
Contractor to prosecute the Work diligently or properly without reasonable
cause; or (ii) failure by Contractor to make prompt payment of amounts due to
any Subcontractor or other Supplier of Material or labor to the Work; or (iii)
failure by Contractor to comply with any applicable Law; or (iv) failure by
Contractor to perform any other obligation or to comply with any term, provision
or condition of the Contract Documents for a period of ten (10) days following
receipt of written notice of such default from Owner; or (v) commencement and
continuation for at least thirty (30) days of any case, action, or proceeding
by, against, or concerning Contractor under any federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, or other debtor's relief law, or concerning a financial
reorganization and arrangement with any of Contractor's creditors; or (vi)
voluntary or involuntary appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other person,
which takes possession for more than thirty (30) days of substantially all of
Contractor's assets or of any asset used in connection with the Work, regardless
of whether such appointment is a result of insolvency or any other cause; or
(vii) execution by Contractor of an assignment for the benefit of its creditors
covering any asset used in connection with the Work or substantially all of
Contractor's assets available by law for the satisfaction of judgments; or
(viii) levy of a writ of attachment or execution on any of Contractor's
equipment, tools, machinery, or its interest in the Contract Documents, if such
writ continues for a period of ten (10) days; or (ix) a default by Contractor
under any other contract between Contractor and Owner; or (x) repeated failure
by Contractor to perform its obligations under the Contract Documents in a
timely or satisfactory fashion, which materially interferes with Owner's
schedule for completion of the Work.

14.B.2 Owner's Remedies on Account of Contractor's Default. Upon the occurrence
of an event of material default by Contractor, at Owner's sole election, Owner
shall have the right to pursue any and all remedies it may have at law or in
equity, including (i) the right to keep the Contract in effect and sue
Contractor for all damages caused by the default, (ii) the right to cure any
such default and recover the cost thereof from Contractor along with any damages
caused thereby, and/or (iii) the right to terminate this Contract, in whole or
in part. If Owner elects to terminate this Contract, it shall have the right to
pursue any or all of the following: (i) Owner may engage others to complete
Contractor's performance at Contractor's expense; (ii) Owner may recover from
Contractor upon demand payment of the difference between the unpaid balance of
the Contract Sum and the estimated reasonable value of the cost to complete
Contractor's performance; (iii) following completion of the Work, Owner may
recover from Contractor the difference between the unpaid balance of the
Contract Sum and all costs and expenses incurred by Owner to complete the Work
(including interest on Owner's expenditures from the date the costs and expenses

                                       15

<PAGE>

incurred by Owner exceed the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum until repayment
by Contractor, at the interest rate described in GC PARA 13.6.1; and (iv) Owner
may recover from Contractor all damages, costs, expenses, attorneys' fees,
experts' fees, court costs, and lost profits, of any kind and nature, directly
or indirectly related to the default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Contractor fails to perform its obligations under the Contract Documents or if a
material event of default as defined above should otherwise create an emergency
effecting the safety of persons or property, then without the need for any
notice or the allowance of any cure period whatsoever, Owner may take such
action as it in good faith deems appropriate to eliminate the risk of harm, and
upon demand Contractor shall reimburse Owner for the costs and expenses so
incurred by Owner with interest thereon at the interest rate stipulated in the
Contract Documents for past due payments from the date of the expenditure until
repaid..

14.B.3 Owner's Election to Terminate. In addition to Owner's right to terminate
on account of Contractor's default, Owner may terminate the Contract and the
Work, in whole or in part, by written notice to Contractor at any time, for any
reason or no reason. If Owner so elects to terminate the Contract, and
Contractor is not then in default under the Contract, Owner shall pay to
Contractor the unpaid Cost of the Work, earned, due and payable to Contractor as
of the termination date with respect to the Work that has been completed and the
Contractor's Fee shall be equitably reduced to reflect the amount of Work that
will not be performed. Contractor hereby waives all claims for damages and loss
of anticipated profits on account of Owner's termination of the Contract (other
than Contractor's right to an adjusted Contractor's Fee as described above);
and, as the sole right or remedy of Contractor on account of such termination,
Contractor shall receive the amounts payable to Contractor under the Contract.

14.B.4 Contractor's Obligations Upon Any Termination. Upon receipt of any
termination notice under the Contract Documents (whether due to Contractor's
default or otherwise), unless the notice directs otherwise, Contractor shall (i)
immediately discontinue the Work and, to the extent specified in the notice,
place no further orders or subcontracts for Materials or labor (except as may be
necessary for completion of such portions of the Work as are not discontinued);
(ii) promptly make every reasonable effort to procure cancellation, upon terms
satisfactory to Owner, of all orders and subcontracts to the extent they relate
to the performance of the discontinued portion of the Work; and (iii) thereafter
do only such Work as may be necessary to preserve and protect Work already in
progress and to protect materials on the Site or in transit thereto. Upon
partial termination of the Work, the obligations of Contractor shall continue as
to the portions of the Work performed and the obligations assumed by Contractor
prior to the date of termination.

14.B.5 Contractor's Obligations Following Termination Based on Contractor's
Default. If Owner terminates this Contract on account of Contractor's default,
in addition to its obligations under Section 14.B.4 above, Contractor shall
promptly and peaceably vacate the Site and at Owner's election, Owner may, (i)
take possession of the Site and of all Materials, equipment, tools, construction
equipment and machinery thereon owned by Contractor and Owner may finish the
Work by whatever method it may deem expedient, or (ii) cease construction and
require Contractor to promptly remove from the Site at Contractor's expense all
Materials, equipment, tools, and construction equipment owned by Contractor.
Owner shall pay to Contractor fair compensation (at the election of Owner either
by purchase at fair market value or by rental at the prevailing rate of the
locale) for any equipment owned by Contractor and used by Owner during the
completion of the Work. Upon demand, (i) Contractor shall assign and deliver to
Owner all drawings, specifications, subcontracts, documents, tangible and
intangible property, and contractual rights as Owner may demand for the purpose
of completing the Work, and (ii) Contractor shall execute and deliver to Owner
such written documentation as Owner may request for the purpose of evidencing
the vesting in Owner of the rights and benefits of Contractor with respect to
the documents and rights so delivered and assigned.

14.B.6 Further Payments to Contractor. If Owner terminates the Contract as
provided in the Contract Documents on account of Contractor's default and elects
to complete the Work, Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further
payments under this Contract until said Work is fully completed. Upon completion
of the Work, if the expenses reasonably incurred by Owner in completing the Work
(including, without limitation, payments made by Owner to any party supplying
labor, Materials, equipment, services and the like for the Work and cost
incurred by Owner for managerial, administrative, or supervisorial services)
plus the amounts previously paid by Owner to Contractor exceeds the Contract
Sum, Contractor

                                       16

<PAGE>

shall pay Owner upon demand the amount of such excess, plus interest thereon at
the rate specified in GC PARA 13.6.1. In all other cases of termination for
Contractor's default, Owner's liability to Contractor shall be limited to
reimbursement to Contractor of the unpaid Contract Sum earned, due and payable
to Contractor as of the date of the termination, less (i) any amounts owing to
Owner by Contractor under the terms of the Contract Documents, and (ii) all
costs, expenses, damages, attorneys' fees, experts' fees, court costs, and lost
profits incurred by Owner as a consequence of Contractor's default.

15.A MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. GC PARA 15.1 and 15.2 are deleted.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Addendum
intending to be bound thereby.

I.      INTRODUCTION

To our Tenants at ELLIOTT PARK NORTH:

Welcome! This Tenant Construction Manual (TCM) provides the Tenant an outline
for establishing the general rules, guidelines and conditions of work within and
about the Premises. The Tenant must also provide a current copy of this manual
to their Contractors, Architect, Engineer(s) and Designers prior to any
improvements or alterations.

In the instance that this TCM is an exhibit to the Lease, the Lease will take
precedence if there are conflicts between these documents.

The general rules and conditions in this manual are to be used as a guideline
and may be subject to change at the discretion of the Landlord. Additional
copies of this TCM may be obtained from the Construction Coordination Manager at
a cost of $25.00 each. Prior to construction, it is the Tenant's responsibility
to ensure that this TCM is the most current TCM at the time of construction. An
updated copy of the TCM may be requested from the Landlord's Representative at
no charge.

The Construction Coordination Manager is the Landlord's Representative and
contact regarding Landlord's design requirements, submittals, and construction
issues.

The Tenant, at least fourteen (14) days prior to construction commencement, must
provide Landlord with Submittal Documents, per section III of this TCM, for
approval.

The following contacts are provided to assist with the construction phase:

II.     DESIGN CRITERIA
        A.      DRAWINGS
                Prior to design, Tenant shall request the Landlord's most
                current CADD Master Background Compact Disk (CD) for the
                Premises. Tenant's design shall be incorporated into this Master
                Background. This Master Background shall also be used for
                as-builts of existing and constructed conditions, as required
                per Section VIII-Tenant's Construction Drawings/As-Builts. A
                copy of the as-builts in the CADD format (as originally received
                in the Landlord's Master Background) shall be returned to
                Landlord at project completion.

        B.      SALVAGE
                Landlord reserves the right to salvage removed equipment and
                materials not previously designated and approved for use in the
                new construction. Tenant's Contractor is to coordinate with
                Landlord for a 'Salvage Walk-Thru' to designate materials to be
                salvaged. Salvageable materials may include but are not limited
                to: casework, carpet, doors, relites, frames, power panels and
                switch gear, light fixtures and HVAC equipment, grilles and
                registers. These materials and/or equipment will be removed by
                Tenant's Contractor in such a manner as to avoid damage or loss
                of parts or components, and will be moved to a location as
                directed by Landlord's Representative. All material not salvaged
                or reused is to be removed and disposed of off-site in a lawful
                manner by Tenant's Contractor.

        C.      SIGNAGE
                Tenant/Tenant's Contractor must submit for Landlord's approval
                all sign posting plans prior to placement of signs in or about
                the property. Some posting examples include:
                    .  Contractors Company Name/Job Sign
                    .  Reserved Parking
                    .  Restricted Area
                    .  No Smoking

        D.      SCREEN WALLS
                Tenant/Tenant's Contractor must obtain Landlord's approval for

                work. It is the Tenant's responsibility to verify that building
                systems are adequate to sustain their design. Approval by
                Landlord's Representative does not amend the Lease nor does it
                warrant that the design is sustainable by the building. All
                aspects of the improvements/work shall be submitted for Landlord
                approval.

                The Landlord's Representative must review and approve Final

                sent to the Landlord's Representative, Attention: Construction
                Coordination Manager. All reviews are at Tenant's expense. A

                a.      Tenant shall submit two (2) sets of complete
                        Construction Drawing and Specification Documents for

                                shall not alleviate Tenant's responsibility to

                                Tenant's plans comply with any ordinances,
                                codes, laws, rules or regulations applicable to
                                Tenant's permitted uses; nor does such approval
                                connote any professional assessment of the
                                quality, durability or safety of Tenant's design
                                or of the materials to be used in construction
                                of Tenant's leasehold improvements.
                        3.      Tenant shall coordinate all fire protection

                        additional or corrected information required by Landlord
                        within twenty (20) days after Landlord's initial
                        response, for Landlord's re-review. Allow fourteen (14)
                        days for re-submittal review.
                f.      It is highly recommended, though not required, that

                drawings for all scopes of work and specification for all
                installed materials and equipment, etc. If the Submittal package

                proceed on partial approved Documents in writing. All reviews
                are at Tenant's expense. Incomplete submittals require more

                Tenant's Contractor must provide Landlord with a subcontractor
                list with twenty-four (24)-hour emergency phone numbers and
                contact names prior to or at the pre-construction meeting.
                Landlord reserves the right to reasonably disapprove any or all
                subcontractors and suppliers.

        E.      PRE-CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION
                Tenant's Contractor must arrange a pre-construction inspection
                with Landlord to determine existing damage in common areas, and
                review options for material travel routes to and from Tenant's
                Premises. Landlord will document results and provide Tenant's
                Contractor with a pre-construction inspection report before
                construction starts.

        F.      SPACE ACCEPTANCE
                By occupying the designated space for construction, Tenant shall
                be deemed to have accepted the Premises "AS-IS", unless
                otherwise notified by Landlord in writing at the time of the
                pre-construction meeting. By occupying the Premises for
                construction, the Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has
                completed the work required of it pursuant to the Lease and has
                agreed that Landlord is not then in default in any of its

                It is agreed and understood that the utilities servicing the
                Premises may need to be separately metered as per the terms of
                the Lease. In the event the utilities are not separately metered
                and the cost of utilities, per the Lease, are to be a direct
                cost of Tenant's, an estimated per day charge will be assessed
                by the Landlord to Tenant during the build-out and construction
                phase or until such time as a permanent metering device is
                installed and transferred into Tenant's name. Furthermore, if
                Tenant has received Landlord's permission to occupy the Premises
                early to perform construction activity, an estimate for
                utilities may be assessed on a per day basis during this early
                occupancy period.

VI.     CONSTRUCTION
        A.      STOP WORK
                In the event Tenant's Contractor violates Landlord, city, state
                or federal standards or becomes involved in a labor dispute,
                Landlord, at its sole discretion, may order Contractor or
                sub-contractor to cease work immediately and to remove itself
                and its equipment from Landlord's properties within twenty-four
                (24) hours of its receipt of written notice from the Landlord.

        B.      CONSTRUCTION OBSERVATION
                Landlord reserves the right at any time to review Tenant's
                Contractor's construction status. Should Landlord observe a
                nonconformity to approved plans and specifications or provisions
                outlined in this Document, Landlord may request that
                construction be halt until the question of nonconformity has
                been resolved.

        C.      SUPERVISION
                Tenant's Contractor must provide a qualified on-site supervisor
                during all work activities.

                shall be at Landlord's discretion and may require long-term
                planning. Shutdown set up and recharging costs shall be at
                Tenant's expense. Costs associated with life safety system
                shutdowns and recharging, at a cost per occurrence, shall also

        F.      FIRE PROTECTION
                The sprinkler system should be installed as soon as possible and
                be in service before introducing significant amounts of
                combustibles in the Premises. Tenant's Contractor shall use
                blanks or plugs as needed to keep at least part of the sprinkler
                system in service overnight.

                If fire protection is not in service, as soon as the hydrants
                are ready, provide hoses that can cover most of the area. If
                hoses cannot be provided, then adequate fire extinguishers shall
                be provided in the area. In addition, at any time and for any
                reason that the sprinklers are not in service, Tenant, at

                non-working hours.

        G.      CONSTRUCTION MEETINGS
                Landlord reserves the right to attend any or all Tenant/Tenant's
                Contractor construction meetings. Landlord may request copies of
                the Tenant Contractor's construction minutes pertaining to
                Landlord's properties.

        H.      CONFLICTS
                Where conflicts exist between building codes, utilities'
                requirements, statutes, ordinances, regulatory requirements, and
                Landlord's requirements, the more stringent shall govern.

        I.      MATERIALS
                1.      Tenant shall use only new, first-class materials in
                        completing its work. All work and equipment shall be

                        project/improvement completion. Such warranties shall
                        not relieve Tenant from its maintenance obligations as
                        provided for in the executed Lease Documents.

                during normal business hours (7am to 6pm weekdays). If
                available, a freight elevator may be designated upon request for
                construction use. Tenant/Tenant's Contractor will be responsible
                for protecting the elevator cab finishes as required by
                Landlord. Service keys and wall pads may be available upon
                request. Tenant's Contractor must request Landlord approval of
                expected large deliveries twenty-four (24) hours in advance. Use
                of all Landlord conveyances, such as elevators or stairwells for
                material or personal use must have prior approval. Landlord's
                entries, common area corridors, stairwells, service accesses,
                loading docks, and exit pathways must remain completely open and
                serviceable at all times.

        C.      FLOOR AND WALL PROTECTION
                Tenant's Contractor must provide floor and wall protection to
                insure finishes are protected during construction activities and
                to prevent material deliveries from adversely affecting the
                floor finish. Tenant's Contractor will be liable for resulting
                floor or wall damage.

        D.      DAILY CLEANING
                Once construction begins in Tenant's Premises, cleaning of the
                area becomes the responsibility of Tenant and its Contractor.
                Work areas and travel areas (inside and out) must be maintained
                in a clean condition at all times.
                1.      Tenant's Contractors must supply and install a large
                        carpeted walk-off mat inside the entrance of the work
                        Premises to eliminate the tracking of dust and debris
                        into the Building common area(s).
                2.      Trash must be placed in containers and removed by
                        Tenant's Contractor to Contractor's dumpster on a daily
                        basis. Reference VII - Section A.
                3.      Failure to comply will result in a deduction to the
                        construction damage deposit or to Tenant's Contractor
                        for Landlord's clean-up and administration fees.

        E.      CONSTRUCTION PRE-FILTERS
                Prior to commencement of any construction activity, Tenant's
                Contractor will install and maintain construction pre-filters in
                the Building's return air system servicing the construction area
                and/or floor. When construction is complete, the pre-filters
                shall be removed and disposed of properly off-site by Tenant's
                Contractor.

        F.      DUST BARRIERS
                If construction dust becomes excessive, temporary dust barriers
                at demising walls in plenum spaces may be required. If requested
                by Landlord, Tenant's Contractor must install dust barriers at
                Tenant's expense. Certain detection devices are highly sensitive
                to dust particles, which can cause them to go into alarm. If any
                such devices are in or adjacent to Tenant's Premises, please
                consult Landlord's Representative for procedures.

        H.      EQUIPMENT UPKEEP
                Landlord reserves the right to shutdown or remove any of
                Tenant's Contractor equipment showing signs of disrepair or
                neglect if the equipment is deemed hazardous to either life
                safety or environment.

        I.      SPOILS
                Tenant's Contractor shall not store spoils on the site for more
                than seven (7) days. Spoils that require testing must be removed
                within twenty-four (24) hours of a positive contamination test
                result. Stored spoils must remain covered and adequately
                barricaded.

        J.      WASH OUT AREA
                Tenant's Contractor will not allow any disposal on the Premises
                of wastewater, concrete, mortar, gypcrete or similar products
                that may in any way violate City, State or Federal environmental
                laws. All disposals shall comply with current regulations.

                Tenant or Tenant's Contractor is responsible for obtaining all
                required inspections by governing agencies. Tenant's Contractor
                is responsible for correcting all deficiencies recorded by the
                inspectors.
        B.      CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY

<PAGE>

        Tenant's Contractor shall notify Landlord's Representative in writing
        within five (5) days of when work is substantially complete, and request
        a final inspection from Landlord. Landlord shall provide Tenant's
        Contractor with a written punch list, which will describe any identified
        construction deficiencies pursuant to the Approved Plans. Any punch list
        items not completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the
        punchlist was presented to Tenant may, at Landlord's option, be
        completed at Tenant's expense.

XI.     LANDLORD'S FINAL ACCEPTANCE
        In order for Tenant to receive Landlord's Final Acceptance, Tenant must,
        within thirty (30) days of the date Tenant opens for business, obtain
        and present to Landlord the following items:
        A.      A copy of the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) issued by the
                Building Department or documentation of when C of O will be
                issued. (Food Service Tenants must also include documented
                approvals from the local Health Department prior to opening.)
        B.      Copies of all Building Permits and other required permits,
                indicating inspections and approvals by the appropriate agency.
        C.      As-built drawings of Tenant's Work (per Section VIII) in hard
                copy and electronic CADD file.
        D.      HVAC Balance Reports by an independent air balance contractor.
        E.      The completed punchlist initialed by Landlord's Representative.
        F.      Tenant's Contractor shall repair all damage to the Building
                created by its own work.
        G.      O & M manuals and warranties for all Tenant Work including
                installed equipment and roof top penetrations.
        H.      Contractor Certification of Asbestos Free Product Installation.
        I.      Upon completion, general contractor shall supply Landlord with
                Final Lien Release (page 23) AND with the Sworn Statement and
                Indemnity (page 22) from all Contractors, Subtiers, Suppliers,
                Laborers, Material Suppliers, etc., who contracted directly with
                the Tenant.

XII.    GOOD FAITH INSPECTION FOR ASBESTOS
        Tenant and Tenant's Contractors must have Landlord's good faith
        Inspection report on the Premises prior to starting work. The Washington
        Industrial Safety Health Act 296-62-07707 states that before allowing or
        authorizing any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance,
        repair or demolition, Landlord shall perform a good faith inspection to
        determine whether materials to be worked on or removed contain asbestos.

        The possession of the Landlord's good faith Inspection report does not
        indicate the exact location of all asbestos containing materials (ACM's)
        in the building, especially in the case of older buildings, nor does the
        Landlord make representation that all ACM locations in the building are
        known. Tenant / Tenant's Contractor(s) should proceed with caution and
        use safe and prudent methods and abide by all laws concerning the use,
        handling, abatement, transportation, discharge and storage of hazardous
        materials.

        It is the responsibility of Tenant's Contractor to request and obtain a
        copy of this report and display it in the Premises in full view of all
        persons entering the work site. Tenant's Contractor is also responsible
        to disclose to Landlord's Representatives its discovery of any material
        that may contain asbestos or other hazardous materials not mentioned in
        the good faith inspection. If any ACM's are suspected, immediately stop
        work, and do not disturb or remove the suspect material until Landlord
        has performed tests and/or abatement.

Mr. David Sabey
102 Elliott Avenue West, Suite 330

PROJECT: 9203 CELL THERAPEUTICS, INC. LABORATORY

SUBJECT: HEATING SYSTEM DESIGN AND OPERATION

Dear Mr. Sabey:

This letter summarizes the basis of design and operation for the heating system,
including responsibilities of both CTI and David Sabey ("Sabey", building
owner).

1.   Existing Boiler No. 2 (west) will be dedicated to the present and future
     CTI loads. Existing Boiler No. 1 (east) will be dedicated to Sabey loads.
     This is based upon the heating load calculations for CTI, and statements
     made by Sabey personnel that only one of the two existing boilers is
     necessary to handle the entire existing (non-CTI) heating load during the
     coldest weather.

2.   CTI Boiler No. 2 will serve the Elliott Park Building present and planned
     CTI heating loads (new 4th Floor laboratories and administrative offices,
     and planned partial 3rd Floor and total 5th Floor laboratories and
     administrative offices).

3.   Sabey Boiler No. 1 will serve the Elliott Park Building non-CTI heating
     loads and the PI Building heating loads.

4.   CTI will assume responsibility for Boiler No. 2 for CTI's exclusive use
     including maintenance and operation.

5.   Boiler No. 2 will operate independently from Boiler No. 1, and will serve
     CTI loads on a 24 hour per day, 7 day per week basis.

6.   Sabey will be responsible for Boiler No. 1 including maintenance and
     operation.

7.   The two boilers will normally be isolated from each other. A
     normally-closed manual shutoff valve will be provided by CTI to allow both
     CTI and Sabey loads to be served by either boiler, to provide "partial"
     capacity backup if one of the boilers fails, or if gas service is
     interrupted due to the status of the building being on interruptible gas
     service. (Boiler No. 2 has a dual fuel burner and oil fuel backup
     capability).

8.   Boiler No. 2 will be connected by CTI to a new CTI steam-to-water heat
     exchanger (converter) and a hot water heating system.

9.   The natural gas supply is common to both boilers. A BTU meter will be
     installed by CTI in the hot water heating piping from the converter, with
     readout in the DDC control system. A conversion factor will be applied to
     the BTU meter readings to account for boiler efficiency and natural gas
     heat capacity, resulting in CTI natural gas usage for billing purposes. CTI
     will reimburse Sabey for CTI's gas energy usage. If required, CTI will
     establish a separate gas line to boiler #2 when the fifth floor expansion
     is accomplished.

10.  A complete boiler inspection of boiler #2 will be done and necessary
     repairs completed by CTI to minimize the possibility of an unscheduled
     shut-down and associated negative effect upon critical operations. All
     manhole, handhole, and door gaskets will be replaced in conjunction with
     the inspection.

11.  The original 150-to-15 psig pressure reducing valve (PRV) has been removed.
     A new PRV is not included in this project since the boilers are not planned
     to be operated at high pressure. The new CTI steam converter includes a new
     temperature control value sized to provide control at 15 psig inlet
     pressure. New piping components are rated for operation at 150 psig as a
     precaution. Caution regarding this issue needs to be taken, since operation
     at the 150 psig pressure rating of the boilers poses an extreme danger in
     the existing installation.

12.  The following maintenance items identified in a boiler inspection by
     Midriff Energy Products (commissioned by McKinstry) will be accomplished by
     CTI to minimize the possibility of unscheduled shut-downs:

     a.   On boiler #2, the 2nd gas valve operator has been leaking oil and will
          be replaced.

     b.   On boiler #2, the header valve needs to be replaced or removed and
          sent out for rebuild. It has been leaking.

13.  The high fire rate on each boiler has been decreased from approximately
     5,000,000 BTUH input to approximately 3,000,000 BTUH input. The sizes of
     the flue and chimney are adequate for 3,900,000 BTUH each boiler (7,800,000
     BTUH total both boilers). CTI's ultimate load will be approximately
     2,350,000 BTUH, which is below the current capacity of Boiler No. 2.

14.  The existing boilers and their controls will remain as is. New CTI controls
     will be provided for the converter and hot water heating system.

15.  The feed water and chemical treatment system will remain common to both
     boilers. Maintenance costs will be shared equally by CTI and Sabey.

16.  The new hot water heating pumps serving CTI heating loads will be connected
     to CTI's electrical service by CTI.

17.  The cost of maintenance and operation of the oil back up system for boiler
     #2 will be shared equally between CTI and Sabey as heat would be provided
     from boiler #2 to both CTI and Sabey in the event of interrupted gas
     service. It is agreed and understood that adjustments to heating loads will
     have to be made by both CTI and Sabey to accommodate heating needs of both
     buildings in the event of an emergency.

18.  CTI and Sabey will split equally the cost of maintaining the boiler room to
     the extent such costs are attributable to the Elliott Park Building except
     for costs which may be incurred to comply with city code requirements. The
     code related costs will be paid by Sabey unless work done by CTI creates
     the problem, in which case CTI will pay.

A copy of CTI Drawing M13. Heating System Modifications, dated 20 October 1992,
which delineates the work and contains the control sequence was presented to you
on 20 October 1992. Additional copies of the drawing will be available upon
request.

Sincerely,
