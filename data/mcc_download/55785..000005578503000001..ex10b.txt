                                                               Exhibit No. (10)b
                           KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION
                            EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
                                       As
                              Amended and Restated
                             As of November 12, 2002


              1.     Preamble and Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Plan
is to assure the  Corporation  that it will have the continued  dedication of,
and the availability of objective advice and counsel from, key executives of the
Corporation notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a change of
control of the Corporation.

         In the event the Corporation receives any proposal from a third person
concerning a possible business combination with the Corporation, or acquisition
of the Corporation's equity securities, or otherwise considers or pursues a
transaction that could lead to a change of control, the Board of Directors of
the Corporation (the "Board") believes it imperative that the Corporation and
the Board be able to rely upon key executives to continue in their positions and
be available for advice, if requested, without concern that those individuals
might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a
possibility.

         Should the Corporation receive or consider any such proposal or
transaction, in addition to their regular duties, such key executives may be
called upon to assist in the assessment of the proposal or transaction, to
advise management and the Board as to whether the proposal or transaction would
be in the best interest of the Corporation and its stockholders, and to take
such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.

              2.     Definitions.  As used in this Plan, the following  terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

                     (a)    Agreements: Executive Severance Agreements in

              Target-level award payable to the Participant for the year in
              which the Relevant Date occurred (or, if not then established, for
              the preceding year) or, if

                            or

                     (iii) the refusal or failure by the Participant to
                           act in accordance with any lawful directive
                           or order of the Corporation, or an act or
                           failure to act by the Participant which is
                           in bad faith and which is detrimental to the

              the persons who were  directors of the  Corporation  before the
              Transaction  shall cease to  constitute  a majority of the Board

                           attributable

<PAGE>

                           to the fact that the Corporation is no longer a

                           of Control or another location within 50 miles from
                           that location; (B) the location of the headquarters
                           of the Corporation; or (C) the location of the
                           headquarters of one of its centers of operation;
                           provided, that required travel on the Corporation's
                           business to an extent substantially consistent with
                           the Participant's business travel obligations as of
                           the date of the Change of Control shall not be
                           considered Good Reason;

                   (iv)    the failure of the Corporation to pay as soon as
                           administratively feasible, after notice from the
                           Participant, any portion of the Participant's current
                           compensation;

                   (v)     the failure of the Corporation to continue in effect
                           any compensation plan in which the Participant
                           participates immediately prior to the Change of
                           Control which is material to the Participant's total
                           compensation, including but not limited to the
                           Corporation's stock option, incentive compensation,
                           and bonus plans, or any substitute plans adopted
                           prior to the Change of Control, unless an equitable
                           arrangement (which is embodied in an ongoing
                           substitute or alternative plan but which n eed not
                           provide the Participant with equity-based incentives)
                           has been made with respect to such plan, or the
                           failure by the Corporation to continue the
                           Participant's participation therein (or in such

<PAGE>

                           substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not
                           materially less favorable than the benefits provided
                           to other participants;

                   (vi)    the failure by the Corporation to continue to provide
                           the Participant with benefits substantially similar
                           to those enjoyed by the Participant under any of the
                           Corporation's pension, life insurance, medical,
                           health and accident, or disability plans in which the
                           Participant was participating at the time of the
                           Change of Control, the taking of any action by the
                           Corporation which would directly or indirectly
                           materially reduce any of such benefits or deprive the
                           Participant of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by
                           the Participant at the time of the Change of Control,
                           or the failure by the Corporation to provide the
                           Participant with the number of paid vacation days to
                           which the Participant is entitled on the basis of
                           years of service with the Corporation in accordance
                           with the Corporation's normal vacation policy in
                           effect at the time of the Change of Control.

                     The  Participant's  right to terminate  the  Participant's
              employment  for Good Reason  shall  not be  affected  by  the
              Participant's  incapacity  due to physical or mental illness.
              However, in order to terminate  employment for Good Reason, (1)
              the Participant must give the Corporation a notice setting forth
              the circumstances of the act or failure to act alleged to
              constitute Good Reason within 30 days after the Participant first
              has actual notice of such act or failure,  and stating that the
              Participant has determined that such  act  or  failure
              constitutes  "Good  Reason"  hereunder,   (2)  the Corporation
              must fail to correct such act or failure  within 30 days after
              it receives such notice from the Participant,  and (3) the
              Participant must actually  terminate  his or her  employment
              during  the  period of 30 days beginning 30 days after the
              Corporation receives such notice.

                   (m)     Multiplier:  For a Tier I Participant, three; and for
              a Tier II Participant, two.

                   (n)     Net After Tax Receipt: The Value of a Payment, net of
              all taxes imposed on a Tier II Participant with respect thereto
              under Sections

<PAGE>

              1 and 4999 of the Code, determined by applying
              the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which
              applied to the Tier II Participant's taxable income for the
              immediately preceding taxable year.

                   (o)     Parachute Value: With respect to a Payment, the
              present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes
              of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that
              constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as
              determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining
              whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such
              Payment.

                   (p)     Participant: An Eligible Executive who is a party to
              an Agreement which has not been terminated in accordance with the
              terms of this Plan.

                   (q)     Payment: Any payment or distribution in the nature of
              compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
              Code) to or for the benefit of a Participant, whether paid or
              payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise.

                   (r)     Qualified Termination of Employment:  The termination
              of a Participant's employment with the Corporation and/or its
              Subsidiaries either (i) within the two(2) year period following a
              Change of Control of the Corporation (A) by the Corporation
              without Cause, (B) by the Participant with Good Reason or (C) in
              the case of a Tier I Participant only, by the Participant for any
              reason during the period of 30 days beginning on the first
              anniversary of the date of the Change of Control, or (ii) by the
              Corporation without Cause before a Change of Control, if a Change
              of Control occurs within one year after such termination and it is
              reasonably demonstrated by the Participant that such termination
              of employment was at the request of a third party that had taken
              steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or
              otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change
              of Control.  A transfer of employment for administrative purposes
              among the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed a
              Qualified Termination of Employment, but if such a transfer
              results in the occurrence of Good Reason, the affected Participant
              shall

<PAGE>

              have the right to terminate employment for Good Reason and
              such termination shall be a Qualified Termination of Employment.

                   (s)     Reduced Amount: With respect to a Participant, the
              greatest aggregate amount of Separation Payments which (a) is less
              than the sum of all Separation Payments and (b) results in
              aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are equal to or greater
              than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result if the
              Participant were paid the sum of all Separation Payments.

                   (t)     Relevant Date: In the case of a Qualified Termination
              of Employment as described in clause (ii) of the definition of
              "Qualified Termination of Employment," the date of such
              Qualified Termination of Employment and, in all other cases, the
              date of the Change of Control.

              Payment paid or payable to the Participant pursuant to this Plan
              or an Agreement (disregarding Section 9 of this Plan).

                   (v)     Severance Period: For a Tier I Participant, the
              period of three years beginning on the date of the Qualified
              Termination of Employment; and for a Tier II Participant, the
              period of two years beginning on the date of the Qualified
              Termination of Employment.

                   (w)     Subsidiary: Any domestic or foreign corporation at
              least twenty percent (20%) of whose shares normally entitled to
              vote in electing directors is owned directly or indirectly by the
              Corporation or by other Subsidiaries.

                   (x)     Tier I Participant:  A Participant whose Agreement
              indicates that he or she is a Tier I Participant.

                   (y)     Tier II Participant:  A Participant whose Agreement
              indicates that he or she is a Tier II Participant.

                   (z)     Value: With respect to a Payment, the economic
              present value of a Payment as of the date of the change of control
              for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, as determined by the
              Accounting Firm using the discount rate required by Section
              280G(d)(4) of the Code.

              3.     Participation; Agreements. Eligible Executives shall be
proffered  an Agreement  and upon  execution  and  delivery  thereof by the
Eligible  Executive  evidencing  such  Eligible  Executive's  agreement  not  to
voluntarily  leave the employ of the  Corporation  and its  Subsidiaries  and to
continue to render  services  during the  pendency of any  threatened  Change of
Control of the Corporation,  such Eligible Executive shall become a Participant.
Each Agreement  shall indicate  whether the  Participant to whom it is proffered
will be a Tier I Participant or a Tier II Participant. A Participant shall cease
to be a  Participant  in the Plan  upon  the  termination  of the  Participant's
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

              4.     Termination of Employment of Participants. Nothing in this
Plan shall be deemed to entitle a Participant to continued  employment with
the  Corporation  and its  Subsidiaries  and the  rights of the  Corporation  to
terminate the employment of a Participant shall continue as fully as though this
Plan were not in effect,  provided that any Qualified  Termination of Employment
shall entitle the  Participant  to the benefits  herein  provided.  In addition,
nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to entitle a Participant under this Plan to
any rights,  or to payments  under this Plan,  with respect to any plan in which
the  Participant  was not a  participant  prior to a  Qualified  Termination  of
Employment.

              5.     Payments Upon Qualified Termination of Employment. In the
event of a Qualified Termination of Employment of a Participant, a lump sum
cash payment or payments shall be made to such  Participant as compensation  for
services rendered, in an amount or amounts (subject to any applicable payroll or
other taxes required to be withheld)  equal to the sum of the amounts  specified
in  subsections  (a) through (i) below,  such payments to be made within 10 days
following  the last day of employment of the  Participant  with the  Corporation
except to the extent not yet  calculable,  in which case such portions  shall be
paid as soon as practicable following the ability to calculate the amount:

                           (a) Salary Plus Incentive Compensation. A lump sum
                  amount equal to the Multiplier times the sum of (a) the
                  Participant's annual base salary at the rate in effect
                  immediately prior to the Relevant Date or, if higher,
                  immediately before the Qualified Termination of Employment and
                  (b) the Annual Bonus Amount;

                  A lump sum amount equal to the payment to which the
                  Participant would have been entitled had all Participation
                  Shares awarded to the Participant under any Equity Plan that
                  were outstanding on the Relevant Date and which had not
                  matured as of the date of termination of employment and which
                  will not mature as a result of the termination of employment,
                  matured, such payment to be determined as though such award
                  had matured and its book value at maturity been determined on
                  the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the date of
                  termination of the Participant's employment;

                           (c) Equity Participation Plan - Option Shares (i)

                  the effective date of the Participant's Agreement for which
                  the Option Price is lower than the Fair Market Value of the
                  Stock at such date, all stock options that were granted to the
                  Participant under any of the Equity Plans, including but not
                  limited to any substitute plans adopted prior to the Relevant
                  Date (or any successor or additional plan), that were
                  outstanding both on the Relevant Date and immediately before
                  the Qualified Termination of Employment, shall vest and become
                  exercisable and the Qualified Termination of Employment of the
                  Participant shall be deemed a retirement for purposes of
                  exercising the stock options under the terms of the Equity
                  Plans, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
                  Incentive Stock Options that were outstanding at the effective
                  date of the Participant's Agreement for which the Option Price
                  is lower than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at such date,

                  termination of the shares of common stock of the Corporation
                  or other equity security then subject to such Incentive Stock
                  Options over (II) the aggregate option price for such shares
                  or other equity security;

                           (d) Restricted Stock. With respect to restricted
                  stock granted to the Participant under any of the Equity Plans
                  that were outstanding but not vested on the Relevant Date and
                  which are forfeited as a result of the termination of the
                  Participant's employment, a lump sum amount equal to

<PAGE>

                  the Fair Market Value of an equivalent number of shares of
                  common stock of the Corporation (or such other equity security
                  into which the restricted stock has been converted) on the
                  date of termination of employment;

                           (e) Successor or Additional Stock Appreciation Right,
                  Incentive Compensation, and Bonus Plan. A lump sum amount
                  equal to the payment to which the Participant would have been
                  entitled had all amounts awarded or granted to the
                  Participant, vested or matured, under any stock appreciation
                  right, incentive compensation, and bonus plans, which are
                  adopted after the effective date of the Participant's
                  Agreement and in which the Participant participates
                  immediately prior to the Relevant Date, including but not
                  limited to any substitute plans adopted prior to the Relevant
                  Date (or any successor or additional plan), which had not
                  vested or matured as of the date of termination of employment
                  and will not vest or mature as a result of the termination of
                  the Participant's employment, such payment to be determined as
                  though such award or grant had vested or matured on the date
                  of termination of the Participant's employment;

                           (f) Incentive Investment Plan. A lump sum amount
                  equal to any benefits under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation
                  Salaried Employees Incentive Investment Plan (or any successor
                  or additional plan) that the Participant has accrued, but that
                  are forfeited as a result of his or her termination of
                  employment, based upon the value of the Participant's account
                  as of the most recent valuation date before the date of the
                  Qualified Termination of Employment;

                           (g) Retirement Contribution Plan. A lump sum amount
                  equal to (a) in the case of a Tier I Participant, the
                  Participant's annual Retirement Contributions under the
                  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Retirement Contribution Plan (or
                  any successor or additional plans) and the Kimberly-Clark
                  Corporation Retirement Contribution Excess Benefit Program (or
                  any successor or additional plans) (collectively, the
                  "Retirement Contribution Plan") to which the Participant would
                  have been entitled if he had remained employed by the
                  Corporation for the Severance Period at the rate



                  of annual compensation specified in Section 5(i) above except
                  that the Annual Bonus Amount shall be treated as earned for
                  the year in which termination occurred and the balance of the
                  Severance Period and no award actually earned in, and paid
                  for, the year in which termination occurred shall be
                  considered, plus (b) for all Participants, the excess of (I)
                  the benefits under the Retirement Contribution Plan to which
                  the Participant would be entitled if the Participant were
                  fully vested in all of his or her benefits under the
                  Retirement Contribution Plan at the date of termination of
                  employment, over (II) the value of the benefits to which the
                  Participant is actually entitled at the date of termination of
                  employment, based upon the value of the Participant's account
                  as of the most recent valuation date before the date of the
                  Qualified Termination of Employment;

                           (h) Salaried Retirement Plan. In the case of a Tier I

                  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan
                  (or any successor or additional plans) and the Second
                  Supplemental Benefit Plan to the Kimberly-Clark Corporation
                  Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan (or any successor or
                  additional plans) (collectively, the "Supplemental Plan") and
                  the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Salaried Employees' Retirement
                  Plan (or any successor or additional plans) (the "Salaried
                  Retirement Plan"), such benefit to be equal to the actuarial
                  present value of a straight life annuity without level income
                  option and in an amount equal to the excess of (a) the
                  benefits under the Salaried Retirement Plan and the
                  Supplemental Plan to which the Participant would have been
                  entitled in the form of a straight life annuity without level
                  income option if such Participant had remained employed by the
                  Corporation for the Severance Period, at the rate of annual
                  compensation specified in Section 5(i) above except that the
                  Annual Bonus Amount shall be treated as earned for the year in
                  which termination occurred and the balance of the Severance
                  Period and no award actually earned in, and paid for, the year
                  in which termination occurred shall be considered, over (b)
                  the benefits to which the Participant would actually have been
                  entitled under the Salaried Retirement Plan and the

                  mental Plan, had such benefit been paid in the form of a
                  straight life annuity without level income option; and

                           (i) Medical and Dental Benefits. A lump sum amount
                  equal to (a) the amount of the monthly premiums that the
                  Participant would be required to pay, if he or she elected
                  "COBRA" continuation coverage under the medical and dental
                  plans of the Corporation in which the Participant was
                  participating immediately before the Qualified Termination of
                  Employment, based upon the premium rates in effect as of the
                  date of the Qualified Termination of Employment, times (b) for
                  a Tier I Participant, 36, and for a Tier II Participant, 24.

              6.     Other Terms and Conditions. The Agreement to be entered
into pursuant to this Plan shall contain such other terms, provisions and
conditions not inconsistent with this Plan as shall be determined by the Board.
Where appearing in this Plan or the Agreement, the masculine shall include the
feminine and the plural shall include the singular, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise.

              7.     Non-Assignability. Each Participant's rights under this
Plan shall be non-transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution.

              8.     Unfunded Plan. The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the
Corporation  nor the Board shall be required to  segregate  any assets that
may at any  time  be  represented  by  benefits  under  the  Plan.  Neither  the
Corporation  nor the Board  shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be
paid under the Plan. Any liability of the  Corporation to any  Participant  with
respect to any benefit  shall be based solely upon any  contractual  obligations
created by the Plan and the Agreement;  no such obligation shall be deemed to be
secured by any pledge or any encumbrance on any property of the Corporation.

              9.     Certain Reduction of Payments by the Corporation to Tier II
Participants.

                     (a)   Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
              notwithstanding, in the event Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other
              certified public accounting firm designated by the Corporation
              (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all
              Payments would subject a Participant, other than a Participant
              entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 10 be-

<PAGE>

              low, to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine
              whether some amount of Separation Payments would meet the
              definition of a "Reduced Amount."  If the Accounting Firm
              determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate
              Separation Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount.  All
              fees payable to the Accounting Firm with respect to this Section 9
              shall be paid solely by the Corporation.

                     (b)   If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate
              Separation Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the
              Corporation shall promptly give the Participant notice to that
              effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof, and the
              Participant may then elect, in his or her sole discretion, which
              and how much of the Separation Payments shall be eliminated or
              reduced (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate
              Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise
              the Corporation in writing of his or her election within ten days
              of his receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the
              Participant within such ten-day period, the Corporation may elect
              which of such Separation Payments shall be eliminated or reduced
              (as long as after such election the Value of the aggregate
              Separation Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify
              the Participant promptly of such election.  All determinations
              made by the Accounting Firm under this Section shall be binding
              upon the Corporation and the Participant and shall be made within
              60 days of a termination of employment of the Participant.  As
              promptly as practicable following such determination, the
              Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Tier
              II Participant such Separation Payments as are then due to the
              Participant under this Plan and shall promptly pay to or
              distribute for the benefit of the Participant in the future such
              Separation Payments as become due to the Participant under this
              Plan.

                     (c)   While it is the intention of the Corporation to
              reduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant
              hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the
              Participant would thereby be increased, as a result of the
              uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the
              time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm

<PAGE>

              hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or
              distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of a
              Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so
              paid or distributed ("Overpayment") or that additional amounts
              which will have not been paid or distributed by the Corporation to
              or  for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to this Plan could
              have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case,
              consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.
              In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an
              Overpayment has been made, based upon the assertion of a
              deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation
              or the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high
              probability of success, any such benefit of a Participant shall be
              treated for all purposes as a loan to the Participant which the
              Participant shall repay to the Corporation together with interest
              at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)
              of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed
              to have been made and no amount shall be payable by a Participant
              to the Corporation if and to the extent such deemed loan and
              payment would not either reduce the amount on which the
              Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of
              the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that
              the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or
              substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has
              occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
              Corporation to or for the benefit of the Participant together with
              interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section
              7872(f)(2) of the Code.

              10.    Certain Additional Payments by the Corporation to Tier I
Participants.

                     (a)   Anything in this Plan or any Agreement to the
              contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth in the next
              sentence, in the event that it shall be determined that any
              Payment to a Tier I Participant would be subject to the Excise
              Tax, then the Tier I Participant shall be entitled to receive an
              additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such
              that, after payment by the Tier I Participant of all taxes (and
              any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
              including, without



              limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties
              imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
              Gross-Up Payment, the Tier I Participant retains an amount of the
              Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
              Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
              Section 10(a), if it shall be determined that the Tier I
              Participant would (absent this sentence) be entitled to the
              Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments
              does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up
              Payment shall be made to the Tier I Participant and the provisions
              of Section 9 of this Plan shall apply to that Tier I Participant.
              The Corporation's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this
              Section 10 shall not be conditioned upon the Tier I Participant's
              termination of employment.

                     (b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 10(c), all
              determinations required to be made under this Section 10,
              including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the
              amount of such  Gross-Up  Payment  and the  assumptions  to be
              utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made by the
              Accounting Firm. The Accounting  Firm shall provide  detailed
              supporting  calculations both to the Corporation and the Tier I
              Participant  within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from
              the Tier I  Participant  that there has  been a  Payment  or  such
              earlier  time as is  requested  by the Corporation.  All fees and
              expenses of the  Accounting  Firm shall be borne solely by the
              Corporation.  Any Gross-Up Payment,  as determined pursuant to
              this  Section 10, shall be paid by the  Corporation  to or for the
              benefit of the applicable Tier I Participant  within 5 days of the
              receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination.  Any determination
              by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the  Corporation and
              the Tier I Participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in the
              application of Section  4999 of the Code at the time of the
              initial  determination  by  the  Accounting  Firm  hereunder,  it
              is possible  that  Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made
              by the  Corporation  should have been  made  (an  "Underpayment"),
              consistent  with  the  calculations required to be made hereunder.
              In the event the Corporation  exhausts its  remedies  pursuant  to
              Section  10(c) and the Tier I  Participant thereafter is required
              to make a payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the Accounting Firm shall
              determine the amount of the

              Underpayment  that has occurred and any such  Underpayment  shall
              be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the
              Tier I Participant.

                     (c)   Each Tier I Participant shall notify the Corporation
              in  writing  of any  claim  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
              that,  if successful,  would  require  the  payment  by the
              Corporation  of the Gross-Up  Payment.  Such  notification  shall
              be  given  as  soon  as practicable,  but no later  than 10
              business  days  after  the Tier I Participant  is  informed  in
              writing  of  such  claim.  The  Tier  I Participant  shall apprise
              the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which
              such claim is requested  to be paid.  The Tier I Participant
              shall not pay such claim prior to the  expiration  of the 30-day
              period following the date on which the Tier I Participant gives
              such notice to the  Corporation  (or such shorter period ending on
              the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is
              due).  If the  Corporation  notifies the Tier I Participant  in
              writing prior to the expiration of such period that the
              Corporation  desires to contest such claim, the Tier I Participant
              shall:

                              (1) give the Corporation any information
                                  reasonably requested by the Corporation
                                  relating to such claim,

                              (2) take such action in connection with
                                  contesting such claim as the Corporation shall
                                  reasonably request in writing from time to
                                  time, including, without limitation,
                                  accepting legal representation with respect
                                  to such claim by an attorney reasonably
                                  selected by the Corporation,

                              (3) cooperate with the Corporation in good faith
                                  in order effectively to contest such claim,
                                  and

                              (4) permit the Corporation to participate in any
                                  proceedings relating to such claim;

              provided, however, that the Corporation shall bear and pay
              directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest
              and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and
              shall indemnify and hold the Tier I

<PAGE>

              Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or
              income tax (including interest and penalties) imposed as a result
              of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without
              limitation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(c),
              the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in
              connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may
              pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
              hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in
              respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay
              the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of
              the Tier I Participant and direct the Tier I Participant to sue
              for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and
              the Tier I Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a
              determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of
              initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the
              Corporation shall determine; provided, however, that, if the
              Corporation directs the Tier I Participant to pay such claim and
              directs the Tier I Participant to sue for a refund, the
              Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Tier I Participant
              harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
              (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such
              payment or with respect to any imputed income in connection with
              such payment; and provided, further, that any extension of the
              statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the
              taxable year of the Tier I Participant with respect to which such
              contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such
              contested amount. Furthermore, the Corporation's control of the
              contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the
              Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Tier I
              Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case
              may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or
              any other taxing authority.

                     (d)   If, after the receipt by a Tier I Participant of a
              Gross-Up Payment or payment by the Corporation of an amount on the
              Tier I Participant's behalf pursuant to Section 10(c), the Tier I
              Participant becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to
              the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with
              respect to such claim, the Tier I Participant shall (subject to
              the Corporation's complying with the require-

<PAGE>

              ments of Section 10(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the
              Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest
              paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If,
              after payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Tier I
              Participant's behalf pursuant to Section 10(c), a determination is
              made that the Tier I Participant shall not be entitled to any
              refund with respect to such claim and the Corporation does not
              notify the Tier I Participant in writing of its intent to contest
              such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after
              such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset,
              to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
              be paid.

                     (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the
              Corporation may, in its sole discretion, withhold and pay over
              to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing
              authority, for the benefit of a Tier I Participant, all or any
              portion of any Gross-Up Payment, and by signing an Agreement,
              the Tier I Participant shall consent to such withholding.

              11.    No Duty to Mitigate. In no event shall any Participant be
obligated  to seek  other  employment  or take any  other  action by way of
mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions
of  this  Plan,  and  such  amounts  shall  not be  reduced  whether  or not the
Participant obtains other employment.

              12.    Termination and Amendment of this Plan. The Board shall
have power at any time, in its discretion,  to amend,  abandon or terminate
this  Plan,  in whole or in  part;  except  that no  amendment,  abandonment  or
termination shall impair or abridge the obligations of the Corporation under any
Agreements  previously  entered  into  pursuant to this Plan except as expressly
permitted by the terms of such Agreements.

              13.    Successors. The Corporation shall require any successor
(whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,   consolidation  or
otherwise) to all or  substantially  all of its business and/or assets to assume
expressly  and agree to perform this Plan and the  Agreements in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform them if
no such succession had taken place.

              14.    Effective Date.  This amended and restated Plan shall
become effective on November 12, 2002.
