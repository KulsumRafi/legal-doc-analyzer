(TSX/NYSE: FDG), Teck Cominco Limited (TSX: TEK.A, TEK.B), Westshore Terminals
Income Fund (TSX: WTE.UN) and Sherritt Coal Partnership II, a partnership of
Sherritt International Corporation (TSX: S) and Ontario Teachers&#146; Pension Plan,
today announced an agreement to combine the metallurgical coal assets of
Fording, Teck Cominco and the Luscar Energy Partnership as part of a series of
transactions that will see Fording Inc. converted into the Fording Canadian
Coal Trust (the &#147;Fording Trust&#148;) under a plan of arrangement.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the agreement, Sherritt Coal Partnership II has agreed to withdraw
its amended offer dated January&nbsp;6, 2003, and return any and all shares tendered
to that offer to the original holders.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement builds on the previous transaction announced by Fording, Teck
Cominco and Westshore Terminals with the added participation of Sherritt,
Teachers&#146; and CONSOL Energy Inc. The completion of the transaction is subject
to customary conditions including receipt of customary regulatory approvals.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Even before this process began in October, our commitment has always been to
unlock the value in Fording for our shareholders. This agreement fulfills our
commitment and deserves the support of all Fording shareholders,&#148; said Richard
Haskayne, Chairman of Fording Inc. &#147; It allows shareholders to realize a
significant cash component for their Fording shares while also providing the
opportunity to continue as investors in the preeminent Canadian producer of
metallurgical coal.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement will result in the consolidation of metallurgical coal operations
in British Columbia&#146;s Elk Valley, providing even greater opportunities for
operational and marketing synergies than those available under any previous
proposal presented to Fording shareholders.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coal partnership contemplated by the agreement will be the world&#146;s second
largest metallurgical coal company, producing approximately 20% of global
seaborne high-quality metallurgical coal and with estimated 2003 sales of
approximately 25&nbsp;million tonnes compared with Fording&#146;s 14&nbsp;million tonnes.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>Arrangement Structure</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the previously proposed combination, Fording Trust will hold an
interest in a coal partnership that will hold Fording&#146;s and Teck Cominco&#146;s
metallurgical coal assets, and to which will be added the metallurgical coal
assets of Luscar and CONSOL. The Luscar/CONSOL assets consist of the Line Creek
mine, the Luscar mine, the undeveloped Cheviot deposit and a 46.4% interest in
Neptune Bulk Terminals (Canada) Ltd.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fording Trust will initially hold a 65% interest in the coal partnership and
100% of Fording&#146;s industrial minerals business. Teck Cominco will contribute
its metallurgical coal assets, including the Elkview mine and $125&nbsp;million to
the partnership for an initial 35% interest. As manager of the coal
partnership, Teck Cominco will have the right to earn up to an additional 5%
interest over a four-year period, bringing its interest to 40%, if the
partnership achieves specified operating synergies.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teck will no longer have the right to exchange its interest in the coal
partnership into units of the Fording Trust.

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing Fording shareholders, other than Teachers&#146;, will hold 18.3&nbsp;million
units of Fording Trust representing 38.8% of the trust. (All trust ownership
percentages assume full cash election).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherritt Coal Partnership II will invest $375&nbsp;million comprised of an
investment of $275&nbsp;million by Teachers&#146; and $100&nbsp;million by Sherritt, and will
own a 22.7% interest in Fording Trust. Because Teachers&#146; has agreed to accept
all units for its 3.2&nbsp;million Fording shares, it will hold a 6.7% interest in
Fording Trust directly.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teck Cominco and Westshore Terminals will each invest $150&nbsp;million in Fording
Trust units and each will own 9.1% of Fording Trust. The coal partnership also
will enter into a long-term port services contract with Westshore Terminals on
commercial terms previously negotiated between Fording and Westshore.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luscar and CONSOL will each receive 3.2&nbsp;million units of Fording Trust in
exchange for their contribution of assets, resulting in each having a 6.8%
interest.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fording Trust is expected to have pro forma consolidated capitalization of
approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion including pro forma consolidated debt of
approximately $336&nbsp;million, before working capital. Fording&#146;s existing foreign
exchange hedge contracts will remain in place.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherritt Coal Partnership II will purchase all of Fording&#146;s prairie coal
operations and assets for $225&nbsp;million. The Fording Trust will retain a
royalty, capped at a maximum of 5% of gross revenue, on production from certain
coal properties included in the sale.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon successful completion of the transaction, Fording has agreed to pay the
expenses incurred by Teck Cominco, Westshore Terminals and Sherritt Coal
Partnership II in carrying out the various transactions required to form the
new trust, to a maximum of $75&nbsp;million.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors of Fording Inc. has received the opinion of its
financial advisors, RBC Capital Markets, that the consideration under the plan
of arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Fording
shareholders. The Board of Directors of Fording unanimously recommend that
shareholders vote in favour of the new plan of arrangement.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fording shareholders will vote on a revised plan of arrangement to effect the
proposed transaction at a special meeting to be scheduled shortly with the
intention of completing the transaction in February 2003. They will shortly
receive a supplement to Fording&#146;s information circular, including the reasons
for the Board&#146;s recommendation that shareholders approve the plan.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fording expects that the combination, with its greater potential for synergies,
will result in significantly enhanced distributable cash flow per unit compared
with any of the previous alternatives presented to shareholders.

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the closing of the plan of arrangement is expected to be deferred to
February 2003, the level of distributable cash for the first quarter will not
reflect the full benefits of the trust structure.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fording Trust will have strong corporate governance features that meet the
highest standards of independence. Fording Trust will have a majority of
independent trustees and its operating company will have a majority of
independent board members.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Fording Trust will be Michael
Grandin, who is currently an independent director of Fording. Jim Gardiner will
be President and Chief Executive Officer of the coal partnership and will be
President of the Fording Trust.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian W. Delaney, Chairman of Sherritt commented: &#147;We are pleased that the
process we commenced in October has led to such a successful result for
Sherritt while at the same time contributing to the rationalization of the
Canadian coal industry. This consolidation transaction permits Sherritt to
leverage its investment in each of its metallurgical and thermal coal
businesses. The addition of the Fording Prairie operations and its substantial
reserves complement Luscar&#146;s already significant thermal coal position. By
adding the stable, long-term cash flow of the Genesee operation and the royalty
income from the thermal coal lands, Luscar&#146;s cash flow will be strengthened and
will become a larger influence on Sherritt&#146;s overall results. The
consolidation of our metallurgical operation with those of our new partners
offers the prospect of more efficient operations and a more substantial
presence in the international marketplace.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Teachers&#146; is pleased to have been the catalyst for the creation of this new
trust, which brings together Canada&#146;s premier metallurgical coal mining
properties,&#148; said Brian J. Gibson, Senior Vice-President of Global Active
Equities for Teachers&#146;. &#147;The high quality of the coal produced, the long life
of the reserve base, the prominent position the Fording Trust will have in
international metallurgical coal markets and the wealth of experience available
to manage these assets, makes the Fording Trust a benefit to Canada and an
attractive investment for Teachers&#146;. Investors will be able to participate in
a trust that will have a sound capital structure with excellent corporate
governance. We intend to fully support this new plan and will exchange our
Fording shares for units.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Thompson, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teck Cominco
Limited said: &#147;The agreement announced today creates a world class competitor
in the metallurgical coal industry. Teck Cominco, as manager of the coal
partnership, looks forward to creating substantial value through operating
efficiencies and other synergies. This transaction furthers our diversification
strategy, adding a substantial stake in a 25&nbsp;million tonne coal producer to our
existing base metal and other interests.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westshore Terminals Income Fund Chairman William Stinson added: &#147;Westshore is
pleased to make a significant investment in units of this exciting new trust
and to have played a supporting role in bringing together Canada&#146;s three
principal metallurgical coal companies, all of which have been key customers
at the Westshore coal terminal for over

efficiencies created by this agreement will benefit everyone involved.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We are embarking on the most significant transformation in the history of the
Canadian coal industry,&#148; said Jim Gardiner, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Fording Inc. &#147;For the past several months, we have managed a process
that has resulted in substantial value realized for our shareholders. However,
on behalf of the management teams at each company, I want to assure all employees of our commitment to making this transition as smooth as possible.
There will be changes, but we will all benefit from being part of a larger,
stronger and more competitive organization.&#148;
