of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a
breach of the covenants in this Section 3, and because of the immediate and
irreparable damage that could be caused to the Company for which it would have
no other adequate remedy, Executive agrees that the foregoing covenant may be
enforced by the Company in the event of breach by Executive, by injunctions and
restraining orders.</font></p>

is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenants in this Section 3 impose
a reasonable restraint on Executive in light of the activities and business of
the Company and its subsidiaries on the date of the execution of this Agreement
and the current plans of the Company and its subsidiaries, but it is also the
intent of the Company and Executive that such covenants be construed and enforced
in accordance with the changing activities, business and locations of the
Company and its subsidiaries throughout the term of this covenant, whether
before or after the date of termination of the employment of Executive.&#160; For example, if, during the term of this
Agreement, the Company or any of its subsidiaries engages in new and different
activities, enters a new business or establishes new locations for its current
activities or business in addition to or other than the activities or business
enumerated under the recitals above or the locations currently established
therefor, then Executive will be precluded from soliciting the customers or
employees of such new activities or business or from such new location and from
directly competing with such new business within 200 miles of its
then-established operating location(s) through the term of this covenant.&#160; It is further agreed by the parties hereto
that, in the event that Executive shall cease to be employed hereunder, and
shall enter into a business or pursue other activities not in competition with
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or similar activities or business in
locations the operation of which, under such circumstances, does not violate
clause (a) of this Section 3, and in any event such new business, activities or
location are not in violation of this Section 3 or of Executive&#146;s obligations
under this Section 3, if any, Executive shall not be chargeable with a
violation of this Section 3 if the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall
thereafter enter the same, similar or a competitive (i) business, (ii) course
of activities or (iii) location, as applicable unless the business plans of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries known to Executive at the time of
Executive&#146;s termination of employment include similar lines of business or
activities.&#160; Executive further expressly
agrees that employment by the Company and the compensation Executive receives
from the Company pursuant to this Agreement is adequate consideration for the
obligations of Executive under this Section&nbsp;3.</font></p>

covenants in this Section 3 are severable and separate, and the
unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of
any other covenant.&#160; Moreover, in the
event any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time
or territorial restrictions set forth are too broad or unreasonable, then it is
the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest
extent which the court deems reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be
reformed.&#160; If any portion of this
Section 3 shall be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall in no way be deemed or construed to affect in any way
the enforceability of any other portion of this Section 3.</font></p>
