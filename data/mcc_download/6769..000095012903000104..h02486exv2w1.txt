      retains, unto itself, its Affiliates, successors and assigns the Excluded
      Properties.

2.2   Purchase Price. The total purchase price, subject to adjustments as
      described below, that Buyer shall pay Seller (on behalf of Seller and BP
      America) for the Properties is Six Hundred Seventy Million United States
      Dollars (US $670,000,000) ("PURCHASE PRICE"), payable in full at Closing
      in immediately available funds. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
      follows:

      (a)   Increased by Computed Interest for the period from the Effective
            Time through the Closing Date;

      (b)   Decreased by the amount of Operating Revenues to which Buyer is
            entitled under Article 6.2 but which are collected and retained by
            Seller;

      (c)   Increased by US $450,000 per month (pro-rated on a daily basis for
            any partial month) pursuant to Article 6.2(b);

      (d)   Increased by the amount of Charges for which Buyer is responsible
            under Article 6.2 but which are paid by Seller;

      (e)   Decreased by the amount of Charges for which Seller is responsible
            under Article 6.2 but which are paid by Buyer;

      (f)   Increased by amounts to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Article
            6.1 with respect to inventory;

      (g)   Increased by the amount of taxes and assessments for which Buyer is
            responsible under Article 6.3 but which are paid by Seller;

      (h)   Decreased by the amount of taxes or assessments for which Seller is
            responsible under Article 6.3 but which are paid by Buyer;

      (i)   Increased by amounts owing by Buyer pursuant to Article 6.4;

      (j)   Increased or decreased, as appropriate, pursuant to Article 6.5;

            pursuant to Article 4.2;


                                       12
<PAGE>
      (l)   Decreased by the agreed or arbitrated net adjustment, if any, to
            which Buyer is entitled for Alleged Adverse Conditions pursuant to
            Article 5.2;

      (m)   Decreased or increased, as appropriate, by any adjustments made for
            Properties excluded pursuant to Article 3.1;

      (n)   Decreased for any agreed reduction in value pursuant to Article 7.2,
            and decreased or increased, as appropriate, by any adjustments made
            for Properties excluded pursuant to Article 7.2; and

      (o)   Increased or decreased, as the case may be, by any other amount
            mutually agreed to by the Parties in writing.

      The Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE
      PRICE."

2.3   Performance Deposit. Upon execution of this Agreement and prior to its
      delivery to Buyer, Buyer shall deposit with Seller cash equal to the
      lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price or (ii)
      twenty million United States dollars (US $20,000,000) ("PERFORMANCE
      DEPOSIT"), provided however, that if this Agreement is executed on a day
      other than a Business Day, Buyer shall deliver the Performance Deposit to
      Seller on the next Business Day.

2.4   State Water Properties. Title to the BP America Properties is currently
      held by BP America, an Affiliate of Seller. Seller agrees to cause BP
      America to comply with the terms of the various covenants contained in
      Article 12 that are expressly applicable to BP America under the terms
      thereof and to provide the deliveries at Closing required of BP America
      under the terms of Article 16, and shall be liable for BP America's
      failure to comply to the same extent as if Seller had failed to comply.
      Seller's representations, indemnities and agreements under this Agreement
      with respect to the Properties shall apply to the BP America Properties as
      fully as if title to such Properties were held by Seller.

                         ARTICLE 3. PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS

3.1   Preferential Rights To Purchase. Seller shall use Buyer's Allocations to
      provide any required preferential right to purchase notifications as
      promptly as practicable after Buyer has furnished Buyer's Allocations,
      based on the form of Preferential Purchase Right Notice Letter attached
      hereto as Exhibit "L". If, prior to the Closing Date, a holder of a
      preferential purchase right notifies Seller that it elects to exercise its
      rights with respect to the Properties to which its preferential purchase
      right applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which
      the preferential purchase right arises), the Properties covered by that
      preferential purchase right will not be sold to the Party originally
      executing this Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the remaining provisions
      in this Article), and the Purchase Price will be reduced by Buyer's
      Allocations for such Properties if Buyer's Allocations are positive
      numbers and increased by Buyer's Allocations for such Properties if
      Buyer's Allocations are negative numbers. Buyer remains obligated to
      purchase the remainder of the Properties not affected by exercised
      preferential rights to purchase. If for any reason, other than Seller's
      breach, the purchase


                                       13
<PAGE>
      and sale of the Properties covered by the preferential purchase right is
      not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the preferential purchase
      right, Seller shall so notify Buyer promptly, but no later than thirty
      (30) Days after the date set forth in Article 17.1.4, and within ten (10)
      Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell,
      assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller
      such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the value
      allocated to such Properties in Buyer's Allocations (except "CLOSING DATE"
      with respect to such Properties shall mean the date of assignment of such
      Properties from Seller to Buyer). Any preferential purchase right must be
      exercised subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
      including successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 16.

                             ARTICLE 4. TITLE REVIEW

4.1   Review of Title Records. After execution and delivery of this Agreement,
      Seller shall make available (during Seller's regular business hours and at
      their current location) for Buyer's review, Records in Seller's possession
      or under Seller's control relating to title to the Properties. If Buyer
      requests copies of title Records, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
      provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyer's expense. Such review of
      Records will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the
      Confidentiality Agreement.

4.2   Alleged Title Defects.

      (a)   Should Seller's Disposition Team discover a Title Defect on or
            before Closing, Seller shall as soon as practicable, but in any
            event prior to Closing, deliver to Buyer a notice including a
            specific description of the Title Defect and the Real Properties
            affected. As soon as reasonably practicable (and on an ongoing
            basis), but no later than fifteen (15) Days prior to Closing, Buyer
            may notify Seller in writing of any Alleged Title Defects. Buyer's
            notice asserting Alleged Title Defects must include a reasonably
            detailed description and explanation (including any available
            supporting documentation) of each Alleged Title Defect claimed, the
            Real Properties affected, and the value Buyer in good faith
            attributes to the Alleged Title Defect. Buyer and Seller shall meet
            from time-to-time to attempt to agree on resolution with respect to
            Alleged Title Defects. Seller shall have the right, but not the
            obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove on or
            before the Closing Date any Alleged Title Defects with respect to
            the Real Properties. If prior to Closing, Seller has commenced to
            cure the Alleged Title Defect in a timely manner and pursues such
            cure diligently, then Seller may, by notice to Buyer prior to
            Closing, elect to continue diligently attempting to cure such defect
            to completion for up to one hundred eighty (180) Days following
            Closing.

      (b)   Should Buyer's Acquisition Team discover any Title Benefit on or
            before Closing, Buyer shall as soon as practicable, but in any case
            prior to Closing, deliver to Seller a notice including a specific
            description of the Title Benefit and the Real Properties affected.
            Seller shall have the right to deliver to Buyer a similar notice on
            or before Closing with respect to each Title Benefit discovered


                                       14
<PAGE>
            by Seller, which in the case of Seller, shall include the value
            Seller in good faith attributes to the Title Benefit.

      (c)   A Purchase Price adjustment shall be made under Article 2.2(k) by
            reducing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all actual
            Alleged Title Defects timely reported under this Article (or of
            which Seller had knowledge and should have reported under Article
            4.2(a)) and not timely cured as permitted under this Article, and
            increasing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all
            actual Title Benefits timely reported under this Article (or of
            which Buyer had knowledge and should have reported under Article
            4.2(b)), subject to the other terms of this Article. The value
            attributable to the uncured Alleged Title Defects shall be
            determined as follows:

            (i)   Where Seller agrees in writing with the value of the Alleged
                  Title Defect as set forth in Buyer's notice, that value shall
                  be the value of the Alleged Title Defect.

            (ii)  If the Alleged Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other
                  charge upon a Real Property which is undisputed and liquidated
                  in amount, then the value of the Alleged Title Defect shall be
                  the amount necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the
                  Alleged Title Defect from the affected Real Property.

            (iii) If the Buyer's Allocation for any Real Property is positive
                  and the Alleged Title Defect represents a discrepancy between
                  the Net Revenue Interest for such Real Property and the Net
                  Revenue Interest for that Real Property stated on Exhibit "A",
                  then the value of such Alleged Title Defect shall be the
                  product of the Buyer's Allocation for such Real Property
                  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                  decrease in Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which
                  is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit "A".

            (iv)  If the Alleged Title Defect represents an obligation,
                  encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to
                  the affected Real Property of a type not described in
                  subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the value of the Alleged
                  Title Defect shall be determined by taking into account
                  Buyer's Allocation for the Real Property so affected, the
                  portion of the Real Property affected by the Alleged Title
                  Defect, the legal effect of the Alleged Title Defect, the
                  potential economic effect of the Alleged Title Defect over the
                  life of the affected Real Property, and such other factors as
                  are necessary to make a proper evaluation. Where the affected
                  Real Property is an easement, right-of-way, servitude or
                  subsurface lease that is not given a separate Buyer's
                  Allocation, that easement, right-of-way, servitude or
                  subsurface lease shall be considered a part of the Real
                  Property or Real Properties to which it is appurtenant for
                  purposes of taking into account Buyer's Allocation.


                                       15
<PAGE>
            The Parties agree for all purposes of this Article 4 that Buyer's
            Allocation for each Real Property is the value of that Real Property
            if it has the Net Revenue Interest and Working Interest stated on
            Exhibit "A" and is free of liens, claims and encumbrances other than
            Permitted Encumbrances. The value of any Alleged Title Defect or
            Title Benefit consisting of a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest
            and/or Working Interest shall be determined solely by starting with
            the Buyer's Allocation and calculating the effect of the percentage
            change in Net Revenue Interest and/or Working Interest. Such
            calculation shall be based on the same assumptions with respect to
            production rate, production profile, price, and amounts of future
            capital expenditures as were used in the calculation of Buyer's
            Allocation, which assumptions shall be disclosed to Seller and any
            applicable arbitrator. Furthermore, if an Alleged Title Defect is
            reasonably susceptible of being cured, the adjustments or payments
            with respect to that Alleged Title Defect shall not exceed the
            reasonable costs of cure.

      (d)   If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a resolution
            associated with any Alleged Title Defects raised by Buyer (or of
            which Seller had knowledge and should have reported under Article
            4.2(a)), the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being
            reduced by Seller's estimate of the value of all uncured Alleged
            Title Defects, in accordance with Article 4.2(c), excluding those
            Alleged Title Defects with respect to which Seller has provided
            notice of its election to continue curing under Article 4.2(a);
            provided, however, that within thirty (30) Days after the Closing
            Date, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance
            with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the
            dispute. If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a
            resolution associated with any Title Benefit raised pursuant to
            Article 4.2(b) (or of which Buyer had knowledge and should have
            reported under Article 4.2(b)), the Parties shall Close with the
            Purchase Price being increased by Seller's estimate of the increase
            in the value of the Properties above that shown in Buyer's
            Allocations (including any reduction in the negative value of any
            Property with a negative Buyer's Allocation) as a consequence of the
            Title Benefit, subject to the right of either Party to initiate
            binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in
            Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute.

      (e)   If by one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing, Seller has
            failed to cure any Alleged Title Defects with respect to which
            Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under
            Article 4.2(a), and the Parties have been unable by such date to
            agree upon a resolution associated with such Alleged Title Defects,
            then Seller shall make a payment to Buyer equal to Seller's estimate
            of the value of such uncured Alleged Title Defects, in accordance
            with Article 4.2(c). Within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred
            eighty (180) Day cure period has expired, either Party may initiate
            binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in
            Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute.

      (f)   ANY CLAIM FOR PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT, AND
            ANY ASSERTION THAT ANY ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT FOR WHICH SELLER HAS
            PROVIDED NOTICE OF ITS INTENT TO CURE HAS NOT BEEN CURED, THAT ARE
            NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT OF


                                       16
<PAGE>
            THE PARTIES OR REFERRED TO ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS
            FOLLOWING CLOSING (OR, IN THE EVENT SELLER PROVIDES NOTICE THAT IT
            WILL CONTINUE ATTEMPTING TO CURE THE ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT AFTER
            CLOSING, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180)
            DAY CURE PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING HAS EXPIRED) SHALL BE DEEMED
            WAIVED, UNLESS THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL
            WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.

      (g)   Any limitations contained in the definition of Alleged Title Defect
            or in this Article 4.2 on Buyer's right to compensation with respect
            to any Title Defect shall have no effect on Buyer's right to
            compensation, if any, with respect to any Claim for damages or other
            matter (except title) involving the Real Property subject to the
            Title Defect under any other provision of this Agreement.

      (h)   Seller's election to attempt to cure an Alleged Title Defect shall
            not constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence,
            nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Alleged Title Defect.
            Buyer's acceptance of any payment or adjustment based on Seller's
            estimate of the value of an uncured Alleged Title Defect shall not
            constitute a waiver of Buyer's right to dispute such estimate by
            initiating arbitration within the time permitted by this Article.

4.3   Waiver. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE GIVEN BY SELLER IN
      ARTICLE 10.1.6, BUYER WAIVES FOR ALL PURPOSES ALL OBJECTIONS ASSOCIATED
      WITH THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING ALLEGED TITLE DEFECTS), UNLESS
      RAISED BY PROPER NOTICE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN
      ARTICLE 4.2; AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND
      ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST
      SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME.

                        ARTICLE 5. INSPECTION OF PREMISES

5.1   Inspection of Premises. After execution and delivery of this Agreement,
      Seller shall provide Buyer access (during Seller's regular business hours)
      to Seller-operated Properties, and Seller will use reasonable efforts to
      obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to third party-operated
      Properties, to inspect the condition of the same. Such inspection shall be
      conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
      and subject to any boarding agreements or releases or other agreements
      required by the operator of the Properties and the rules and regulations
      of such operator with respect to health, safety and the environment. Buyer
      may not operate equipment during such inspection. At Buyer's reasonable
      request, Seller shall conduct tests for sustained casing pressure on wells
      included in the Properties and any other equipment tests that Seller's
      on-site personnel deem reasonably acceptable in connection with Buyer's
      site visits. Buyer may not conduct testing or sampling of materials during
      such inspection without Seller's prior written consent, such consent not
      to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and Seller shall use good faith
      efforts, considering the circumstances, to respond to Buyer's requests
      made while on-site on a Property prior to Buyer's departure from the
      Property). Seller shall arrange, at Buyer's cost, for any transportation
      to and from any such Properties as is reasonably requested by Buyer. BUYER
      TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD


                                       17
<PAGE>
      HARMLESS SELLER GROUP, THE OTHER OWNERS OF INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTIES AND
      THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND
      REPRESENTATIVES, FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, CAUSES OF
      ACTION, LOSSES, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, FINES, PENALTIES AND COSTS
      (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF LITIGATION), INCLUDING THOSE FOR
      (1) ANY INJURY TO PERSONS (INCLUDING OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
      AGENTS, CONSULTANTS, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND OTHER
      REPRESENTATIVES OF BUYER (COLLECTIVELY, "BUYER'S REPRESENTATIVES") OR
      SELLER GROUP); (2) DAMAGES TO PROPERTY (INCLUDING DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTY
      OF THIRD PARTIES, PROPERTY OF SELLER GROUP, AND PROPERTY OF BUYER AND
      BUYER'S REPRESENTATIVES); AND (3) DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES OR
      ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES, TO THE EXTENT
      CAUSED BY, ARISING OUT OF, OR RESULTING FROM THE ACTIONS OF BUYER AND/OR
      BUYER'S REPRESENTATIVES IN CONNECTION WITH SAID SITE VISIT OR PHYSICAL
      INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTIES, EVEN IF SUCH INDEMNIFIED EVENT IS CAUSED
      BY, ARISES OUT OF OR RESULTS FROM NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF
      DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), VIOLATION OF LAW OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY OF
      THE AFORESAID INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT, BUT NOT TO
      THE EXTENT THAT SUCH INDEMNIFIED EVENT OR OCCURRENCE IS CAUSED BY OR THE
      RESULT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED
      PARTIES. As promptly as practicable, and taking into account to the extent
      practicable any priorities of which Buyer has provided notice, but in any
      event within ten (10) Business Days after execution and delivery of this
      Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Seller's regular business
      hours and at their current location) for Buyer's review, Records in
      Seller's possession or under Seller's control relating to the Properties.
      If Buyer requests copies of Records, Seller shall use reasonable efforts
      to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyer's expense. Such review
      of Records will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the
      Confidentiality Agreement.

5.2   Alleged Adverse Conditions.

      (a)   As soon as reasonably practicable (and on an ongoing basis), but no
            later than fifteen (15) Days prior to Closing, Buyer may notify
            Seller in writing of any Alleged Adverse Conditions. Buyer's notice
            asserting Alleged Adverse Conditions must include a reasonably
            detailed description and explanation (including any available
            supporting documentation) of each Alleged Adverse Condition claimed,
            the Properties affected, and the value Buyer in good faith
            attributes to the Alleged Adverse Condition. Buyer and Seller shall
            meet from time-to-time to attempt to agree on resolution with
            respect to Alleged Adverse Conditions. Seller shall have the right,
            but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or
            remove on or before the Closing Date any Alleged Adverse Conditions
            with respect to the Properties. If prior to Closing, Seller has
            commenced to cure the Alleged Adverse Condition in a timely manner
            and pursues such cure diligently, then Seller may, by notice to
            Buyer prior to Closing, elect to continue diligently attempting to
            cure such condition to completion for up to one hundred eighty (180)
            Days following Closing.

      (b)   A Purchase Price adjustment shall be made under Article 2.2(l) by
            reducing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all actual
            Alleged Adverse Conditions timely reported under this Article and
            not timely cured as permitted


                                       18
<PAGE>
            under this Article, subject to Article 5.2(g) and the other terms of
            this Article. When calculating the value of any Alleged Adverse
            Conditions, if an Alleged Adverse Condition is reasonably
            susceptible of being cured, the adjustments or payments with respect
            to that Alleged Adverse Condition shall not exceed the reasonable
            costs of cure.

      (c)   Notwithstanding the other terms of this Article 5.2, Seller may
            elect by notice to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to
            the Closing Date to exclude from this Agreement any Real Property
            and associated personal Property affected by an Alleged Adverse
            Condition of which Buyer has provided timely notice if (i) the Real
            Property has a positive Buyer's Allocation and the cumulative
            adjustments and payments associated with the effects of Alleged
            Adverse Conditions on such Real Property and associated personal
            Property would exceed Buyer's Allocation for such Real Property or
            (ii) the Real Property has a negative Buyer's Allocation. In the
            event any Property is excluded from this Agreement pursuant to this
            Article, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Buyer's Allocation
            for such Property, and no other adjustment shall be made with
            respect to such Property.

      (d)   If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a resolution
            associated with any Alleged Adverse Conditions raised by Buyer, the
            Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being reduced by
            Seller's estimate of the value of all uncured Alleged Adverse
            Conditions, excluding those Alleged Adverse Conditions with respect
            to which Seller has provided notice of its election to continue
            curing under Article 5.2(a); provided, however, that within thirty
            (30) Days after the Closing Date, either Party may initiate binding
            arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article
            18.1 to resolve the dispute.

      (e)   If by one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing, Seller has
            failed to cure any Alleged Adverse Conditions with respect to which
            Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under
            Article 5.2(a), and the Parties have been unable by such date to
            agree upon a resolution associated with such Alleged Adverse
            Conditions, Seller shall make a payment to Buyer equal to Seller's
            estimate of the value of such uncured Alleged Adverse Conditions.
            Within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day cure
            period has expired, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in
            accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve
            the dispute.

      (f)   ANY CLAIM FOR PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION,
            AND ANY ASSERTION THAT ANY ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION FOR WHICH
            SELLER HAS PROVIDED NOTICE OF ITS INTENT TO CURE HAS NOT BEEN CURED,
            THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES OR REFERRED TO
            ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING CLOSING (OR, IN THE
            EVENT SELLER PROVIDES NOTICE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ATTEMPTING TO
            CURE THE ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITIONS AFTER CLOSING, WITHIN THIRTY
            (30) DAYS AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAY CURE PERIOD
            FOLLOWING CLOSING HAS EXPIRED) SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED, UNLESS THE
            THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF
            THE PARTIES.

      (g)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
            contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to an adjustment or other
            remedy under Articles 5.2, 8.3 or 8.4 unless the aggregate value
            (determined in accordance with those Articles) of all Alleged
            Adverse Conditions, Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental
            Claims timely reported under those Articles and not cured by Seller
            exceeds seventeen million five hundred thousand United States
            dollars (US $17,500,000), and then only to the extent such aggregate
            value exceeds seventeen million five hundred thousand United States
            dollars (US $17,500,000), and as between Buyer and Seller Group,
            Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and
            expenses associated with any and all Alleged Adverse Conditions,
            Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental Claims up to seventeen
            million five hundred thousand United States dollars (US
            $17,500,000).

      (h)   Seller's election to attempt to cure an Alleged Adverse Condition
            shall not constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the
            existence, nature, or value of, or cost to cure, the Alleged Adverse
            Condition. Buyer's acceptance of any payment or adjustment based on
            Seller's estimate of the value of an uncured Alleged Adverse
            Condition shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer's right to dispute
            such estimate by initiating arbitration within the time period
            permitted by this Article.

5.3   Waiver. BUYER WAIVES FOR ALL PURPOSES ALL OBJECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
      ENVIRONMENTAL AND PHYSICAL AND OTHER CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES
      (INCLUDING ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITIONS), UNLESS RAISED BY PROPER NOTICE
      WITHIN THE APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 5.2; AND BUYER (ON
      BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
      ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT CLAIMS UNDER SELLER'S INDEMNITIES PURSUANT TO
      ARTICLES 8.2, 8.3 AND 8.4, THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED
      WITH THE SAME.

      such oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances at a price equal to the average
      price received by Seller from sales during the month of December 2002 of
      comparable oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances from each field from
      which such substances were produced, net of royalties, excise, severance
      and other production taxes, and marketing costs (which include for
      purposes hereof, among other things, costs of gathering, treating,
      processing, compression, and transportation), to the extent such items are
      not treated as "Charges" under this Article 6. Oil and liquid hydrocarbon
      substances in treating and separation equipment upstream of pipeline

      period on and after the Effective Time. Actual amounts shall be accounted
      for in the Final Accounting Settlement, unless previously accounted for
      under the Transition Agreement. Whether Charges and Operating Revenues
      with respect to the Properties are attributable to periods before or after
      the Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with United States
      generally accepted accounting principles (as published by the Financial
      Accounting Standards Board) and Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies
      (COPAS) standards, based on the accrual method of accounting.

6.3   Taxes. Seller (or, if applicable, BP America) shall bear all taxes and
      assessments, including excise taxes, severance or other production taxes,

      belong to Seller (or BP America). Buyer shall bear all taxes and
      assessments, including sales taxes, excise taxes, severance or other
      production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state or local
      taxes and assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the
      Properties on and after the Effective Time (excluding Seller's and BP
      America's income taxes from the Effective Time through Closing); and all
      deductions, credits and refunds pertaining to the aforementioned taxes and
      assessments, no matter when received, belong to Buyer. Ad valorem or
      property or other taxes based on revenue from the Properties shall apply
      to the tax year for which the tax rendition is issued and be prorated

      after the Effective Time. Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the
      Final Accounting Settlement. Buyer shall bear all Sales Tax, if any, on

6.6   Final Accounting Settlement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but no
      later than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the end of the Transition
      Period, Seller shall deliver the Final Accounting Statement to Buyer. As
      soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) Days after
      Buyer receives the Final Accounting Statement, Buyer may deliver to Seller
      a written report containing any changes Buyer proposes to such statement.
      Any matters covered by the Final Accounting Statement as delivered by
      Seller to which Buyer fails to object in the written report shall be
      deemed correct and is final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
      further review, audit or arbitration. As soon as reasonably practicable,
      but no later than forty-five (45) Days after Seller receives Buyer's
      written report, the Parties shall meet to attempt to agree on any
      adjustments to the Final Accounting Statement. If the Parties fail to
      agree on final adjustments within that forty-five (45) Day period, either
      Party may submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee no later
      than the thirtieth (30th) Day following the expiration of such forty-five
      (45) Day period. ANY ADJUSTMENT DISPUTE THAT IS NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT
      OF THE PARTIES OR SUBMITTED TO THE ACCOUNTING REFEREE BY SUCH THIRTIETH
      (30TH) DAY SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED UNLESS THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS
      EXTENDED BY MUTUAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. The Parties shall
      direct the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty (30)
      Days after its receipt of relevant materials pertaining to the dispute.
      The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
      determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and
      may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any
      matter. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the Accounting Referee's fees
      and expenses. The Final Accounting Statement, whether as agreed between
      the Parties or as determined by a decision of the Accounting Referee,
      shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. Within fifteen (15)
      Business Days after the earlier of (i) the date the amounts are agreed by
      the Parties and (ii) the date the Parties receive the Accounting Referee's
      decision (A) Buyer shall pay to Seller (on behalf of itself and BP
      America) the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the
      Closing Payment, or (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the
      Closing Payment exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any
      post-Closing payment pursuant to this Article 6.6 shall bear Computed
      Interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment. The revenues and
      expenses included in the Final Accounting Settlement shall be final and
      binding on the Parties and not subject to further review, audit or
      arbitration.

6.7   Post-Final Accounting Settlement Revenues. (a) Buyer shall pay Seller (on
      behalf of itself and BP America) any and all Operating Revenues received
      by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting
      Settlement or under the Transition Agreement) attributable to the
      Properties prior to the Effective Time, and (b) Seller shall pay Buyer any
      and all Operating Revenues received by Seller (or BP America) (to the
      extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement or under the
      Transition Agreement) attributable to the Properties on and after the
      Effective Time. The Party responsible for the payment of Operating
      Revenues shall make full payment to the other Party, together with
      reasonably available supporting documentation with respect to such
      amounts, within sixty (60) Days after receipt of such amounts.

6.8   Post-Final Accounting Settlement Expenses. (a) Seller shall reimburse
      Buyer for any and all Charges paid by Buyer (to the extent not accounted
      for in the Final Accounting


                                       22
<PAGE>
      Settlement or under the Transition Agreement) attributable to the
      Properties prior to the Effective Time, and (b) Buyer shall reimburse
      Seller (on behalf of itself and BP America) for any and all Charges paid
      by Seller (or BP America) (to the extent not accounted for in the Final
      Accounting Settlement or under the Transition Agreement) attributable to
      the Properties on and after the Effective Time. The Party responsible for
      the payment of such Charges shall make full payment to the other Party
      within sixty (60) Days after receipt of an applicable invoice and proof
      that such invoice was paid. Seller or BP America, as applicable, shall be
      entitled to resolve all joint interest audits or other audits of such
      costs for periods for which Seller or BP America is responsible, and
      neither Party shall agree to settle any audit with respect to periods for
      which the other is in part responsible without the prior written consent
      of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                   ARTICLE 7. LOSS, CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION

7.1   Notice of Loss. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of all instances of
      Casualty Loss that occur and become known to Seller between the date of
      this Agreement and Closing.

7.2   Casualty Loss. If, prior to Closing, a portion of the Properties is
      damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Buyer shall meet to
      attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the
      "reduction in value" of the Properties because of such Casualty Loss. For
      this purpose, "reduction in value" is based on the principle that Seller
      should generally bear the costs of repairing the Properties to the state
      existing immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair
      results in equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from
      that which existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Buyer should
      bear a portion of such costs that is equitable under the circumstances
      because of the benefit to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment or
      facilities. Except as to those Real Properties with a negative Buyer's
      Allocation, no adjustment associated with a Casualty Loss shall exceed
      Buyer's Allocation for the affected Property. For those Real Properties
      with a negative Buyer's Allocation, Buyer may give Seller written notice
      at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing and exclude from this
      Agreement the Real Property subject to the Casualty Loss and increase the
      Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Buyer's Allocation for such Real
      Property. If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Casualty
      Loss, the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being reduced by
      Seller's estimate of the reduction in the value of the Properties as a
      result of the Casualty Loss; provided, however, either Party may, within
      sixty (60) Days after the Closing Date (but not later), initiate binding
      arbitration in accordance with Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. Any
      claim for a Casualty Loss not referred to arbitration within sixty (60)
      Days after Closing shall be deemed waived. Notwithstanding the preceding,
      if a platform is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Buyer may elect
      by notice to Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
      Date to exclude from this Agreement the Real Properties on which wells
      served by such platform are located and other related Properties and the
      Purchase Price shall be reduced by Buyer's Allocations for such Real
      Properties, and no other adjustment shall be made with respect to such
      platform and other Properties. Seller shall retain any and all insurance
      proceeds and other payments associated with or attributable to any
      pre-Closing Casualty Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate
      Casualty Losses and


                                       23
<PAGE>
      Property exclusions under this Article exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
      the Purchase Price, either Party may, by notice to the other at least one
      Business Day prior to Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement under
      Article 17.1.5.

            ARTICLE 8. ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES

8.1   OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE
      OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ALL RELEASE, INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE PROVISIONS IN

      OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION
      OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY PART THEREOF ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME (NO

      FROM AND AGAINST ALL ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR
      CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE

      OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY PART THEREOF ON AND AFTER
      THE EFFECTIVE TIME. THESE INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATIONS APPLY
      REGARDLESS OF CAUSE OR OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS (INCLUDING SOLE
      NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF DUTY
      (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), VIOLATION OF LAW, OR OTHER FAULT OF SELLER
      GROUP, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT.

8.7   Notice of Claims. If a Claim is asserted against a Party for which the
      other Party may have an obligation of indemnity and defense or may be
      entitled to indemnity or defense (whether under this Article 8 or any
      other provision of this Agreement), the Party against whom the Claim is
      asserted shall give the other Party prompt written notice of the Claim,
      setting forth the particulars associated with the Claim (including a copy
      of the written Claim, if any) as then known by the Indemnified Party. In
      the event that the Party sending the notice is seeking indemnification
      under this Agreement, it shall include that request in its notice (a
      "CLAIM NOTICE"). Any Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
      Agreement shall be referred to herein as the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and the
      Party from whom the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification shall be
      referred to herein as the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY." The failure of any
      Indemnified Party to give prompt notice of a Claim as required by this
      Article shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
      this Agreement except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
      Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Claim.

8.8   Defense of Claims. Within thirty (30) Days after the Indemnifying Party
      receives a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
      Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party will assume
      responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. The Indemnified Party
      is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) Day period, to file
      any motion, pleading or other answer that it deems necessary or
      appropriate to protect its interests, or those of the Indemnifying Party,
      and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
      Party elects not to assume responsibility for


                                       26
<PAGE>
      defense and payment of the Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend
      against, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Claim as it
      deems appropriate without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any
      indemnification obligations the Indemnifying Party may have with respect
      to such Claim. The Indemnifying Party's failure to respond in writing to a
      Claim Notice within the thirty (30) Day period shall be deemed an election
      by the Indemnifying Party not to assume responsibility for defense and
      payment of the Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
      responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim: (a) the Indemnifying
      Party shall defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim with counsel of
      the Indemnifying Party's choice (reasonably acceptable to Indemnified
      Party which shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all reasonable
      respects in such defense), (b) the Indemnifying Party shall pay any
      judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Claim, (c) the
      Indemnifying Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter
      into any settlement with respect to the Claim that (i) does not include a
      provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
      Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to the Claim or (ii)
      contains terms that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
      Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity),
      and (d) if the Indemnified Party consents to entry of any judgment or
      enters into any settlement with respect to the Claim without the
      Indemnifying Party's prior written consent, then the Indemnified Party
      shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any right to indemnification
      under this Agreement with respect to such Claim. In all instances the
      Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel and participate in defense
      of a Claim, but the Indemnified Party shall bear all fees and expenses of
      counsel employed by the Indemnified Party.

8.9   No Duplication of Remedies. In no event shall either Party be entitled to
      duplicate compensation with respect to any Claim or breach of
      representation, warranty or agreement asserted under the terms of this
      Agreement, even though such Claim or breach may be addressed by more than
      one provision of this Agreement. Non-Environmental Claims and
      Environmental Claims are excluded from Charges, which are adjusted between
      the Parties in accordance with the terms of Article 6. Payments for Claims
      under Article 8 shall not effect allocations of Charges and Operating
      Revenues under Article 6 and allocations of Charges and Operating Revenues
      under Article 6 shall not effect payments for Claims under Article 8. For
      the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's claims for indemnification under this
      Agreement are limited to Seller's ownership interest in the asset giving
      rise to such a claim.

8.10  Other Contracts Between the Parties. The releases in this Article 8 are
      not intended to waive any existing contractual rights between any member
      of Seller Group and any member of Buyer Group under operating agreements,
      unit agreements, service contracts or other agreements not entered into
      and delivered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
      contemplated hereunder.

8.11  WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO
      SEEK INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN
      CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
      THE BREACH HEREOF. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS ARTICLE 8.11 DOES NOT
      DIMINISH OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PARTIES' RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS TO BE
      INDEMNIFIED AGAINST, AND PROVIDE INDEMNITY


                                       27

      FOR, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AWARDED TO ANY
      THIRD PARTY FOR WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR
      SELLER'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, INCLUDING THE PERFORMANCE
      DEPOSIT, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 17.2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
      TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER SHALL NOT BE
      REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY BUYER UNDER THIS ARTICLE 8 FOR AGGREGATE DAMAGES IN
      EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

      (XIII) SAFETY, (XIV) STATE OF REPAIR, (XV) MERCHANTABILITY, (XVI) FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND (XVII) CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF

      RIGHT TO CLAIM BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER ARTICLE

      MEDIUM) TO BUYER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES OR THE TRANSACTION
      CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT; AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND
      THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THEY
      MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME. FOR THE AVOIDANCE
      OF DOUBT, BUYER'S WAIVER OF CLAIMS UNDER THIS ARTICLE 9.2 DOES NOT WAIVE
      BUYER'S RIGHT TO ASSERT UNDER ARTICLE 5.2 THE EXISTENCE OF ALLEGED ADVERSE
      CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 1.1.6(B).

               ARTICLE 10. SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      bankruptcy, insolvency or other Laws relating to or affecting the
      enforcement of creditors' rights and general principles of equity
      (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
      at law or in equity).

      and consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will

      responsibility for such transfer fee or similar payment).

<PAGE>

      terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

      creditors' rights and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
      such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

      11.1.3 No Violations. Buyer's execution and delivery of this Agreement and
      consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not:

      (a)   conflict with or require consent of any person or entity under any

            its Affiliates to continue to conduct operations on, over and across
            such Properties, as specified on Schedule 12.2, in connection with
            properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates at Closing and not
            being conveyed from Seller to Buyer in the transactions contemplated
            by this Agreement, provided that where an existing Contract governs
            such use, the terms of such Contract shall continue to govern such
            use following Closing.

      (b)   At Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer recordable
            instruments, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller
            and Buyer, granting Buyer certain non-exclusive rights-of-way on,
            over and through properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates as of
            Closing other than the Properties and certain rights to use
            facilities (including pipeline usage rights, production handling
            arrangements, and other reasonable rights to use improvements), to
            the extent appropriate for Buyer to continue to operate the
            Properties in the manner in which they were being operated at the
            Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2, provided that where
            an existing Contract governs such use, the terms of such Contract
            shall continue to govern such use following Closing.

      (c)   Articles 12.2(a) and 12.2(b) are not intended to apply to facilities
            of a regional nature not associated with any particular field or
            field area (e.g. oil spill facilities, fire training facilities,
            shorebases, communications systems, etc.).


                                       32

      (d)   Provided that Buyer acquires Properties covering twenty (20) or more
            OCS blocks, Buyer shall be provided with certain mutually agreed
            rights to the shared use of certain of Seller's retained
            communication equipment to the extent appropriate for Buyer to
            continue to operate the Properties in the manner in which they were
            being operated at the Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2.

      (e)   Seller shall be provided with certain mutually agreed rights to the
            shared use of certain of Buyer's communication equipment transferred
            as part of the Properties to the extent appropriate for Seller to
            continue to operate properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates at
            Closing in the manner in which they were being operated at the
            Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2.

      (f)   Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to offer rights of use
            under Article 12.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(d) or 12.2(e) above, as
            applicable, if such use would materially impair that Party's ability
            to operate the Properties, or Seller's and its Affiliates' other
            properties, as applicable, in the manner they were being operated at
            the Effective Time or make it uneconomic to do so.

      (g)   It is the intent of the Parties that the arrangements described in
            Articles 12.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(d) and 12.2(e) above be on a
            cost-sharing basis with neither Seller nor Buyer making a profit or
            suffering a loss as a result of such arrangements. Without limiting
            the generality of the preceding sentence, the Party to whom a
            benefit is assigned or with whom a benefit is shared shall, where
            provided under the terms of the applicable agreement, pay its pro
            rata share, based on usage, of required payments to Third Parties
            for the use of the shared facilities. If either Party proposes to
            sell or abandon its interest in the shared improvements separately
            from its rights in the lease on which the facility is located, it is
            the intent of the Parties that the other Party shall have, in the
            case of a sale, a preferential right of purchase or, in the case of
            abandonment, the right to acquire the interest to be abandoned at a
            price equal to the estimated cost of abandonment less any salvage
            value, each of the foregoing subject to any applicable rights of
            Third Parties.

12.3  Buyer's Assumption of Obligations. If Closing occurs, Buyer effective at
      Closing assumes and shall timely perform and discharge all of Seller's
      duties and obligations associated with the Properties (including any and
      all contractual duties and obligations) relating to the period on and
      after the Closing Date, and in fulfilling these obligations, Buyer shall
      comply with Laws. Buyer shall provide Seller (and its employees and
      contractors) reasonable access to the Properties as may be necessary or
      convenient to Seller from time to time for Seller to exercise any retained
      rights or comply with any retained obligations Seller may have associated
      with the Properties.

12.4  Asbestos and NORM. The Properties may currently or have in the past
      contained asbestos and NORM, and special procedures associated with
      assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos
      and NORM may be necessary. It is the Parties' intent that Seller shall not
      be liable for and Buyer shall have no claim against Seller for the mere
      existence of asbestos or NORM on the Properties (except to the extent


                                       33
<PAGE>
      the asbestos or NORM is as of the date of execution of this Agreement in a
      condition that violates applicable Environmental Laws and Buyer would be
      entitled to a remedy with respect to such violation under another term of
      this Agreement) or Buyer's actions such as removal or remediation thereof.
      NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY,
      INCLUDING ARTICLE 8:

      (a)   IF CLOSING OCCURS, BUYER, FROM AND AFTER CLOSING, ACCEPTS
            SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND AGREES TO PAY ANY AND ALL
            COSTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSESSMENT,
            REMEDIATION, REMOVAL, TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF
            ASBESTOS AND NORM ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES, AND MAY
            NOT CLAIM THE FACT THAT ASSESSMENT, REMEDIATION, REMOVAL,
            TRANSPORTATION OR DISPOSAL OF ASBESTOS AND NORM ARE NOT
            COMPLETE OR THAT ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE
            REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH ASSESSMENT, REMEDIATION,
            REMOVAL, TRANSPORTATION OR DISPOSAL OF ASBESTOS AND NORM
            AS AN ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION OR A BREACH OF SELLER'S
            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
            THE BASIS FOR ANY OTHER REDRESS AGAINST SELLER, AND BUYER
            (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND
            ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THEY MAY
            HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME,
            EXCEPT (I) TO THE EXTENT THE ASBESTOS OR NORM IS AS OF
            THE DATE OF EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT IN A CONDITION
            THAT VIOLATES APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND BUYER
            WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
            VIOLATION UNDER ANOTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT OR (II)
            THE ASBESTOS OR NORM IS THE BASIS OF A CLAIM FOR DEATH OR
            BODILY INJURY THAT ACCRUED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME
            AND BUYER WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO
            SUCH CLAIM UNDER ANOTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT; AND

      (b)   IF CLOSING OCCURS, BUYER, FROM AND AFTER CLOSING,
            RELEASES SELLER GROUP FROM AND SHALL FULLY PROTECT,
            DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM
            AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING OUT
            OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
            ASSESSMENT, REMEDIATION, REMOVAL, TRANSPORTATION AND
            DISPOSAL OF ASBESTOS AND NORM FROM THE PROPERTIES AFTER
            THE EFFECTIVE TIME.  THIS INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE
            OBLIGATION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF CAUSE OR OF ANY
            NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE,
            CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF
            DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), VIOLATION OF LAW OR OTHER
            FAULT OF SELLER GROUP, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT.  FOR
            THE REMOVAL OF DOUBT, BUYER'S RELEASE UNDER THIS ARTICLE
            12.4(B) DOES NOT PREVENT BUYER FROM ASSERTING THE
            EXISTENCE OF AN ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION UNDER ARTICLE
            5.2 FOR ASBESTOS OR NORM THAT IS, AS OF THE DATE OF
            EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN A CONDITION THAT VIOLATES
            EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

12.5  Plugging and Abandonment. In addition to any wells and facilities
      currently in use, the Properties contain wells and facilities that have
      been temporarily or permanently abandoned. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF A
      BREACH OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATION IN ARTICLE 10.1.13 ASSERTED DURING THE
      TERM OF SUCH REPRESENTATION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS
      AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, INCLUDING ARTICLE 8:

            RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND AGREES TO PAY ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES
            ASSOCIATED WITH PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF ALL WELLS,
            DECOMMISSIONING OF ALL FACILITIES, AND CLEARING OF SITES AND

            THE FACT THAT PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT, DECOMMISSIONING, SITE
            CLEARANCE OR SEABED RESTORATION OPERATIONS ARE NOT COMPLETE OR THAT

            ABANDONMENT, DECOMMISSIONING, SITE CLEARANCE OR SEABED RESTORATION
            OPERATIONS AS AN ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OR A BREACH OF
            SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
            BASIS FOR ANY OTHER REDRESS AGAINST SELLER, AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF
            BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
            AND ALL CLAIMS THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH
            THE SAME; AND

      (b)   IF CLOSING OCCURS, BUYER, FROM AND AFTER CLOSING, RELEASES SELLER
            GROUP FROM AND SHALL FULLY PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD
            SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING
            TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
            PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF WELLS, DECOMMISSIONING OF FACILITIES,
            AND CLEARING OF SITES AND RESTORING SEABEDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
            PROPERTIES, NO MATTER WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE
            TIME. THIS INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF
            CAUSE OR OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS (INCLUDING SOLE
            NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF
            DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), VIOLATION OF LAW, OR OTHER FAULT OF
            SELLER GROUP, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT.

12.6  Imbalances. Buyer acknowledges that Imbalances may exist that are
      associated with the Properties and all Imbalances (whether for
      overproduction by Seller or underproduction by Seller) shall pass to Buyer
      as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall thereupon be entitled to all
      rights and obligations with respect to any and all such Imbalances. Except
      as provided below in this Article, there shall be no amounts paid to or
      from either Party to the other as a Purchase Price adjustment, as part of
      the Final Accounting Settlement or otherwise, based on Imbalances. Except

            RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND AGREES TO PAY ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES
            ASSOCIATED WITH IMBALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES, AND BUYER

            IMBALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES, NO MATTER WHETHER ARISING
            BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME. THIS INDEMNITY


                                       35

      Notwithstanding the preceding, the following adjustment shall be made
      between the Parties with respect to Imbalances:

            (i)   If Seller's aggregate production Imbalances on January 1, 2003
                  vary from - 1.0 Bcfe (underproduced) to the detriment of
                  Seller by more than 1.0 Bcfe, then Seller shall pay Buyer the
                  product of $2.00/mcf and the entire amount of such variance
                  (including the first 1.0 Bcfe); or

            (ii)  If Seller's aggregate production Imbalances on January 1, 2003
                  vary from - 1.0 Bcfe (underproduced) to the benefit of Seller
                  by more than 1.0 Bcfe, then Buyer shall pay Seller the product
                  of $2.00/mcf and the entire amount of such variance (including

            BUYER INCLUDE SUCH AMOUNTS AND (II) THAT MAY ACCRUE AFTER CLOSING),
            AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND
            ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST
            SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME; AND

      if Sales Tax is due and owing


                                       36
<PAGE>
      as a result of Seller's or BP America's transfer of the Properties to
      Buyer, Buyer shall be liable for any and all such Sales Tax. Before the
      Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall agree on the value of the tangible
      personal property being transferred and Buyer shall provide Seller with
      documentation detailing the basis for Buyer's allocation of the Purchase
      Price to any Properties that are subject to Sales Tax. Buyer shall provide
      Seller with an exemption certificate for any tangible personal property
      included in the Properties for which it claims a Sales Tax exemption.
      Seller shall invoice, and Buyer shall pay, any Sales Tax on Buyer's
      acquisition of all nonexempt tangible personal property and Seller or BP

      (INCLUDING ARTICLE 8), BUYER RELEASES SELLER GROUP FROM AND SHALL FULLY
      PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST

      THEREON, BUYER SHALL REIMBURSE SELLER WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER
      RECEIPT OF SELLER'S WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE PAYMENT.

      most recent audited annual financial statements and most recent quarterly
      reviewed financial statements (each prepared in accordance with generally
      accepted accounting principles) of at least one billion dollars (US
      $1,000,000,000), Buyer has caused an Affiliate of Buyer, which has a net
      worth of at least one billion dollars (US $1,000,000,000), to execute and
      deliver the Guaranty Agreement simultaneously with the execution of this
      Agreement or, if Buyer has no such Affiliate, Buyer has provided Seller
      with a letter of credit or surety bond from a bank or other financial
      institution having a net worth of at least one billion dollars (US
      $1,000,000,000), in form and substance satisfactory to Seller, in an
      amount sufficient to secure Buyer's performance of all obligations of
      Buyer hereunder, including plugging and abandonment obligations.

      Agreement on the Closing Date.

12.11 Third Party Technology. Third Party proprietary seismic and other
      proprietary technology, including software, is used in connection with
      ownership or operation of the Properties. Notwithstanding anything in this
      Agreement to the contrary, Buyer is responsible for obtaining any
      necessary consents to Seller's (or, if applicable with respect to the BP
      America Properties, BP America's) assignment of any licenses or other
      agreements or for Buyer to enter into new licenses or other agreements as
      may be needed to permit Buyer to continue to utilize any Third Party
      seismic or Third Party technology used on the Properties after the Closing
      Date. Seller shall reasonably assist Buyer in contacting the relevant
      Third Parties, but Buyer shall be solely responsible for and shall


                                       37
<PAGE>
      bear all costs and transfer and other fees required to obtain licenses,
      assignments or new agreements. In the event Buyer acquires any such Third
      Party licenses, then Seller shall provide (or, if applicable, Seller shall
      cause BP America to provide) Buyer with all Transferable Seismic Data with
      respect to such licenses to the extent Seller's (or, if applicable, BP
      America's) licenses permit, with the cost of supplying and copying such
      data borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

12.12 Interim Period.

      (a)   During the Interim Period, Seller shall (or, where applicable,
            Seller shall cause BP America to): (i) maintain and operate the
            Properties and dispose of production from the Properties in the
            ordinary course of business consistent with the Seller's (or BP
            America's, where applicable) past custom and practice with respect
            to the Properties, (ii) to the extent practicable in the
            circumstances, consult with Buyer in relation to any material
            decision in connection with the Properties, provided that nothing in
            this sub-clause shall operate to fetter the discretion of Seller (or
            BP America, where applicable) in acting with respect to the
            Properties except as explicitly provided in this Article 12.12, and
            (iii) generally keep Buyer in a timely manner informed of matters
            (not of a routine or minor nature) relating to the Properties.

      (b)   Without the consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably
            withheld or delayed), during the Interim Period, Seller shall not,
            (or, if applicable with respect to the BP America Properties, Seller
            shall cause BP America not to) with respect to the Properties:

            (i)   except with respect to matters retained by Seller that are
                  referenced in Exhibit "C", waive, compromise or settle any
                  right or claim for an amount in excess of US $250,000 or which
                  may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
                  value of the Properties as a whole in excess of US $250,000;

            (ii)  incur obligations with respect to the Properties for which
                  Buyer would be responsible after Closing, other than
                  transactions (x) not exceeding US $250,000 individually which

            (iii) encumber, sell, lease, remove from the Real Property or

            (iv)  enter into a contract or commitment for capital expenditures
                  or the acquisition or construction of fixed assets for which

                  amount individually in excess of two hundred fifty thousand
                  dollars (US $250,000), except in connection with situations
                  believed in good faith by Seller to constitute an emergency
                  (in which case Seller's obligation is limited to notifying

                  obligations);

            (v)   enter into a contract or agreement with an Affiliate of Seller

                  such contracts on substantially the same terms.

      (c)   Regardless of whether all of the operations conducted by Seller (or,
            if applicable, BP America) during the Interim Period with respect to
            any of the Properties have been fully completed by Seller (or, if
            applicable, BP America) prior to Closing, Buyer shall, upon Closing,
            assume full responsibility for the completion of all such operations
            applicable to the Properties not in violation of this Article 12.12,
            subject, however, to the terms of the Transition Agreement during
            the Transition Period.

      (d)   During the Interim Period, Seller shall use (and, with respect to
            the BP America Properties, Seller shall cause BP America to use) its
            reasonable efforts to obtain all required consents and approvals,
            and all waivers of preferential purchase rights, applicable to the
            transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that Seller

            obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in
            order to obtain the required consents, approvals and waivers. Buyer

            shall be delivered to the following individuals, each of whom shall
            have full authority to grant or deny such requests for approvals:

12.13 Operator Acts. Seller shall not be deemed or held in breach of any of

      this Agreement to the extent that any such breach arises out of the
      actions of Buyer as operator of certain of the Properties.

12.14 Notification of Breaches.  Until the Closing:

      (a)   Seller shall notify Buyer at the time any Schedule or Exhibit is
            delivered pursuant to Article 12.15(a) or Article 12.15(e) of any
            item in such Schedule or Exhibit that to Seller's knowledge is
            inaccurate or missing, and Buyer shall notify Seller following
            Buyer's review, but before the Parties have agreed upon such
            Schedule or Exhibit, of any item in such Schedule or Exhibit that to
            Buyer's knowledge is inaccurate or missing.

      (b)   Buyer shall notify Seller promptly after Buyer obtains actual
            knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
            this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue
            in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant
            or agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on
            the Closing Date has not been so performed or observed in any
            material respect.

      (c)   Seller shall notify Buyer promptly after Seller obtains actual
            knowledge that any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in
            this Agreement is untrue in any


                                       40
<PAGE>
            material respect or will be untrue in any material respect as of the
            Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or
            observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so
            performed or observed in a material respect.

      (d)   If any of Buyer's or Seller's representations or warranties is
            untrue or shall become untrue in any material respect between the
            date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any
            of Buyer's or Seller's covenants or agreements to be performed or
            observed prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so
            performed or observed in any material respect, but if such breach of
            representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable)
            be cured by the Closing, then such breach shall be considered not to
            have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

12.15 Delivery of Certain Information.

      (a)   As soon as practicable and not later than twenty (20) Business Days

            (i)   A list of all preferential rights to purchase affecting the
                  Properties and applicable to the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement not otherwise delivered under Article 12.15(b),
                  and

            (ii)  A list of all filing, registration, permit, authorization,
                  consent or approval requirements in favor of any governmental
                  authority or other Third Party affecting the Properties that
                  must be satisfied for consummation of the transactions
                  contemplated by this Agreement, other than those governmental
                  filings, registrations, permits, authorizations, consents and
                  approvals that are customarily made or obtained post-Closing;

      (d)   As soon as practicable, and not later than ten (10) Business Days
            after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with
            the following information:

<PAGE>
            (i)   A list of all Properties where proceeds from the sale of
                  hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties
                  were held as of the date hereof without Seller's consent by
                  any Third Party after the due date for payment, in suspense
                  accounts or otherwise, and

            (ii)  A list of any capital commitments or agreements of Seller as
                  of the Effective Time which Seller reasonably anticipates will
                  require capital expenditures by the owner of the Properties
                  after the Effective Time individually in excess of US
                  $250,000.

      (e)   As soon as practicable, and not later than January 24, 2003, Seller
            shall deliver to Buyer a replacement for Exhibit "A" containing
            detailed Net Revenue Interest and Working Interest information and
            an Exhibit "A-1." Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of
            the replacement Exhibit "A," Buyer shall deliver to Seller Buyer's
            Allocations. Buyer and Seller shall reach agreement in writing upon
            the form and content of each such Exhibit and Buyer's Allocations,
            consent by each Party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As
            of the date on which Buyer and Seller have agreed in writing upon a
            revised Exhibit "A" and Buyer's Allocations, such Exhibit "A"
            (including Buyers' Allocations) shall replace in its entirety the
            Exhibit "A" attached to this Agreement at signing, and shall be
            deemed to be Exhibit "A" hereto for all purposes. The adjustments
            for Alleged Title Defects and Title Benefits under Article 4.2 and
            Seller's representation and warranty in Article 10.1.6 shall not
            come into force and effect until the date on which Buyer and Seller
            have agreed in writing upon such revised Exhibits and Buyer's
            Allocations.

      (f)   Seller may amend Exhibit "C", the Schedules to this Agreement and,
            once submitted, the lists supplied pursuant to this Article, subject
            to the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
            withheld, provided that Buyer's withholding consent shall be deemed
            reasonable if the amendment would result in a material decrease in
            the value of the Properties or a negative impact on Buyer unless
            Seller has agreed in writing to indemnify Buyer Group from and
            against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action,
            losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties and costs (including
            attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) to the extent relating to,
            arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, the
            subject matter of such amendment, provided that Seller's right to
            indemnify Buyer Group under this Article shall not apply to with
            respect to claims, demands, suits, causes of action, losses,
            damages, liabilities, fines, penalties and costs (including
            attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) that in aggregate can be
            reasonably expected to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
            Purchase Price.

12.16 Financial Audit. Both prior to and after the Closing, Seller shall provide
      Buyer with access to Seller's financial records for the Properties for the
      calendar years 2001 and 2002 which were previously made available to
      Seller's auditors for purposes of preparing Seller's annual audited and
      quarterly reviewed financial statements for those years and to Seller's
      corresponding financial records for any portion of 2003 prior to the
      Closing, including in each case records with respect to direct lease
      operating costs with respect to


                                       42
<PAGE>
      each of the Properties and the gross revenues from such Properties and
      such other information as may be required for Buyer's Form 8-K filing with
      respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall
      cause Seller's and Seller's Affiliates' personnel to cooperate with Buyer
      in providing such access and to reasonably assist Buyer in locating and
      interpreting such records and Seller shall cause Seller's contractor IBM
      to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer in the preparation of certain
      supporting financial schedules and audit work papers. The cost incurred by
      Seller in providing the financial data to Buyer and assisting Buyer shall
      be borne by Buyer. BUYER RELEASES SELLER GROUP FROM AND SHALL FULLY
      PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST
      ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH,
      DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, SELLER'S PREPARATION OR FURNISHING OF ANY SUCH
      RECORDS TO BUYER, ANY ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR CERTIFICATIONS OF
      SELLER'S AND ITS AFFILIATES' PERSONNEL OR AUDITORS WITH RESPECT TO THE
      INFORMATION CONTAINED IN SUCH RECORDS, OR BUYER'S USE OF THE INFORMATION
      CONTAINED IN SUCH FINANCIAL RECORDS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE OR OF ANY
      NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
      NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE),
      VIOLATION OF LAW, OR OTHER FAULT OF SELLER GROUP, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING
      DEFECT.

                               ARTICLE 13. HSR ACT

13.1  HSR Filings. If compliance with the HSR Act is required in connection with
      the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
      and in any event not more than thirty (30) Days after the date of this
      Agreement, both Parties shall file with the Federal Trade Commission and
      the Department of Justice, as applicable, the required notification and
      report forms and shall as promptly as practicable furnish any supplemental
      information that may be requested in connection therewith. Each Party
      shall take all reasonable steps to achieve early termination of applicable
      waiting periods.

                              ARTICLE 14. PERSONNEL

14.1  Employees. Seller has no obligation to provide Buyer an opportunity to
      interview for employment any individuals who support the Properties and
      Buyer has no obligation to hire any such individuals.

14.2  Restriction on Solicitation. Buyer may not (without obtaining the prior
      written consent of Seller), for a period of twelve (12) months after the
      Closing Date, solicit employment of, or contact except for such contact as
      may be necessary in respect to litigation, claims or other business
      matters unrelated to the solicitation of employment, any of Seller's
      employees directly or indirectly engaged in operation of the Properties as
      of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date or engaged in the
      negotiation or Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
      For purposes of this Article 14.2, a general published solicitation or
      advertisement for employment (whether in print or on-line) shall not be a
      breach hereof.

      prohibit consummation of or obtain material damages associated with the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement or sale of any one or more of
      the Properties; nor to the Parties' knowledge are there any pending
      investigations by a governmental entity that would be likely to result in
      any suit, action or other proceedings to restrain, enjoin or otherwise
      prohibit consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
      sale of any one or more of the Properties; provided that if such an
      injunction, order, award, suit, action or other proceeding applicable to
      some (but not all) of the Properties is pending on the Closing Date,
      Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties shall proceed and the
      Parties shall conduct a second closing for the affected Properties if and
      when the above-referenced condition to Closing is removed. If the
      above-referenced condition to Closing is not removed as to the affected
      Properties within one hundred twenty (120) Days after the Closing Date,
      the affected Properties, automatically and without need for amendment of
      this Agreement, shall be removed from this Agreement, and Buyer shall not
      be obligated to make payment to Seller for that portion of the Purchase
      Price allocated to such Properties in Buyer's Allocations, and the Parties
      shall have no further obligations to each other with respect to the same;

      15.3.3 all material consents and approvals (except for consents and
      approvals of governmental entities or authorities customarily obtained
      subsequent to transfer of title) have been obtained; provided, however, if
      on the Closing Date consents applicable to some (but not all) of the
      Properties have not been obtained, Closing with respect to the unaffected
      Properties shall proceed, and the Parties shall conduct a second closing
      for the


                                       45
<PAGE>
      affected Properties if and when the above-referenced condition to Closing
      is removed. If the above-referenced condition to Closing is not removed as
      to the affected Properties within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the
      Closing Date, the affected Properties automatically and without need for
      amendment of this Agreement shall be removed from this Agreement, and
      Buyer shall not be obligated to make payment to Seller for that portion of
      the Purchase Price allocated to such Properties in Buyer's Allocations,
      and the Parties shall have no further obligations to each other with
      respect to the same; and

      15.3.4 (a) preferential purchase rights applicable to the Properties
      either have been exercised and affected Properties excluded from the
      Closing in accordance with Article 3.1, or have been waived; or (b) the
      time to elect under such preferential purchase rights has elapsed. If on
      the Closing Date preferential purchase rights applicable to some (but not
      all) Properties have not been waived, or the time to elect has not
      elapsed, Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties shall proceed,
      and the Parties shall conduct a second closing with respect to the
      affected Properties if and when the above-referenced condition to Closing
      is removed. If the above-referenced condition to the Closing Date is not
      removed as to the affected Properties within one hundred twenty (120) Days
      after the Closing Date, the affected Properties, automatically and without
      need to amend this Agreement, shall be removed from this Agreement and the
      Parties shall have no further obligations to each other with respect to
      the same.

                             ARTICLE 17. TERMINATION

17.1  Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated (except for the
      individual provisions specifically referenced in Article 17.2 below) at
      any time prior to Closing (unless another date is stated below):

      17.1.1 by the Parties' mutual written agreement;

      17.1.2 by either Party, if consummation of the transaction contemplated by
      this Agreement would violate any non-appealable final order, decree or
      judgment of any state or federal court or agency enjoining, restraining,
      prohibiting or awarding substantial damages in connection with (a) the
      proposed sale of Properties to Buyer hereunder, or (b) consummation of the
      transaction contemplated by this Agreement;

      17.1.3 by Seller, if Buyer refuses or fails for any reason to deliver to
      Seller the Performance Deposit in accordance with Article 2.3;

      17.1.4 notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
      contrary, by either Seller or Buyer, if Closing has not occurred on or
      before June 1, 2003 provided the terminating party is not then in breach
      in any material respect of its obligations under Articles 12, 13 and 16;
      or

      17.1.5 by either Seller or Buyer pursuant to Article 7.2.

17.2  Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
      Article 17.1, such termination is without liability to either Party,
      except performance of obligations in this Article 17.2 and Articles 14.2,
      17.3, 17.4, 19.1, 19.3, 19.10, 19.11, 19.12, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15 (all
      of which provisions survive termination of this Agreement), and except as
      provided in the following sentence. If Closing does not occur, Seller
      shall refund the Performance Deposit together with Computed Interest to
      Buyer unless the Closing did not occur because of a failure of Buyer's
      representations and warranties in this Agreement to be true and correct in
      all material respects, Buyer's material breach of a material obligation,
      covenant or condition of this Agreement, Buyer's failure to furnish
      satisfactory evidence pursuant to Section 15.1.3, or Buyer's failure or
      refusal to Close that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, in
      any of which events Buyer shall pay to Seller as Seller's exclusive remedy
      an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price, less the
      Performance Deposit, which Seller shall be entitled to retain together
      with any interest earned thereon as liquidated damages and not a penalty.

17.3  Dispute over Right to Terminate. If there is a dispute between the Parties
      over the termination of or over the right of a Party to terminate this
      Agreement, Closing shall not


                                       49
<PAGE>
      occur on the Closing Date, and the Party that disputes the right of the
      other Party to terminate is entitled, within thirty (30) Days after the
      date on which notice of termination was provided by either Party to the
      other, to initiate litigation to resolve the dispute, unless the Parties
      mutually agree in writing to extend such time. If the Party that disputes
      the other Party's right to terminate this Agreement does not initiate
      litigation within the thirty (30) Day period (as extended in writing, if
      applicable), this Agreement shall be deemed properly terminated as of the
      original date of termination (without prejudice to Seller's right to
      receive liquidated damages, including retention of the Performance Deposit
      together with any interest earned thereon, pursuant to Article 17.2), AND
      THE PARTY THAT DISPUTES OR HAS A RIGHT TO DISPUTE TERMINATION OF THIS
      AGREEMENT, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THE OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF ITSELF AND ITS
      AFFILIATES, IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT AND THEY MAY HAVE
      AGAINST THE TERMINATING PARTY FOR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. In the
      event that there is a dispute between the Parties with regard to the
      termination of or the right to terminate this Agreement and litigation is
      initiated, Buyer may elect to place into an escrow account an amount equal
      to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price, less the Performance Deposit,
      pending the resolution of the litigation. If Buyer so elects, Seller shall
      place into an escrow account an amount equal to the Performance Deposit.

17.4  Confidentiality. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any
      other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the
      Confidentiality Agreement remain in full force and effect, provided that
      if and when Closing occurs and effective on the Closing Date, the
      Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate to the extent (and only to the
      extent) it applies to the Properties conveyed at Closing. The foregoing
      notwithstanding, after Closing: (a) Seller shall continue to comply with
      all current Third Party confidentiality agreements, as applicable, with
      respect to the Records, (b) Seller shall treat the geological, geophysical
      and engineering Records in accordance with the same standards of conduct
      by which Seller treats its own geological, geophysical and engineering
      records, provided that nothing in (b) above shall be construed as
      prohibiting Seller from disclosing the Records or information contained
      therein (i) to an Affiliate, (ii) to a governmental agency or other entity
      when required by Law or to the extent such data and information is
      required to be furnished in compliance with any applicable Laws, or
      pursuant to any legal proceedings or because of any order of any court
      binding upon Seller or Seller's Affiliate, (iii) to prospective or actual
      contractors, consultants and attorneys employed by Seller where disclosure
      of such data or information is essential to such contractor's,
      consultant's or attorney's work, (iv) to co-owners or joint venturers and
      bona fide prospective transferees of Seller's ownership interest in
      properties to which the information relates, (v) to a bank or other
      financial institution in order to arrange for financing, (vi) to the
      extent that it must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of
      any government or stock exchange having jurisdiction over Seller or an
      Affiliate of Seller, and (vii) to the extent it, through no fault of
      Seller, becomes a part of the public domain, provided that, in the cases
      of (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) above, the person to whom such Records or
      information is disclosed shall maintain the confidentiality thereof in
      accordance with Article 17.4.

                             ARTICLE 18. ARBITRATION

18.1  Arbitration. Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through use of binding
      arbitration using three (3) arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial
      Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") as
      in effect on January 11, 2003, as supplemented to the extent necessary to
      determine any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act
      (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any inconsistency between
      this Article and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal
      Arbitration Act, this Article shall control. Arbitration must be initiated
      within the applicable time limits set forth in this Agreement and not
      thereafter or if no time limit is given, within the time period allowed by
      the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration, if initiated, must be
      initiated by a Party ("CLAIMANT") serving written notice on the other
      Party ("RESPONDENT") that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable
      Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant's notice initiating arbitration
      must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall
      respond to Claimant within thirty (30) Days after receipt of Claimant's
      notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If the
      Respondent does not name an arbitrator within the thirty (30) Day period,
      the administrator of the Houston office of the AAA shall provide the
      Parties with a list of potential arbitrators from the National Panel of
      Commercial Arbitrators maintained by the AAA (subject to the qualification
      requirements of this Article 18) and an arbitrator for Respondent's
      account shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in
      Section R-13.b of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The two (2)
      arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30)
      Days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. If the
      Party-appointed arbitrators cannot reach agreement upon the third
      arbitrator within the thirty (30) Day period, the third arbitrator shall
      be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section R-15.c
      of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of AAA, provided that, all potential
      arbitrators shall meet the qualification requirements of this Article 18.
      With respect to arbitrators selected using the procedures set out in
      R-13.b or R-15.c, if any, the AAA shall submit lists to the Parties until
      an arbitrator is selected and shall not have the power to make an
      appointment other than through the exchange of lists. The Parties each
      shall pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators.
      All arbitrators must (a) be neutral persons who have never been officers,
      directors, employees, or consultants or had other business relationships
      with the Parties or any of their Affiliates, officers, directors or
      employees, and (b) have not less than seven (7) years recent experience in
      the U.S. oil and gas industry relevant to the matters in dispute. The
      hearing will be conducted in Houston, Texas, and commence as soon as
      practicable after the selection of the third arbitrator. The Parties and
      the arbitrators should proceed diligently and in good faith so that the
      award can be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the
      Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators shall be binding
      on and non-appealable by the Parties. The arbitrators shall have no right
      or authority to grant or award indirect, consequential, punitive or
      exemplary damages of any kind.

      BUYER RELEASES SELLER FROM AND SHALL FULLY PROTECT, INDEMNIFY AND DEFEND
      SELLER AND HOLD IT HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING
      TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
      COMMISSIONS, FINDERS' FEES OR OTHER REMUNERATION DUE TO ANY AGENT, BROKER
      OR FINDER CLAIMING BY, THROUGH OR UNDER BUYER.

19.4  Records. At Closing, and through the Transition Period, Seller shall grant
      Buyer reasonable access to the Records and shall, to the extent reasonably
      possible, grant Buyer access during normal business hours, to copy the
      Records at Buyer's expense. As soon as practicable, but in no event later
      than sixty (60) Days after the end of the Transition Period (except as
      provided below), Seller shall furnish Buyer Records that are maintained by
      Seller; provided, however, Seller may retain (a) copies of any or all
      Records, (b) originals of any Records associated with litigation or other
      proceedings pending or threatened by or against Seller or Seller Group,
      (c) originals of tax records, (d) originals of any Records in connection
      with the Final Accounting Settlement until payments made thereunder have
      been agreed and paid in full, (e) originals of any Records required in
      connection with any Transition Period activities, and (f) originals of any
      Records associated with any properties not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to
      this Agreement. To the extent Records to be transferred hereunder are not
      needed by Seller during the Transition Period, Seller shall to the extent
      practicable deliver such Records prior to the end of the Transition Period
      as requested by Buyer. If Seller retains originals of Records, other than
      Records described in clause (e) which will be delivered after the
      Transition Period, or Records described in clause (f), Seller shall
      furnish copies thereof to Buyer at Seller's expense (provided that the
      cost of supplying and copying any seismic Records shall be borne one-half
      by Buyer and one-half by Seller). Buyer shall maintain the Records
      received from Seller for ten (10) years after the Closing Date and afford
      Seller full access to the Records and a right to copy the Records at
      Seller's expense as reasonably requested by Seller. If Buyer desires to
      destroy the Records within such ten (10) year period, it shall notify
      Seller prior to such destruction, and provide Seller an opportunity to
      take possession of them at Seller's expense. In addition, Buyer shall
      afford Seller full access to records and data produced after the Closing
      Date and reasonably requested by Seller in connection with any claim by
      Buyer for indemnity or breach of representation and warranty under this
      Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client
      communications entitled to legal privilege), and a right to copy such
      records and data at Seller's expense.

      Seller shall afford Buyer full access to records and data produced after
      the Closing Date and reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with any
      claim by Seller for indemnity or breach of representation and warranty
      under this Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and
      attorney-client communications entitled to legal privilege), and a right
      to copy such records and data at Buyer's expense.

      Disclosure or transfer of the Records to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
      is not intended to waive legal privilege for any privileged documents that
      may be included among the Records. Should Seller determine after the
      disclosure or transfer of any Records that such Records are entitled to
      legal privilege, including attorney work product and


                                       53
<PAGE>
      attorney-client communications, and should Seller notify Buyer to that
      effect, Buyer agrees to use all reasonable efforts to preserve the
      privilege to which such materials are or may be entitled, including
      segregation and/or return of such materials, execution of a joint defense
      agreement, or any other reasonable arrangement, and shall cooperate with
      and provide reasonable assistance to Seller in Seller's efforts to
      preserve such privilege.

19.5  Further Assurances. After Closing and on an on-going basis: (a) Buyer
      shall execute and deliver or use reasonable efforts to cause to be
      executed and delivered any other instruments of conveyance and take any
      other actions as Seller reasonably requests to more effectively put Seller
      in possession of any property that was not intended by the Parties to have
      been conveyed or was conveyed in error (including reassignment from Buyer
      to Seller of any Properties that were conveyed in violation of valid
      preferential purchase rights or consents to assignment), or to implement
      Buyer's assumption of obligations pursuant to Article 12.3; and (b) Seller
      shall execute and deliver or use reasonable efforts to cause to be
      executed and delivered any other instruments of conveyance and take any
      other actions as Buyer reasonably requests to more effectively put Buyer
      in possession of the Properties conveyed or to have been conveyed in
      accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In particular, Seller and
      Buyer agree to execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
      actions as may be necessary and advisable to: (i) make all filings,
      registrations, and recordings which must be made with respect to the
      Properties in the records of the MMS in order that the records maintained
      by the MMS shall accurately reflect the transfer of the Properties from
      Seller to Buyer, (ii) enable Seller to promptly take all reasonable
      actions within Seller's control to allow Buyer to be designated as
      operator with respect to the Properties, of which Seller is the sole owner
      and to recommend that Buyer be designated as operator with respect to the
      other Properties of which Seller is currently operator; and (iii) obtain
      prompt and unconditional MMS approvals of transfer of the Properties. To
      the extent the MMS requires, Buyer agrees to promptly take any and all
      action necessary to post with the MMS any supplemental bonds and provide
      any and all documentation that the MMS requires, to evidence Buyer's
      financial responsibility under applicable federal regulations and MMS
      policies.

19.6  Survival of Certain Obligations. Representations and warranties in Article
      10 of this Agreement terminate one (1) year after the Closing Date; and
      thereafter no action can be commenced either in court or disputes brought
      to arbitration based on breach of those representations and warranties,
      without prejudice to the right to recovery in connection with actions or
      disputes commenced in the appropriate forum prior to the end of the
      one-year period. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement,
      waivers, disclaimers, releases and obligations of indemnity and defense
      contained in this Agreement survive the Closing indefinitely.

19.7  Amendments and Severability. No amendments, waivers or other modifications
      of terms of this Agreement shall be effective or binding on the Parties
      unless they are written and signed by both Parties. Invalidity of any
      provisions in this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this
      Agreement as a whole, and in case of such invalidity, this Agreement shall
      be construed as if the invalid provision had not been included herein.

      Seller may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any one or more
      of Seller's Affiliates without Buyer's consent, and may freely assign its
