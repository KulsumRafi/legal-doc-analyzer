Improvements being constructed in Suite 100, including, without limitation, any
rerouting, rebalancing, the addition or removal of supply or return vents or
other adjustments to the system required to accommodate the Tenant Improvements
for Suite 100 being completed pursuant to the Work Letter attached to this
Amendment.

      F.    Contingency. Tenant understands and agrees that the effectiveness of
this Amendment is contingent upon the mutual execution of a lease surrender and
termination agreement for Suite 100 by Landlord and AST Research, Inc., the
current tenant in possession of Suite 100. If the contingency contained in this
Section III(F) is not fully satisfied on or before December 17, 1999, then
either party may terminate this Amendment by giving written notice to the other
at any time thereafter (but prior to Landlord's notice of full satisfaction of
this contingency), and Tenant shall thereupon be free to proceed under the
provisions contained in Section 2.6 of the Lease.

IV.   GENERAL.

      A.    Effect of Amendments. The Lease shall remain in full force and
effect except to the extent that it is modified by this Amendment.

      B.    Entire Agreement. This Amendment embodies the entire understanding
between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the modifications set forth in "III.
MODIFICATIONS" above and can be changed only by a writing signed by Landlord and
Tenant.

      C.    Counterparts. If this Amendment is executed in counterparts, each is
hereby declared to be an original; all, however, shall constitute but one and
the same amendment. In any action or proceeding, any photographic, photostatic,
or other copy of this Amendment may be introduced into evidence without
foundation.

      D.    Defined Terms. All words commencing with initial capital letters in
this Amendment and defined in the Lease shall have the same meaning in this
Amendment as in the Lease, unless they are otherwise defined in this Amendment.

      E.    Corporate and Partnership Authority. If Tenant is a corporation or
partnership, or is comprised of either or both of them, each individual
executing this Amendment for the corporation or partnership represents that he
or she is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Amendment on behalf of the
corporation or partnership and that this Amendment is binding upon the
corporation or partnership in accordance with its terms.

      F.    Attorneys' Fees. The provisions of the Lease respecting payment of
attorneys' fees shall also apply to this Amendment.

V.    EXECUTION.
