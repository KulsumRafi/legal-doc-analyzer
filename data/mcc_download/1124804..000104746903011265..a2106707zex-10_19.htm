representative within twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the date of death of such Participant or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option, notwithstanding that the decedent might

date (other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday) not less than five (5)&nbsp;nor more than ten (10)&nbsp;days after the date of such written notice, as the date on which the Shares will be
purchased. Such tender and conveyance shall take place at the principal office of the Company during ordinary business hours, or at such other hour and place agreed upon by the Company and the person
or persons exercising the Option. On the date specified in such written notice (which date may be extended by the Company in order to comply with any law or regulation which requires the Company to
take any action with respect to the Option Shares prior to the issuance thereof, whether pursuant to the provisions of Article&nbsp;VI or otherwise), the Company shall accept payment for the Option
Shares and shall deliver to the person or persons exercising the Option in exchange therefor an appropriate certificate or certificates for paid non-assessable Shares. In the event of any
failure to take up and pay for the number of Shares specified in such written notice on the date set forth therein (or on the extended date as above provided), the right to exercise the Option shall
terminate with respect to such number of Shares, but shall continue with respect to the remaining Shares covered by the Option and not yet acquired pursuant thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the timing of the exercise provisions of any Option in the event of (i)&nbsp;the
adoption of a plan of merger or consolidation under which all the Shares of the Company would be eliminated, or (ii)&nbsp;a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or Shares.
Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion, cancel any or all Options upon any of the foregoing events and provide for the payment to Participants in cash of an amount equal to the
difference between the Option price and the price of a Share, as determined in good faith by the Committee, at the close of business on the date of such event, multiplied by the number of Shares
subject to Option so canceled. The preceding two sentences of this Article&nbsp;VI notwithstanding, the Company shall be required to accelerate the timing of the exercise provisions of any Option if
(i)&nbsp;any such business combination is to be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests under APB Opinion 16 (or any successor opinion) and (ii)&nbsp;the timing of such
acceleration does not prevent such pooling-of-interests treatment; provided, moreover, that if any provision of the Plan or Option Agreement would disqualify the combination
from pooling-of-interests accounting treatment, then the Plan and Option Agreement shall be interpreted to preserve such accounting treatment or, if necessary, the applicable
provision shall be null and void. All determinations to be made in connection with the preceding sentence shall be made by the independent accounting firm whose opinion with respect to the
pooling-of-interests treatment is required as a condition to the Company's consummation of such combination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
a business combination by the Company or any of its Affiliates with any corporation or other entity through the adoption of a plan of merger or consolidation or a share exchange or
through the purchase of all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of such other corporation or entity, the Board or the Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Options pursuant
hereto to all or any persons who, on the effective date of such transaction, hold outstanding options to purchase securities of such other corporation or entity and who, on and after the effective
date of such transaction, will become employees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company or its Affiliates. The number of Shares subject to such substitute Options shall be determined in
accordance with the terms of the transaction by which the business combination is effected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, the other terms of such substitute Options shall be
substantially the same as or economically equivalent to the terms of the options for which such Options are substituted, all as determined by the Board or by the Committee, as the case may be. Upon
the grant of substitute Options pursuant hereto, the options to purchase securities of such other corporation or entity for which such Options are substituted shall be canceled immediately. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company other than in connection with a transaction to which the preceding Article&nbsp;VI is applicable, all Options
granted hereunder shall terminate and become null and void; provided, however, that if the rights of a Participant under the applicable Options have not otherwise terminated and expired, the
Participant shall have the right immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation to exercise any Option granted hereunder to the extent that the right to purchase Shares thereunder has become
exercisable as of the date immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMINATION OF THE PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall terminate ten (10)&nbsp;years from the date of its adoption. The Plan may be terminated at an earlier date by vote of the Board; provided,
however, that any such earlier termination shall not affect any Options granted or Option Agreements executed prior to the effective date of such termination. Except as may otherwise be provided for
under Articles VI and VII, and notwithstanding the termination of the Plan, any Options granted prior to the effective date of the Plan's termination may be exercised until the earlier of
(i)&nbsp;the date set forth in the Option Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;ten </FONT></P>

to the approval of the stockholders of the Company at or before the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company if such stockholder approval is required by the Code, any federal or state
law or regulation, the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares may be listed or quoted, or if the Board, in its discretion, determines to submit such changes to
the Plan to its stockholders for approval. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as directors or members of the Committee, the members of the Committee shall be indemnified
by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any
appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken by them as members of the Committee and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such
settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to
which it shall be adjudged in such action,
suit or proceeding that the Committee member is liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his or her duties. To receive such indemnification, a Committee member must
first offer in writing to the Company the opportunity, at its own expense, to defend any such action, suit or proceeding. </FONT></P>

accruing to a Participant under this Plan (without the application of this Article&nbsp;XII), either alone or together with other payments or rights accruing to the Participant from the Company or
an Affiliate ("Total Payments") would constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code and regulations thereunder), such payment or right shall be reduced to the largest
amount or greatest right that will result in no portion of the amount payable or right accruing under the Plan being subject to an excise tax under Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or being disallowed
as a deduction under Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. The determination of whether any reduction in the rights or payments under this Plan is to apply shall be made by the Company. The Participant
shall cooperate in good faith with the Company in making such determination and providing any necessary information for this purpose. </FONT></P>
