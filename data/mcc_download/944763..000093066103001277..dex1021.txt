30, 2002 (the "Amendment Date"), is among ENCORE MEDICAL CORPORATION, ENCORE
MEDICAL GP, INC., ENCORE MEDICAL ASSET CORPORATION, ENCORE MEDICAL, L.P., and
BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (in its capacity as administrative agent
under the Credit Agreement referenced below and as the sole Lender under the
Credit Agreement referenced below).

                                    RECITALS:

     A. The Borrowers, the Agent, and the Lenders have entered into that certain
Credit Agreement dated as of February 8, 2002 (as amended by that certain Waiver
and First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of May 7, 2002, the "Credit
Agreement"). The Borrowers have requested that certain provisions of the Credit
Agreement be amended in certain respects.

     B. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, Agent and
the Lenders are willing to amend the Credit Agreement as specifically provided
herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises herein contained and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   Definitions

     Section 1.1 Section Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment,
to the extent not otherwise defined herein, shall have the same meanings as in
the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   Amendments

     Section 2.1 Section Amendment to Section 1.2(a) of the Credit Agreement.
Effective as of the Amendment Date, Section 1.2(a) of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

          (a) Amounts. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
     set forth in Article 8, each Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees,
     upon a Borrower's request from time to time on any Business Day during the
     period from the Closing Date to the Termination Date, to make revolving
     loans (the

<PAGE>

     "Revolving Loans") to the Borrowers (including Revolving Loans that qualify
     as Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans under the Ex-Im Bank Borrower Agreement) in
     amounts not to exceed such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Availability,
     except for Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances and as otherwise set forth
     herein with respect to Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans. The Lenders, however,
     in their unanimous discretion, may elect to make Revolving Loans or issue
     or arrange to have issued Letters of Credit or Credit Support in excess of
     the Availability or the Borrowing Base on one or more occasions (provided
     that any such advance of an Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan may not exceed the
     limitations specified in Section 1.2(k) or in the definition of
     Export-Related Borrowing Base contained in the Ex-Im Bank Borrower
     Agreement), but if they do so, neither the Agent nor the Lenders shall be
     deemed thereby to have changed the limits of the Availability or the
     Borrowing Base or to be obligated to exceed such limits on any other
     occasion. If the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings would exceed the Borrowing
     Base after giving effect to any Borrowing, the Lenders may refuse to make
     or may otherwise restrict the making of Revolving Loans and the issuance of
     Letters of Credit and Credit Support as the Lenders determine until such
     excess has been eliminated, subject to the Agent's authority, in its sole
     discretion, to make Agent Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 1.2(j).

     Section 2.2 Section Amendment to Section 1.2(b) of the Credit Agreement.
Effective as of the Amendment Date, Section 1.2(b) of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

          (b) Revolving Loan Notes. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to
     each Lender a promissory note to evidence the Revolving Loans other than
     the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans of that Lender (each a "Revolving Loan
     Note" and, collectively, the "Revolving Loan Notes"). Each Revolving Loan
     Note shall be in the principal amount of the applicable Lender's Pro Rata
     Share of the Revolving Loan Commitments, dated as of the Closing Date or
     the date of any assignment of a portion of any Lender's Revolving Loans,
     and substantially in the form of Exhibit A. Each Revolving Loan Note shall
     represent the obligation of the Borrowers to pay the amount of the
     applicable Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan Commitments, or,
     if less, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate unpaid principal
     amount of all Revolving Loans other than the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans to
     the Borrowers together with interest thereon as prescribed in this
     Agreement. The entire unpaid balance of the Revolving Loans other than the
     Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans and all other non-contingent Obligations shall
     be immediately due and payable in full in immediately available funds on
     the Termination Date.

     Section 2.3 Amendment to Section 1.2(g) of the Credit Agreement. Effective
as of the Amendment Date, Section 1.2(g) of the Credit Agreement is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

     1.2(i), promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic

<PAGE>

     notice in lieu thereof) other than a request for LIBOR Rate Revolving
     Loans, the Agent shall elect in its discretion to have the terms of Section
     1.2(h), Section 1.2(i), Section 1.2(j), or Section 1.2(k) apply to such
     requested Borrowing. If the Bank declines in its sole discretion to make a
     Non-Ratable Loan pursuant to Section 1.2(i), an Agent Advance pursuant to
     Section 1.2(j), or an Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan pursuant to Section
     1.2(k), the terms of Section 1.2(h) shall apply to the requested Borrowing.

     Section 2.4 Amendment to Section 1.2(h) of the Credit Agreement. Effective
as of the Amendment Date, the first sentence of Section 1.2(h) of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

     If the Agent elects to have the terms of this Section 1.2(h) apply to a
     requested Borrowing or if the requested Borrowing is for a LIBOR Rate
     Revolving Loan, then promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing or
     telephonic notice in lieu thereof, the Agent shall notify the Lenders by
     telecopy, telephone, or e-mail of the requested Borrowing.

     Section 2.5 Amendment to Section 1.2(j) of the Credit Agreement. Effective

     Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Agent is authorized by the
     Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole
     discretion, (i) after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or
     (ii) at any time that any of the other conditions precedent set forth in
     Article 8 have not been satisfied, to make Base Rate Revolving Loans other
     than Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans to the Borrowers or any of them on behalf
     of the Lenders, in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to
     exceed $2,500,000, which the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment,
     deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or
     any portion thereof, (B) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the
     amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (C) to pay any
     other amount chargeable to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement, including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 13.7
     (any of such advances are herein referred to as "Agent Advances"); provided
     that the Majority Lenders may at any time revoke the Agent's authorization
     to make Agent Advances.

     Section 2.6 Addition of Section 1.2(k) to the Credit Agreement. Effective
as of the Amendment Date, the Section 1.2 of the Credit Agreement is hereby

<PAGE>

          (k) Making of Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans.

               (i) Subject to Section 1.2(g), if the Agent elects, with the
          consent of the Bank, to have the terms of this Section 1.2(k) apply,
          to a requested Borrowing and if the requested Borrowing qualifies as
          an Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan, the Bank shall make a Revolving Loan in
          the amount of such requested Borrowing available to the Borrowers on
          the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to the
          Designated Account. Each Revolving Loan made solely by the Bank
          pursuant to this Section 1.2(k) is referred to as an "Ex-Im Bank
          Guaranteed Loan" and such Revolving Loans are collectively referred to
          as the "Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans". Each Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan
          shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to other
          Revolving Loans except to the extent of the provisions of the Ex-Im
          Bank Borrower Agreement, which shall control in the event of any
          inconsistency.

               (ii) The aggregate amount of Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans
          outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (A) $1,500,000
          or (B) the Export-Related Borrowing Base. The Agent shall not request
          the Bank to make any Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan if (Y) the Agent has
          received written notice from any Lender that one or more of the
          applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 will not be
          satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing,
          or (Z) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Export-Related
          Availability on that Funding Date.

               (iii) The Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans shall be secured by the
          Agent's Liens in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Base Rate
          Revolving Loans and Obligations hereunder and shall be guaranteed by
          the Ex-Im Bank to the extent provided in the Ex-Im Bank Master
          Guarantee Agreement.

               (iv) The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to each Lender a
          promissory note to evidence the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans of that
          Lender (each an "Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan Note" and, collectively,
          the "Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan Notes"). Each Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed
          Loan Note shall be in the stated principal amount of the applicable
          Lender's Pro Rata Share of $1,500,000 (except that such note payable
          to the Bank as a Lender shall be in the stated principal amount of
          $1,500,000 and shall be assignable to the Ex-Im Bank), dated as of the
          Closing Date or the date of any assignment of a portion of any
          Lender's Revolving Loans, and substantially in the form of Exhibit I.
          Each Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan Note represents the obligation of the
          Borrowers to pay the amount of the applicable Lender's Pro Rata Share
          of the unpaid principal balance of the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans
          together with interest thereon as prescribed in this Agreement. The
          entire unpaid

<PAGE>

          balance of the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans shall be immediately due
          and payable in full in immediately available funds on the Termination
          Date.

     Subfacility at such time; (ii) the maximum undrawn amount of the requested

          (a) Each Lender's funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by
     the Lenders to be equal at all times to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     outstanding Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding such agreement, the Agent, the
     Bank, and the Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit
     of or enforceable by the Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the
     administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement
     among them as to the Revolving Loans, including the Non-Ratable Loans, the
     Agent Advances, and the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans shall take place on a
     periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:

               (i) The Agent shall request settlement (a "Settlement") with the
          Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis at the
          Agent's election, (A) on behalf of the Bank, with respect to each
          outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, (B) for itself, with respect to each
          Agent Advance, (C) on behalf of the Bank, with respect to each
          outstanding Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan, and (D) with respect to
          collections received, in each case, by notifying the Lenders of such
          requested Settlement by telecopy, telephone, e-mail, or other similar
          form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than
          12:00 noon (Pasadena, California time) on the date of such requested
          Settlement (the "Settlement Date"). Each Lender (other than the Bank,
          in the case of the Non-Ratable Loans and the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed
          Loans, and the Agent, in the case of the Agent Advances) shall
          transfer the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding
          principal amount of the Non-Ratable Loans, the Agent Advances, and the
          Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans with respect to which Settlement is
          requested to the Agent, to such account of the Agent as the Agent may
          designate, not later than 2:00 p.m. (Pasadena, California time), on
          the Settlement Date applicable thereto. Settlements may occur during
          the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default and whether or
          not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 have
          then been satisfied. Such amounts transferred to the Agent shall be
          applied against the amounts of the applicable Non-Ratable Loans, Agent
          Advances, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans and, together with the
          portion of such the Non-Ratable Loans, Agent Advances, or Ex-Im Bank
          Guaranteed Loans representing the Bank's Pro Rata Share thereof, shall
          constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders, respectively. If any such
          amount is not transferred to the Agent by any Lender on the Settlement
          Date applicable thereto, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such
          amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at
          the Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days from and after the
          Settlement Date and thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to
          the Base Rate Revolving Loans (Y) on behalf of the Bank, with respect
          to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan

<PAGE>

          and Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan, and (Z) for itself, with respect to
          each Agent Advance.

               (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than one (1)
          Business Day after demand is made by the Agent (whether before or
          after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default and
          regardless of whether the Agent has requested a Settlement with
          respect to a Non-Ratable Loan, Agent Advance, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed
          Loan), each other Lender (A) shall irrevocably and unconditionally
          purchase and receive from the Bank or the Agent, as applicable,
          without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation
          in such Non-Ratable Loan, Agent Advance, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan
          equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loan, Agent
          Advance, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan and (B) if Settlement has not
          previously occurred with respect to such Non-Ratable Loans, Agent
          Advances, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans, upon demand by the Bank or
          the Agent, as applicable, shall pay to the Bank or the Agent, as
          applicable, as the purchase price of such participation an amount
          equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
          such Non-Ratable Loans, Agent Advances, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed
          Loans. If such amount is not in fact transferred to the Agent by any
          Lender, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand
          from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds
          Rate for the first three (3) days from and after such demand and
          thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to Base Rate Revolving
          Loans.

               (iii) From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender
          purchases an undivided interest and participation in any Non-Ratable
          Loan, Agent Advance, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan pursuant to clause
          (ii) preceding, the Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender,
          such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments of principal and interest
          and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Agent in respect of
          such Non-Ratable Loan, Agent Advance, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan.

               (iv) Between Settlement Dates, to the extent no Agent Advances
          are outstanding, the Agent may pay over to the Bank any payments
          received by the Agent, which in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans,
          for application to the Bank's Revolving Loans including Non-Ratable
          Loans and Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date,
          collections received since the then immediately preceding Settlement
          Date have been applied to the Bank's Revolving Loans (other than to
          Non-Ratable Loans, Agent Advances, or Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans in
          which a Lender has not yet funded its purchase of a participation
          pursuant to clause (ii) preceding), as provided for in the previous
          sentence, the Bank shall pay to the Agent for the accounts of the
          Lenders, to be applied

<PAGE>

          to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such
          that each Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such
          Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the
          period between Settlement Dates, the Bank with respect to Non-Ratable
          Loans and Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans, the Agent with respect to Agent
          Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other
          than Non-Ratable Loans, Agent Advances, and Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed
          Loans, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates
          payable under this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of
          funds employed by the Bank, the Agent, and the other Lenders.

               (v) Unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender to
          the contrary, the Agent may assume that the applicable conditions
          precedent set forth in Article 8 have been satisfied and the requested
          Borrowing will not exceed the Availability and the Export
          Related-Availability, if applicable on any Funding Date for a
          Revolving Loan.

                     FORM OF EX-IM BANK GUARANTEED LOAN NOTE

<PAGE>

                         EX-IM BANK GUARANTEED LOAN NOTE

$____________                                                 ____________, 2002

     EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED (collectively, the "Borrowers"), for value
received, jointly and severally, hereby promises to pay to the order of
_____________________________, a ______________ with an office located at
__________________________ (the "Payee"), the principal amount of
____________________ DOLLARS ($__________) or such lesser amount as may from
time to time be advanced and remain unpaid and outstanding hereunder, together
with accrued interest thereon as provided hereinbelow.

     This Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loan Note ("Note") is executed and delivered by
the Borrowers pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of February 8,
2002 (as such agreement has been and may further be amended, restated, or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among the
Borrowers, each of the financial institutions from time to time party thereto
(the "Lenders"), and Bank of America, National Association, in its capacity as
administrative agent for the Lenders (the "Agent"), and is an "Ex-Im Bank
Guaranteed Loan Note" as defined therein. All terms defined in the Credit
Agreement, wherever used herein, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have the
same meanings herein as are prescribed by the Credit Agreement.

     All Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans from time to time requested by any
Borrower, and from time to time made and outstanding hereunder, are subject in
all respects to the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement. Reference
hereby is made to the Credit Agreement for a statement of the obligations of the
Borrowers and the rights of the Payee in relation thereto, provided that nothing
shall impair the absolute and unconditional, joint and several, obligation of
the Borrowers to pay the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest on
this Note when due. The Credit Agreement, among other things, contains
provisions for acceleration of the maturity of this Note upon the happening of
certain stated events and for prepayments of the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans
prior to the maturity of this Note upon the terms and conditions specified in
the Credit Agreement.

     The unpaid principal from day to day outstanding under this Note shall bear
interest at the applicable rates prescribed for the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans
as provided by the Credit Agreement. The Agent's and the Payee's books and
records shall be prima facie evidence of Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans, interest
accruals, and payments hereunder, absent manifest error.

     The Borrowers unconditionally, jointly and severally, promise to pay all
principal of and accrued interest on the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans from time
to time outstanding under this Note as prescribed by the Credit Agreement and in
any event on the earlier of (a) one hundred eighty days after each advance was
made or (b) the date that any of the Borrowers payment from the account debtor
against the corresponding Eligible Foreign Account. This Note shall
automatically mature and become due and payable in full on the Termination Date.

<PAGE>

     All rights and remedies of the Payee, and of the Agent for the benefit of
the Payee, with respect to the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans evidenced by this
Note (including, without limitation, the right upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default to accelerate the entire unpaid principal balance and unpaid accrued
interest hereunder to be immediately due and payable) as provided by the Credit
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. All obligations and indebtedness
from time to time evidenced by this Note are secured by the Agent's Lien as
provided by the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     No delay or omission by the Agent or the Payee in exercising any power,
right, or remedy hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall
operate as a waiver or impair any such powers, rights, or remedies. Except as
specifically provided in the Credit Agreement, each of the Borrowers and each
other party ever liable hereunder severally hereby expressly waives presentment,
demand, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, protest,
notice of protest, and any other notice of any kind, and agrees that its joint
and several liability hereunder shall not be affected by any renewals,
extensions, or modifications, from time to time, of the time or manner of
payment hereof, or by any release or modification of any Collateral or other
Person liable for the Obligations.

     The Borrowers hereby, jointly and severally, promise to pay to the Agent,
for the benefit of the Agent and the Payee, all reasonable fees, costs, and
expenses incurred by the Agent or the Payee in enforcement and collection of any
amounts under this Note, including, without limitation, Attorney Costs.

     Each of the Agent, the Payee, and the Borrowers acknowledge, agree, and
declare that it is its intention to expressly comply with all Requirements of
Law in respect of limitations on the amount or rate of interest that can legally
be contracted for, charged, or received under or in connection with this Note.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no contingency or
event whatsoever shall the amount of interest (including the aggregate of all
charges, fees, benefits, or other compensation which constitutes interest under
any Requirement of Law) provided for hereunder, paid by any Borrower, received
by the Agent or the Payee, agreed to be paid by any Borrower, or requested or
demanded to be paid by the Agent or the Payee, exceed the Maximum Rate, and all
provisions herein in respect of the contracting for, charging, or receiving
compensation for the use, forbearance, or detention of money shall be limited as
provided in the Credit Agreement and herein. In the event any such interest is
paid to the Agent or the Payee by the Borrowers, or any Borrower, in an amount
or at a rate which would exceed the Maximum Rate, the Agent or the Payee, as the
case may be, shall automatically apply such excess to any unpaid amount of the
Obligations other than interest, in the inverse order of maturity, or if the
amount of such excess exceeds said unpaid amount, such excess shall be paid to
the paying Borrowers or Borrower, as applicable. All interest paid, or agreed to
be paid, by any Borrower, or taken, reserved, or received by the Agent or the
Payee, shall be amortized, prorated, spread, and allocated in respect of the
Obligations throughout the full term of this Note. Notwithstanding any provision
contained in this Note, neither the Agent nor the Payee shall ever be entitled
to charge, receive, take, reserve, collect, or apply as interest any amount
which, together with all other interest under this Note would result in a rate
of interest under this Note in excess of the Maximum Rate and, in the event the
Agent or the Payee ever charges, receives, takes, reserves, collects, or applies
any amount in respect of the Borrowers, or any of them, that otherwise would,
together with all other interest under this Note,

<PAGE>

be in excess of the Maximum Rate, such amount shall automatically be deemed to
be applied in reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Obligations and,
if such principal balance is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith
be paid to the applicable Borrower or Borrowers. The Borrowers, the Agent and
the Payee shall, to the maximum extent permitted under any Requirement of Law,
(a) characterize any non-principal payment as a standby fee, commitment fee,
prepayment charge, delinquency charge, expense, or reimbursement for a
third-party expense rather than as interest and (b) exclude prepayments,
acceleration, and the effects thereof. Nothing in this Note shall be construed
or so operate as to require or obligate the Borrowers, or any of them, to pay
any interest, fees, costs, or charges greater than is permitted by any
Requirement of Law. Subject to the foregoing, the Borrowers hereby agree that
the actual effective rate of interest from time to time existing with respect to
the Ex-Im Bank Guaranteed Loans made by the Payee to the Borrowers, including
all amounts agreed to by the Borrowers or charged or received by the Agent or
the Payee hereunder, which may be deemed to be interest under any Requirement of
Law, shall be deemed to be a rate which is agreed to and stipulated by the
Borrowers and the Payee in accordance with Requirements of Law.

     This Note may not be amended, restated, or otherwise modified except in
writing executed by the Payee and the Borrowers in the manner prescribed by the
Credit Agreement.

     THIS NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS, PROVIDED THAT TO THE EXTENT FEDERAL LAW WOULD ALLOW A HIGHER
RATE OF INTEREST THAN WOULD BE ALLOWED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, THEN
WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW WHICH PURPORTS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF
INTEREST THAT MAY BE CONTRACTED FOR, CHARGED, OR RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS NOTE, SUCH FEDERAL LAW SHALL APPLY.

     This Note shall be binding upon the Borrowers and the Borrowers' successors
and assigns.

     This Note may be assigned to the Export-Import Bank of the United States
pursuant to clause (g) of Section 11.2 of the Credit Agreement.

          THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
     PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS,
     OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL
     AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
