<B>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Condition of Leased Property</U>. </B> Tenant acknowledges receipt and delivery of possession of the Leased Property and Tenant accepts the Leased Property in its &#147;as is&#148; condition, subject to the rights of parties in possession, the existing state of title, including all covenants, conditions, restrictions, reservations, mineral leases, easements and other matters of record or that are visible or apparent on the Leased Property, all applicable Legal Requirements, the lien of any financing instruments, mortgages and deeds of trust existing prior to the Commencement Date or permitted by the terms of this Agreement, and such other matters which would be disclosed by an inspection of the Leased Property and the record title thereto or by an accurate survey thereof.  TENANT REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS INSPECTED THE LEASED PROPERTY AND ALL OF THE FOREGOING AND HAS FOUND THE CONDITION THEREOF SATISFACTORY AND IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF LANDLORD OR LANDLORD'S AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT THERETO AND TENANT WAIVES ANY CLAIM OR ACTION AGAINST LANDLORD IN RESPECT OF THE CONDITION OF THE LEASED PROPERTY.  LANDLORD MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RESPECT OF THE LEASED PROPERTY OR ANY PART THEREOF, EITHER AS TO ITS FITNESS FOR USE, DESIGN OR CONDITION FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP THEREIN, LATENT OR PATENT, IT BEING AGREED THAT ALL SUCH RISKS ARE TO BE BORNE BY TENANT.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, however, Landlord hereby assigns to Tenant all of Landlord's rights to proceed against any predecessor in interest or insurer for breaches of warranties or representations or for latent defects in the Leased Property.  Landlord shall fully cooperate with Tenant in the prosecution of any such claims, in Landlord's or Tenant's name, all at Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from and against any loss, cost, damage or liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Landlord in connection with such cooperation.<br><br>


<B>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fixed Term</U>. </B> The initial term of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Fixed Term</U>&#148;) shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall expire on December 31, 2017.<br><br>


<B>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Extended Terms</U>. </B> Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall have the right to extend the Term for two (2) consecutive renewal terms of fifteen (15) years each (collectively, the &#147;<U>Extended Terms</U>&#148;).<br><br>

Each Extended Term shall commence on the day succeeding the expiration of the Fixed Term or the preceding Extended Term, as the case may be.  All of the terms, covenants and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each such Extended Term, except that Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term beyond the expiration of the Extended Terms.  If Tenant shall elect to exercise the aforesaid options, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice thereof not later than twelve (12) months prior to the scheduled expiration of the then current Term, it being understood and agreed that time shall be of the essence with respect to the giving of such Notice.  If Tenant shall fail to give such Notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the preceding Extended Term, as the case may be, and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.  If Tenant shall give such Notice, the extension of this Agreement shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional documents; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant and Landlord shall execute such documents and agreements as either party shall reasonably require to evidence the same.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing sentence, if, subsequent to the giving of such Notice, an Event of Default shall occur, at Landlord's option, the extension of this Agreement shall cease to take effect and this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the preceding Extended Term, as the case may be, and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.<br>

<DIR><DIR>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Amount</U>. </B> Tenant shall pay additional rent (&#147;<U>Additional Rent</U>&#148;) with respect to each Lease Year during the Term subsequent to the Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount, not less than zero, equal to ten percent (10%) of Excess Net Resident Revenues with respect to such Property.  During the first Lease Year following the Base Year, Tenant shall reasonably estimate the amount of Additional Rent.  For each Lease Year thereafter, monthly payments of Additional Rent for each Property shall be calculated by Tenant using Net Resident Revenues for such month during the preceding Lease Year.  Additional Rent shall be due and payable and delivered to Landlord as provided in <U>Section 3.1.2(b)</U> and shall be reconciled on an annual basis as provided in <U>Section 3.1.2(c)</U>.<br><br>


(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Accounting Period Installments</U>. </B> Installments of Additional Rent for each Lease Year during the Term, or portion thereof, shall be calculated and paid monthly in arrears, together with an Officer's Certificate setting forth the calculation of Additional Rent due and payable for such month. <br><br>


(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Reconciliation of Additional Rent</U>. </B> In addition, within ninety (90) days after the end of the Base Year and each Lease Year thereafter (or any portion thereof occurring during the Term), Tenant shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Landlord (i) a financial report setting forth the Net Resident Revenues for each Property for such preceding Lease Year, or portion thereof, together with an Officer's Certificate from Tenant's chief financial or accounting officer certifying that such report is true and correct and (ii) for all Lease Years other than the Base Year, a statement showing Tenant's calculation of Additional Rent due for such preceding Lease Year based on the Net Resident Revenues set forth in such financial report, together with an Officer's Certificate from Tenant's chief financial or accounting officer certifying that such statement is true and correct.<br><br>


If the annual Additional Rent for such preceding Lease Year as set forth in Tenant's statement thereof exceeds the amount previously paid with respect thereto by Tenant, Tenant shall pay such excess to Landlord at such time as the statement is delivered, together with interest at the Interest Rate, which interest shall accrue from the close of such preceding Lease Year until the date that such statement is required to be delivered and, thereafter, such interest shall accrue at the Overdue Rate, until the amount of such difference shall be paid or otherwise discharged.  If the annual Additional Rent for such preceding Lease Year as shown in such statement is less than the amount previously paid with respect thereto by Tenant, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Landlord shall grant Tenant a credit against the Additional Rent next coming due in the amount of such difference, together with interest at the Interest Rate, which interest shall accrue from the date of payment by Tenant until the date such credit is applied or paid, as the case may be.  If such credit cannot be made because the Term has expired prior to application in full thereof, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Landlord shall pay the unapplied balance of such credit to Tenant, together with interest at the Interest Rate, which interest shall accrue from the date of payment by Tenant until the date of payment by Landlord.<br>

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Confirmation of Additional Rent</U>. </B> Tenant shall utilize, or cause to be utilized, an accounting system for the Leased Property in accordance with its usual and customary practices and in accordance with GAAP, which will accurately record all Net Resident Revenues and Tenant shall retain, for at least three (3) years after the expiration of each Lease Year, reasonably adequate records conforming to such accounting system showing all Net Resident Revenues for such Lease Year.  Landlord, except as provided hereinbelow, shall have the right, exercisable by Notice to Tenant, by its accountants or representatives, to audit the information set forth in the Officer's Certificate referred to in subparagraph (c) above and, in connection with such audits, to examine Tenant's books and records with respect thereto (including supporting data and sales and excise tax returns).  If any such audit discloses a deficiency in the payment of Additional Rent and, either Tenant agrees with the result of such audit or the matter is otherwise compromised with Landlord, Tenant shall forthwith pay to Landlord the amount of the deficiency, as finally agreed or determined, together with interest at the Interest Rate, from the date such payment should have been made to the date of payment thereof.  If any such audit discloses that Tenant paid more Additional Rent for any Lease Year than was due hereunder, and either Landlord agrees with the result of such audit or the matter is otherwise determined, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Landlord shall grant Tenant a credit against the Additional Rent next coming due in the amount of such difference, as finally agreed or determined, together with interest at the Interest Rate, which interest shall accrue from the time of payment by Tenant until the date such credit is applied or paid, as the case may be.  If such credit cannot be made because the Term has expired prior to application in full thereof, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Landlord shall pay the unapplied balance of such credit to Tenant, together with interest at the Interest Rate, which interest shall accrue from the date of payment by Tenant until the date of payment from Landlord.  Any dispute concerning the correctness of an audit shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of <U>Article 22</U>.  Landlord shall pay for the cost of any such audit; provided, however, in the event that such audit reveals a deficiency in the payment of Additional Rent by Tenant of an aggregate of three percent (3%) or more, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the actual costs of such audit.<br>

If any such Imposition may, at the option of the taxpayer, lawfully be paid in installments (whether or not interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of such Imposition), Tenant may exercise the option to pay the same (and any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of such Imposition) in installments and, in such event, shall pay, or cause to pay, such installments during the Term as the same become due and before any fine, penalty, premium, further interest or cost may be added thereto.  Landlord, at its expense, shall, to the extent required or permitted by Applicable Law, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all tax returns and pay all taxes due in respect of Landlord's net income, gross receipts, sales and use, single business, transaction privilege, rent, ad valorem, franchise taxes and taxes on its capital stock, and Tenant, at its expense, shall, to the extent required or permitted by Applicable Laws and regulations, prepare and file all other tax returns and reports in respect of any Imposition as may be required by Government Agencies.  Provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any refund shall be due from any taxing authority in respect of any Imposition paid by or on behalf of Tenant, the same shall be paid over to or retained by Tenant.  Landlord and Tenant shall, upon request of the other, provide such data as is maintained by the party to whom the request is made with respect to the Leased Property as may be necessary to prepare any required returns and reports.  In the event Government Agencies classify any property covered by this Agreement as personal property, Tenant shall file, or cause to be filed, all personal property tax returns in such jurisdictions where it may legally so file.  Each party shall, to the extent it possesses the same, provide the other, upon request, with cost and depreciation records necessary for filing returns for any property so classified as personal property.  Where Landlord is legally required to file personal property tax returns for property covered by this Agreement, Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of assessment notices in sufficient time for Tenant to file a protest.  All Impositions assessed against such personal property shall be (irrespective of whether Landlord or Tenant shall file the relevant return) paid by Tenant not later than the last date on which the same may be made without interest or penalty, subject to the provisions of <U>Article 8</U>.<br>

To the extent that Tenant pays any Additional Charges directly to Landlord or any Facility Mortgagee pursuant to any requirement of this Agreement, Tenant shall be relieved of its obligation to pay such Additional Charges to the Entity to which they would otherwise be due.

In addition, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Tenant shall not seek, or be entitled to, any abatement, deduction, deferment or reduction of the Rent, or set-off against the Rent, nor shall the respective obligations of Landlord and Tenant be otherwise affected by reason of (a) any damage to or destruction of the Leased Property or any portion thereof from whatever cause or any Condemnation, (b) the lawful or unlawful prohibition of, or restriction upon, Tenant's use of the Leased Property, or any portion thereof, or the interference with such use by any Person or by reason of eviction by paramount title; (c) any claim which Tenant may have against Landlord by reason of any default (other than a monetary default) or breach of any warranty by Landlord under this Agreement or any other agreement between Landlord and Tenant, or to which Landlord and Tenant are parties; (d) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other proceedings affecting Landlord or any assignee or transferee of Landlord; or (e) for any other cause whether similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing (other than a monetary default by Landlord).

If any Default or Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Landlord may, at its option and without prejudice to any other remedy which Landlord may have on account thereof, appropriate and apply the entire Security Deposit or so much thereof as may be necessary to compensate Landlord toward the payment of the Rent or other sums or loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to such breach by Tenant and Tenant shall, upon demand, restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited.  It is understood and agreed that the Security Deposit is not to be considered as prepaid rent, nor shall damages be limited to the amount of the Security Deposit.  Landlord shall have no obligation to pay interest on the Security Deposit and shall have the right to commingle the same with Landlord's other funds.  Should Tenant comply with all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement, the Security Deposit shall be returned in full to Tenant at the end of the Term.  If Landlord conveys Landlord's interest under this Agreement, the Security Deposit, or any part thereof not previously applied, shall be turned over by Landlord to Landlord's grantee, and Tenant shall look solely to such grantee for proper application of the Security Deposit in accordance with the terms of this <U>Section 3.5</U> and the return thereof in accordance herewith.  Landlord agrees that it shall not pledge the Security Deposit to any Facility Mortgagee.  No Facility Mortgagee shall be responsible to Tenant for the return or application of the Security Deposit, whether or not it succeeds to the position of Landlord hereunder.<br>

In the event that any extra premium is payable by Tenant as a result of this provision, Landlord shall not be liable for reimbursement to Tenant for such extra premium.<br><br>


<B>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Form Satisfactory, Etc.</U>  </B>All insurance policies and endorsements required pursuant to this <U>Article 9</U> shall be fully paid for, nonassessable, be issued by insurance carriers authorized to do business in the State, and shall be issued by reputable insurance companies, and otherwise be issued by insurance carriers, having a general policy holder's rating of no less than &#147;A-&#148; in Best's latest rating guide.

In the event Tenant shall take out any such separate insurance or increase any of the amounts of the then existing insurance, Tenant shall give Landlord prompt Notice thereof.

If, during the Term, any Property shall be totally or partially destroyed and the Facility located thereon is thereby rendered Unsuitable for Its Permitted Use, either Landlord or Tenant may, by the giving of Notice thereof to the other, terminate this Agreement with respect to such affected Property, whereupon, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to such affected Property and Landlord shall be entitled to retain the insurance proceeds payable on account of such damage.  In such event, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of any deductible under the insurance policies covering such Facility, the amount of any uninsured loss and any difference between the replacement cost of the affected Property and the casualty insurance proceeds therefor.<br><br>


<B>10.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Partial Damage or Destruction</U>. </B> If, during the Term, any Property shall be totally or partially destroyed but the Facility is not rendered Unsuitable for Its Permitted Use, Tenant shall, subject to <U>Section 10.2.3</U>, promptly restore such Facility as provided in <U>Section 10.2.4</U>.<br><br>

At any time after such termination, whether or not Landlord shall have collected any such current damages, as liquidated final damages beyond the date of such termination, at Landlord's election, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the present value (as reasonably determined by Landlord) of the excess, if any, of the Rent and other charges which would be payable hereunder from the date of such termination (assuming that, for the purposes of this paragraph, annual payments by Tenant on account of Impositions and Additional Rent would be the same as payments required for the immediately preceding twelve calendar months, or if less than twelve calendar months have expired since the Commencement Date, the payments required for such lesser period projected to an annual amount) for what would be the then unexpired term of this Agreement if the same remained in effect, over the fair market rental for the same period.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall, however, limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove and obtain in proceedings for bankruptcy or insolvency an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater than, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.<br><br>


In case of any Event of Default, re-entry, expiration and dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise, Landlord may, (a)&#160;relet the Leased Property or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option, be equal to, less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term and may grant concessions or free rent to the extent that Landlord considers advisable and necessary to relet the same, and (b) may make such reasonable alterations, repairs and decorations in the Leased Property or any portion thereof as Landlord, in its sole and absolute discretion, considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of reletting the Leased Property; and the making of such alterations, repairs and decorations shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid.  Landlord shall in no event be liable in any way whatsoever for any failure to relet all or any portion of the Leased Property, or, in the event that the Leased Property is relet, for failure to collect the rent under such reletting.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed, or in the event of Landlord obtaining possession of the Leased Property, by reason of the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default hereunder.<br>

HOLDING OVER<br>

<br>
Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement shall be treated as a daily tenancy at sufferance at a rate equal to two (2) times the Minimum Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis).  Tenant shall also pay to Landlord all damages (direct or indirect) sustained by reason of any such holding over.  Otherwise, such holding over shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to the extent applicable.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute the consent, express or implied, of Landlord to the holding over of Tenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord or Landlord's nominee fails to obtain all licenses, operating permits and other governmental or quasi-governmental authorizations or contracts which may be necessary for the use and operation of any Facility on or before the expiration of the Term, and provided that Tenant has cooperated with Landlord or Landlord's nominee to effect the transfer of such licenses, permits, authorizations and contracts pursuant to <U>Section 5.3</U>, then Tenant's occupancy after the Term has been terminated or expires shall not be deemed to be holding over under this <U>Article 13</U>, but rather Tenant shall continue to manage the Facility as a tenant at will pursuant to the provisions of <U>Section 5.3</U> until such time as Landlord or its nominee shall be obtained all such necessary authorizations or contracts.<br><br>

</B>If Landlord shall default in the performance or observance of any of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement or any obligation of Landlord, if any, under any agreement affecting any Property, the performance of which is not Tenant's obligation pursuant to this Agreement, and any such default shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after Notice thereof from Tenant to Landlord and any applicable Facility Mortgagee, or such additional period as may be reasonably required to correct the same, Tenant may declare the occurrence of a &#147;<U>Landlord Default</U>&#148; by a second Notice to Landlord and to such Facility Mortgagee.  Thereafter, Tenant may forthwith cure the same and, subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, invoice Landlord for costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by Tenant in curing the same, together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law) from the date Landlord receives Tenant's invoice until paid, at the Overdue Rate.  Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Agreement for any default by Landlord hereunder and no right, for any such default, to offset or counterclaim against any Rent or other charges due hereunder.<br><br>

If Landlord shall in good faith dispute the occurrence of any Landlord Default and Landlord, before the expiration of the applicable cure period, shall give Notice thereof to Tenant, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, no Landlord Default shall be deemed to have occurred and Landlord shall have no obligation with respect thereto until final adverse determination thereof.  If Tenant and Landlord shall fail, in good faith, to resolve any such dispute within ten (10) days after Landlord's Notice of dispute, either may submit the matter for resolution in accordance with <U>Article 22</U>.<br>

SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT</CENTER></U><br><br>

16.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Subletting and Assignment</U>. </B> Except as provided in <U>Sections&#160;16.3 and 16.4</U>, Tenant shall not, without Landlord's prior written consent (which consent may be given or withheld in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion), assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise transfer this Agreement or sublease or permit the sublease (which term shall be deemed to include the granting of concessions, licenses and the like), of all or any part of the Leased Property or suffer or permit this Agreement or the leasehold estate created hereby or any other rights arising under this Agreement to be assigned, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated or encumbered, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, or permit the use or operation of all or any part of the Leased Property by anyone other than Tenant, any Manager approved by Landlord pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Agreement or residents and patients of Tenant, or the Leased Property or any part thereof to be offered or advertised for assignment or subletting.  For purposes of this <U>Section 16.1</U>, an assignment of this Agreement shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any direct or indirect Change in Control of Tenant.<br><br>

If this Agreement is assigned or if all or any part of the Leased Property is sublet (or occupied by anybody other than Tenant or any Manager, their respective employees or residents or patients of Tenant), Landlord may collect the rents from such assignee, subtenant or occupant, as the case may be, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved, but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this <U>Section 16.1</U>, the acceptance by Landlord of such assignee, subtenant or occupant, as the case may be, as a tenant, or a release of Tenant from the future performance by Tenant of its covenants, agreements or obligations contained in this Agreement.<br>

<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>
<BR>

Any assignment or transfer of Tenant's interest under this Agreement shall be subject to such assignee's or transferee's delivery to Landlord of (a) a pledge of the stock, partnership, membership or other ownership interests of such assignee or other transferee to secure Tenant's obligations under the Lease Documents, which pledge shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion and (b) a security agreement granting Landlord a security interest in all of such assignee's or transferee's right, title and interest in and to any personal property, intangibles and fixtures (other than accounts receivable and subject to Permitted Liens) with respect to any Property which is subject to any such assignment or transfer to secure Tenant's obligations under the Lease Documents, which security agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.<br><br>

No subletting or assignment shall in any way impair the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder (unless Landlord and Tenant expressly otherwise agree that Tenant shall be released from all obligations hereunder), and no consent to any subletting or assignment in a particular instance shall be deemed to be a waiver of the prohibition set forth in this <U>Section 16.1</U>.  No assignment, subletting or occupancy shall affect any Permitted Use.  Any subletting, assignment or other transfer of Tenant's interest under this Agreement in contravention of this <U>Section 16.1</U> shall be voidable at Landlord's option.<br><br>

<B>16.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Sublease Provisions</U>. </B> Any sublease of all or any portion of the Leased Property entered into on or after the date hereof shall provide as follows: (a) that it is subject and subordinate to this Agreement and to the matters to which this Agreement is or shall be subject or subordinate; (b) that in the event of termination of this Agreement or reentry or dispossession of Tenant by Landlord under this Agreement, Landlord may, at its option, terminate such sublease or take over all of the right, title and interest of Tenant, as sublessor under such sublease, and such subtenant shall, at Landlord's option, attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of such sublease, except that neither Landlord nor any Facility Mortgagee, as holder of a mortgage or as Landlord under this Agreement, if such Facility Mortgagee succeeds to that position, shall (i) be liable for any act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (ii) be subject to any credit, counterclaim, offset or defense which theretofore accrued to such subtenant against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any previous modification of such sublease not consented to in writing by Landlord or by any previous prepayment of more than one (1) month's Rent, (iv)&#160;be bound by any covenant of Tenant to undertake or complete any construction of the Leased Property or any applicable portion thereof, (v) be required to account for any security deposit of the subtenant other than any security deposit actually delivered to Landlord by Tenant, (vi) be bound by any obligation to make any payment to such subtenant or grant any credits, except for services, repairs, maintenance and restoration provided for under the sublease that are performed after the date of such attornment, (vii) be responsible for any monies owing by Tenant to the credit of such subtenant unless actually delivered to Landlord by Tenant, or (viii) be required to remove any Person occupying any applicable portion of the Leased Property; and (c), in the event that such subtenant receives a written Notice from Landlord or any Facility Mortgagee stating that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under such sublease directly to the party giving such Notice or as such party may direct.  All rentals received from such subtenant by Landlord or the Facility Mortgagee, as the case may be, shall be credited against the amounts owing by Tenant under this Agreement and such sublease shall provide that the subtenant thereunder shall, at the request of Landlord, execute a suitable instrument in confirmation of such agreement to attorn.  An original counterpart of each such sublease and assignment and assumption, duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant or assignee, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, shall be delivered promptly to Landlord and (a) in the case of an assignment, the assignee shall assume in writing and agree to keep and perform all of the terms of this Agreement on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed and shall be, and become, jointly and severally liable with Tenant for the performance thereof and (b) in case of either an assignment or subletting, Tenant shall remain primarily liable, as principal rather than as surety, for the prompt payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder.<br>
