Special Committee says &quot;No need to do anything immediately&quot;<BR>
</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Toronto, Ontario -Canada Life Financial Corporation (Canada Life&trade;) today confirmed it has received Manulife Financial Corporation's unsolicited offer to acquire all of Canada Life's outstanding common shares. </P>
<P>Arthur R. A. Scace, Chairman of the Special Committee of Canada Life's Board of Directors  reminded shareholders that: &quot;There is no need to do anything immediately. Canada Life's Directors will provide shareholders with further information in their Directors' Circular, which will be mailed by January 13<SUP>th</SUP>. There is no reason for shareholders to respond to the Manulife offer at this time. The offer will be open for 60 days and probably longer as a result of Manulife's need to obtain approval from regulatory authorities.  Shareholders will have plenty of time to respond to this unsolicited take-over bid.&quot;</P>
