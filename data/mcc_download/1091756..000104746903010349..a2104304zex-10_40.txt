                       11.5% SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2005


     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Issuer,
designated as its 11.5% Senior Secured Notes Due 2005 (herein called the
"Notes"), limited to the aggregate principal amount of $19,075,000, all issued
or to be issued under and pursuant to (x) a Securities Exchange Agreement dated
as of January 30, 2003 (herein called the "Symphony Exchange Agreement"), among
the Issuer, iBasis Securities Corporation, the Symphony Funds party thereto and
U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent (herein called the
"Collateral Agent"), and (y) a Securities Exchange Agreement dated as of
February 21, 2003 (herein called the "Permitted Exchange Agreement" and,
together with the Symphony Exchange Agreement, the "Exchange Agreements"), among
the Issuer, iBasis Securities Corporation, the Exchanging Holders party thereto
and the Collateral Agent, to which Exchange Agreements and all exchange
agreements supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of
the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder
of the Collateral Agent, the Issuer and the holders of the Notes. The Issuer has
appointed U.S. Bank National Association as fiscal agent, (herein called the
"Fiscal Agent") and as paying agent in respect of the Notes upon the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in a Fiscal Agency Agreement dated as of
January 30, 2003, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Fiscal Agency Agreement dated
as of February 21, 2003 (as amended, the "Fiscal Agency Agreement"), between the
Issuer and the Fiscal Agent.

     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) shall
have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
interest on all Notes may be declared by either the Collateral Agent or the
holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the
manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Exchange
Agreements.

     The Exchange Agreements contain provisions prohibiting the changing,
waiver, discharge or termination of the Exchange Agreements without the consent
of each holder of a Note directly affected thereby if such change, waiver,
discharge or termination shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Note, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the
principal amount thereof, (ii) amend, modify or waive the provisions of Section
13.4 of either Exchange Agreement, (iii) reduce the percentage specified in, or
otherwise modify the definition of "Demand Holders" or "Required Holders" stated
therein, (iv) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Issuer of any of its
rights and obligations under the Exchange Agreements, (v) establish any new
obligations for any holder of a Note not relating to the subject matter of the
Exchange Agreements or (ii) release all or substantially all of the collateral
or guarantees with respect to the Obligations specified in the Exchange
Agreements. Subject to the provisions of the Exchange Agreements, the holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time

<Page>

outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past
Default or Event of Default under the Exchange Agreements and its consequences
except a default in the payment of interest. Any such consent or waiver by the
holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Exchange Agreements)
shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and
owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or
substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made
upon this Note or such other Notes.

     The indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is, to the extent and in the manner
provided in the Subordination Agreement dated as of January 30, 2003 (herein
called the "Subordination Agreement"), among the Investors party thereto,
Silicon Valley Bank, and U.S. Bank National Association, subordinated and
subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt (as
defined in the Subordination Agreement), and this Note is issued subject to the
provisions of the Subordination Agreement with respect to such subordination.
Each holder of this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by
such provisions.

     No reference herein to the Exchange Agreements, the Fiscal Agency Agreement
or the Subordination Agreement and no provision of this Note or of the Exchange
Agreements, the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Subordination Agreement shall
alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note
at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency
herein prescribed.

     Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.

     The Notes are issuable in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any integral multiple of $1,000. At
the office or agency of the Issuer referred to on the face hereof, and in the
manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Exchange Agreements,
without payment of any service charge but with payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any registration or exchange of Notes, Notes may be exchanged
for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any other authorized
denominations.

     The Notes may be prepaid at the election of the Issuer, as a whole or in
part from time to time, at any time, upon notice as set forth in Section 4.2 of
the Exchange Agreements, at the following prepayment prices (expressed in
percentages of the outstanding principal amount of the Note, as the case may be,
being prepaid) plus accrued and unpaid interest on such prepaid principal amount
to the prepayment date, MINUS the number of percentage points reflected by the
product of (i) 10.1695 and (ii) the difference between (A) the average closing
trading price of the Common Stock of iBasis, Inc. (the "Common Stock") for the
five trading days immediately prior to, but not including, the date of such
prepayment and (B) the Common Stock price denoted below in the column titled
"Minimum Common Stock Price" (the "Note Prepayment Price"); provided, however,
that in no event shall the Note Prepayment Price be less than 100% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on such principal amount to the prepayment date:

     If a Change of Control (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) occurs at
any time prior to maturity of the Notes, the Issuer shall, within one Business
Day, make an offer to prepay all of the Notes then outstanding at the Note
Prepayment Price set forth above. If the Issuer or any Subsidiary receives any
Net Asset Sale Proceeds (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) in excess of
$250,000 (or if a Default or an Event of Default shall then exist, regardless of
amount), which in each such case does not result in a Change of Control, then
the Issuer shall, within one Business Day pay (or cause its Subsidiary receiving
such proceeds to pay) to the holders as a prepayment of the Notes the lesser of
(a) the amount of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds and (b) the Aggregate Prepayment
Amount (excluding any portion of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds which so long as
no Default or Event of Default exists, (x) in the case of proceeds of business
interruption insurance, is used in the ordinary course of the Issuer's and its
Subsidiaries' business and (y) in the case of proceeds of casualty insurance, is
applied for the purpose of replacing, repairing, restoring or rebuilding the
relevant tangible property).

     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the
office or agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in accordance with
the terms of the Fiscal Agency Agreement, a new Note or Notes of authorized
denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the
transferee in exchange thereof; subject to the limitations provided in the
Exchange Agreements and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, without charge except for
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed in connection
therewith.

     The Issuer, the Fiscal Agent, any authenticating agent, any paying agent
and any Note registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the
absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and
notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone
other than the Issuer or any Note registrar) for the purpose of receiving

<Page>

payment hereof, or on account hereof, for the conversion hereof and for all
other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Fiscal Agent nor any other
authenticating agent nor any paying agent nor other conversion agent nor any
Note registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All payments
made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the extent of the
sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this
Note.

     No recourse for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest
on this Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, and
no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in
the Exchange Agreements or any supplemental exchange agreement or in any Note,
or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, officer or director or
subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuer or of any successor
corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the
enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being,
by acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof,
expressly waived and released.

     This Note shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and for all purposes shall be construed in
accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

     Terms used in this Note and defined in the Exchange Agreements are used
herein as therein defined.
