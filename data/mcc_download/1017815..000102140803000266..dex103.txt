called the "Borrower") jointly and severally promise to pay to the order of
("Lender"), at such other place as Lender may from time to time designate in
writing, the principal sum of ______ ($___) (the "Principal Amount"), pursuant
to that certain Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated of even date
herewith (as amended and in effect from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"),
together with (i) interest at the rate and in the

<PAGE>

manner provided in the Loan Agreement; (ii) all fees, premiums and charges which
may become due under the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (as
defined in the Loan Agreement); (iii) any costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' and appraiser's fees incurred in the collection of this
Note or the enforcement of the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, foreclosure thereunder or in any litigation or controversy arising
from or connected with this Note, or the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents; and (iv) all taxes or duties, other than income taxes, assessed upon
said sum against Lender or upon the debt evidenced hereby. All amounts owing
under this Note and interest thereon shall be payable in legal tender of the
United States of America. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Loan Agreement.

     Equal quarterly payments of principal in the amount of ___________
($_______ be due and payable commencing on January 1, 2003 and continuing on the
first day of each of the three succeeding quarters thereafter with the last of
such payments due on October 1, 2003. Equal quarterly payments of principal in
the amount of _________Dollars ($__) shall be due and payable commencing on
January 1, 2004 and continuing on the first day of each succeeding quarter
thereafter until October 1, 2007 (the "Maturity Date"). On the Maturity Date,
Borrower shall pay in full the outstanding Principal Amount together with all
interest accrued thereon.

     Interest on the Principal Amount shall be computed and shall be payable at
the rate and in the manner as provided in the Loan Agreement until all of said
Principal Amount has been fully paid, whether before or after the Maturity Date,
by acceleration or otherwise, and whether or not any judgment is obtained
hereon.

     In the event that Lender has not received, within fifteen (15) days of its
due date, any installment of the Principal Amount and interest (upon the
Maturity Date or otherwise), or payment with respect to any other payment due
under this Note, Borrower shall be subject to a late charge equal to two percent
(2%) of such amount due.

     Upon the failure by Borrower to pay principal or interest under this Note
when due and payable, or an Event of Default as defined in the Loan Agreement or
in any other Loan Documents, Lender may, at its option, accelerate Borrower's
obligations hereunder and declare the entire unpaid Principal Amount, together
with accrued interest and all other amounts then due which are evidenced by this
Note, to be immediately due and payable, without the necessity for demand or
additional notice. In addition, upon the occurrence of such default or Event of
Default or after the Maturity Date, all principal and accrued but unpaid
interest shall bear interest until paid in full, payable on demand at the
Default Rate. Failure to exercise these options shall not constitute a waiver of
the right to exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default.

     Borrower may prepay the 2002 Term Loan only as permitted in the Loan
Agreement.

     Notwithstanding any provisions of this Note, it is the understanding and
agreement of Borrower and Lender that the maximum rate of interest to be paid by
Borrower to Lender shall not exceed the highest of the maximum rate of interest
permissible to be charged by Lender under applicable laws. Any amount paid in
excess of such rate shall be deemed to be a payment

<PAGE>

in reduction of principal except to the extent that such amount is in excess of
the then outstanding Principal Amount, in which event such excess shall be
returned to the Borrower.

     This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Connecticut. This Note shall bind the successors and assigns of
Borrower, and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and
assigns. This Note may not be changed or terminated orally, but only by an
agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such
change or termination is sought.

     Whenever in this Note words of any gender appear, they shall be deemed to
apply equally to any other gender. Whenever used in this Note, the plural shall
include the singular and the singular shall include the plural, as the context
shall require. In the event that Borrower consists of more than one person or
entity, the obligations hereunder shall be joint and several.

constitute an "Event of Default" under this Note:

         1. Failure to make when due any payment of principal or interest or any
sum due under this Note when the same shall be due and payable.

         2. The occurrence of an Event of Default or notice of termination under
the Loan Agreement.

         Upon and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the whole of said indebtedness, both principal and interest, and
including any other sums which may become due under this Note, shall, at the
option of the holder of this Note, immediately become due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest, or other notice or notice of
dishonor of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

         The Borrower agrees that no delay or failure on the part of the holder
in exercising any power, privilege, remedy, option or right under this Note
shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other power, privilege, remedy or
right; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power, privilege, remedy,
option or right hereunder preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other power, privilege, remedy, option or right. The rights and
remedies expressed herein are cumulative, and may be enforced successively,
alternately, or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which holder may or would otherwise have under the provisions of all applicable
laws, and under the provisions of all agreements between the Borrower and the
Lender.

         The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice, protest and all
other demands and notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance,
performance, default or enforcement of this Note, assents to any extension or
postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence and/or to the
addition or release of any party or person primarily or secondarily liable.

         The Borrower gives the Lender a lien and right of setoff for all of
Borrower's liabilities upon and against the Borrower's deposits, credits and
property, now or hereafter in the possession or control of the Lender or in
transit to it. The Lender may, at any time, apply the same or any part thereof,
to any of the Borrower's liability, though unmatured, without notice and without
first resorting to any other collateral.

         This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Connecticut.

         This Note constitutes the amendment and restatement in its entirety of
the BV Note of the Borrower to the Lender in the original principal amount of
$__ dated June 14, 1999 (the "Original Note"), and is in substitution therefor
and an amendment and replacement thereof. Nothing herein or in any other
document shall be construed to constitute payment of the Original Note or to
release or terminate any guaranty or any lien, mortgage, pledge or other
security interest in favor of the Lender.

         TO INDUCE LENDER TO ENTER INTO THE COMMERCIAL LOAN TRANSACTION
EVIDENCED BY THIS NOTE, THE LOAN AGREEMENT, AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
EVIDENCING OR SECURING THE SAME, BORROWER AGREES THAT THIS IS A COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION AND NOT A CONSUMER TRANSACTION, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO NOTICE AND A
HEARING AND AUTHORIZES LENDER'S ATTORNEY TO ISSUE A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT
REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER, PROVIDED THE COMPLAINT SHALL SET FORTH A COPY OF
THIS WAIVER AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE AGAINST LENDER'S
ATTORNEY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF SUCH ISSUANCE OF A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY
WITHOUT COURT ORDER. BORROWER FURTHER WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO REQUEST
THAT LENDER POST A BOND IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PREJUDGEMENT REMEDY. BORROWER
ACKNOWLEDGES AND STIPULATES THAT SUCH WAIVER AND AUTHORIZATION GRANTED ABOVE ARE
MADE KNOWINGLY AND FREELY AND AFTER FULL CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL.
SPECIFICALLY, BORROWER RECOGNIZES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THE EXERCISE OF LENDER'S
RIGHTS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY RESULT IN THE ATTACHMENT OF OR LEVY AGAINST
BORROWER'S PROPERTY, AND SUCH WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WILL NOT HAVE THE
PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OR SCRUTINY OF A COURT OF LAW OR OTHER JUDICIAL OFFICER
NOR WILL BORROWER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANY NOTICE OR PRIOR HEARING WHERE BORROWER
MIGHT CONTEST SUCH A PROCEDURE. THE INTENT OF BORROWER IS TO GRANT TO LENDER FOR
GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN SUCH A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY
AND TO EXPRESS ITS BELIEF THAT ANY SUCH PREJUDGMENT REMEDY OBTAINED IS VALID AND
CONSTITUTIONAL.

         BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (1) ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, OR (2) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH
RESPECT TO THIS NOTE OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND THE BORROWER HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND LENDER MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF
THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH OF THEM
TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

         This Note is the BV Note referred to in, entitled to the benefits of,
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement.
