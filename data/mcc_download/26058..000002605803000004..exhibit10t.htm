$200,000 (for the Plan Year beginning July 1, 2002, adjusted by the Commissioner for
increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code). The
cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not
exceeding 12 months, over which Pay is determined (determination period) beginning in such
calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the Code
Section 401(a)(17) annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of completed months in the determination period, and the
denominator of which is 12: provided, however, that no such proration shall be required
for an Employee who is covered under the Plan for less than the full Plan Year. In

          such an Employee shall participate immediately upon reemployment. <BR><BR>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely for
          purposes of determining whether a Break-in-Service, for participation and
          vesting purposes, has occurred in a computation period, an individual, who (1)
          is absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons or (2) is absent from
          work, up to 12 weeks, on or after August 5, 1993 and such absence qualifies for
          leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, shall receive credit for
          the Hours of Service which would otherwise have been credited to such individual
          but for such absence, or in any case in which such hours cannot be determined,
          ten Hours of Service per day of such absence. For purposes of this paragraph, an
          absence from work for maternity or paternity reasons means an absence (1) by
          reason of the pregnancy of the individual, (2) by reason of a birth of a child
          of the individual, (3) by reason of the placement of a child with the individual
          in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or (4) for
          purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following
          such birth or placement. The Hours of Service credited under this paragraph
          shall be credited (1) in the computation period in which the absence begins if
          the crediting is necessary to prevent a Break-in-Service in that period, or (2)
          in all other cases, in the following computation period. This section is
          intended to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. In the event
          of any conflict, the Family and Medical Leave Act shall prevail. </FONT></P>

paragraph, a Plan amendment which has the effect of (1) eliminating or reducing an early

benefit, with respect to benefits attributable to Service before the amendment shall be
treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the
preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to an Employee who satisfied (either
before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. In general, a
retirement-type subsidy is a subsidy that continues after retirement, but does not include

          Supplemental Claims Procedures for Disability Pension Benefits. Effective for
          all claims filed on or after January 1, 2002, in the case of a claim for

          from being rendered within that extension period, the period for making the
          determination may be extended for an additional thirty (30) days, provided that

(1) seventy-five (75) days after the date on which the claim was filed in the case of the
first extension, or (2) one hundred and five (105) days after the date on which the claim

issues that prevent a final decision from being rendered on the claim, (3) the additional
information needed to resolve those issues, and (4) that the Claimant shall be afforded

must provide additional information to allow the Plan Administrator to make a decision on
the claim, the review period shall be tolled until such information is provided. </FONT></P>
