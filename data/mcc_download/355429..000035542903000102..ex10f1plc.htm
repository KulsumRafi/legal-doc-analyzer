                                                      DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN<br>
                                                             FOR DIRECTORS WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF TEH COMPANY<br>
                                                           NOVEMBER 4, 2002</h3>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective Life  Corporation  (the "Company")  hereby amends the Protective Life Corporation  Deferred  Compensation  Plan for
Directors Who Are Not Employees of the Company (the "Plan").</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.       Sections 4(c)(1) and 4(c)(2) of the Plan are amended to read in their entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                           <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)(1)   If a stock  allotment is elected in whole or in part,  the Account  shall be credited  with a stock
                  equivalent that shall be equal to the number of full and fractional  shares of the Company's  Common Stock, par value
                  $0.50 per share (the "Common  Stock"),  that could be purchased  with the dollar  amount of the  allotment  using the
                  average of the Closing  Price (as defined  below) of the Common  Stock for the twenty (20) trading days ending on the
                  day preceding the date the Account is so credited.  The "Closing  Price" of the Common Stock on any trading day means
                  the daily closing price for a share of the Common Stock on the Composite  Tape for the New York Stock Exchange or, if
                  the Common Stock is not listed on such Exchange,  on the principal United States securities exchange registered under
                  the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on which the Common Stock is listed or, if the
                  Common Stock is not listed on any such exchange,  the average of the daily closing bid  quotations  with respect to a
                  share of the Common Stock on the National  Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc.,  Automated  Quotations System or
                  any system then in use or, if no such quotations are available,  the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock
                  as determined by a majority of the Board;  provided,  however,  that if a Change in Control (as defined  below) shall
                  have  occurred,  then such  determination  shall be made by a majority  of the  Continuing  Directors  (as defined in
                  Protective Life Corporation's Rights Agreement, as in effect from time to time).</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>(2)      The  Account  also shall be  credited as of the  payment  date for each  dividend  on the Common  Stock with
                  additional stock  equivalents  computed by (A) multiplying the dividend paid,  either in cash or property (other than
                  Common  Stock),  upon a share of Common Stock to a shareholder  of record by the number of stock  equivalents  in the
                  Account,  and (B) dividing the product thereof by the Closing Price on the trading day preceding the dividend payment
                  date.  In the case of dividends  payable in property,  the amount paid shall be based on the fair market value of the
                  property at the time of distribution of the dividend,  as determined by a majority of the Board;  provided,  however,
                  that if a Change  in  Control  shall  have  occurred,  then such  determination  shall be made by a  majority  of the
                  Continuing Directors.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.       A new Section 7(h) is added to the Plan after Section 7(g), such new Section 7(h) to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>(h)      Compliance  with Legal and Exchange  Requirements.  The Plan,  and the  obligations of the Company under the
                  Plan, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations,  and to such approvals by any
                  regulatory or governmental agency as may be required.  The Company, in its discretion,  may (1) postpone the issuance
                  or delivery of Common  Stock or any other action  permitted  under the Plan to permit the  Company,  with  reasonable
                  diligence,  to complete such stock exchange  listing or registration or  qualification  of such Common Stock or other
                  required  action  under any  federal  or state  law,  rule or  regulation,  (2)  require  any  Director  to make such
                  representations  and furnish such  information  as it may consider  appropriate  in  connection  with the issuance or
                  delivery of Common Stock in compliance with applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations,  and (3) pay the Director,  in
                  lieu of shares of Common  Stock,  cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Closing Price of the Common Stock
                  as of the most recent practicable date before the date of payment,  multiplied by (B) the number of stock equivalents
                  in the  Account.  The Company  shall not be  obligated  to sell or issue  Common Stock in violation of any such laws,
                  rules or regulations,  and neither the Company nor its directors,  officers or employees shall have any obligation or
                  liability to a Director with respect to the Director's Account (or Common Stock issuable  thereunder)  because of any
                  actions taken pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(h).</FONT></P>
