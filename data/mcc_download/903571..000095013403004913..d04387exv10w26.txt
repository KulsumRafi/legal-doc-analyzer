         registered under the laws of Ghana of P. O. Box 3634 Accra in the
         Greater Accra Region (hereinafter referred to as "SGMC"),

         Ghana Mineworkers Union of the TUC (Ghana) as the majority shareholder
         of PGR and as representative of the unionised employees of PGR
         (hereinafter referred to as "GMWU"), and,

         The Republic of Ghana, acting through the Minister of Mines
         (hereinafter referred to as "Government"),

WHEREAS:

A.       In 1994 Government, acting through the Divestiture Implementation
         Committee divested its interest in PGL to JCI Limited and accordingly
         the Government also granted a 30 year gold Mining Lease to the said
         Company over the Prestea Concession Area (the "JCI Mining Lease").

B.       Pursuant to the said divestiture a certain Project Development and
         Prestea Main Agreement respectively dated September 13, 1995 and May
         20, 1996 were made between JCI Limited, Barnato Exploration Limited,
         Barnex (Prestea) Limited (collectively the "JCI Group") the Government,
         SGMC and PGL (the "Prestea Agreements") whereby certain specific rights
         were acquired and obligations assumed by the parties thereto in
         relation to the Prestea Concession Area including the right of the JCI
         Group to acquire at its sole discretion all or any of the Underground
         Mining Assets.

C.       In accordance with the Prestea Agreements the JCI Group assumed
         management of the Underground Mine until September 16, 1998 when the
         JCI Group informed the Government that it could no longer operate the
         Underground Mine economically and therefore ceased same whilst
         retaining the JCI Mining Lease.

D.       SGMC is the beneficial owner of the Underground Mining Assets through
         its 100% owned and controlled subsidiary PGL which is the legal owner
         of the Underground Mining Assets.

E.       In December 1998, PGR upon application to the Government through the
         Divestiture Implementation Committee obtained the consent and approval
         of the Government, the JCI Group, and SGMC to take over and operate the
         Underground Mine using therefor

         the Underground Mining Assets on an interim basis and subject
         specifically to the rights vested in the JCI Group under the subsisting
         Prestea Agreements.

F.       In October 2000 or thereabouts some differences arose between the
         Government and the JCI Group in relation to the subsisting Prestea
         Agreements, the JCI Mining Lease and the competing interests of third
         parties including PGR, PSGL and BGL in relation to the Prestea
         Concession Area.

G.       In an effort to find a compromise solution to the major issues relating
         to the Prestea Concession Area, the Government by letter dated March
         29, 2001 appointed the then Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana
         Chamber of Mines, Mr. Bentum Williams as Mediator with a specific
         mandate to find a negotiated solution that would harmonise the
         interests of the JCI Group, PGR, PSGL and BGL in the Prestea Concession
         Area and also ensure sustainable mining operations within the Prestea -
         Bogoso area. The Mediator issued a final report to the Government dated
         May 21, 2001 which said report is attached as Schedule "A" making
         therein specific recommendations in relation to the Prestea Concession
         Area which said recommendations were subsequently accepted by
         Government and provide the basis for the entry into and implementation
         of new commercial arrangements relating to the Prestea Concession Area
         among various parties.

H.       In furtherance of the new commercial arrangements, (i) Golden Star
         Resources Ltd ("Golden Star"), the parent of BGL, entered into the
         Barnex Agreement whereby Golden Star committed to pay approximately $12
         million in Golden Star stock and royalties to Barnato Exploration
         Limited, (ii) BGL entered into the Investment Agreement with PGR
         whereby PGR surrendered its then rights over the Prestea Concession
         Area in favour of the grant of the PGR Mining Lease and cash payments
         of up to $4.0 million from BGL, of which $2.1 million has been paid,
         and (iii) the parties to the Prestea Agreements decided to terminate
         the Prestea Agreements on mutually agreed terms and conditions to
         facilitate the entry into and implementation of various new agreements
         relating to the Prestea Concession Area with a view to permitting the
         co-existence of underground mining operations and surface mining
         operations.

I.       PGR was granted the PGR Mining Lease by the Government on June 29, 2001
         conferring on PGR the exclusive right to conduct underground gold
         mining operations within the Prestea Concession Area below a depth of
         150 metres below sea level for a period of thirty (30) years effective
         from the date of the said PGR Mining Lease as specifically defined in
         the said PGR Mining Lease.

J.       Similarly, BGL was granted the BGL Mining Lease by the Government on
         June 29, 2001 conferring on the company the exclusive right to conduct
         surface gold mining operations over the Prestea Concession Area for a
         period of thirty (30) years effective from the date of the said BGL
         Mining Lease as specifically defined in the said BGL Mining Lease.

K.       PGR and BGL have with the consent and approval of the Government
         entered into the Investment Agreement to promote jointly both surface
         and, if feasible, underground gold mining operations on the Prestea
         Concession Area.

L.       Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, BGL has paid $2.1 million to PGR
         and the parties have entered into the Joint Operating Agreement.

M.       PGR, PGL and SGMC have entered into the Licence Agreement, whereby PGR
         has the right to utilize the Underground Mining Assets in return for
         the payment of rent to PGL.

N.       PGR discontinued underground gold mining operations on January 21, 2002
         due to an industrial action.

O.       PGR is highly indebted with total liabilities to creditors (excluding
         employee liabilities) of approximately $10.5 million and has been
         operating at a loss.

P.       Government intends to use best endeavours to cause the creditors of
         PGR, in so far as it is able, to enter into an arrangement with PGR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         (c)      the JV shall employ such number of employees required for the
                  Care & Maintenance and shall give preference to the PGR
                  Employees provided that such PGR Employees have the requisite
                  skills.

4.2      The JV shall conduct an Assessment to determine the (i) safety
         conditions and practices at the Underground Mine, (ii) environmental
         practices at the Underground Mine, (iii) resource potential of the PGR
         Mining Lease, and (iv) economic viability of a new mining operation on
         the PGR Mining Lease. The broad principles covering the Assessment are
         as follows:

         (a)      the Assessment will be carried out by the JV primarily using
                  consultants;

         (b)      the Assessment will be funded by the JV which shall be sole
                  funded by BGL;

         (c)      the Assessment is expected to take twenty-four (24) months but
                  could be longer or shorter depending on the findings; and

         (d)      during the Assessment, the JV Parties will receive regular,
                  quarterly reports on the progress of the Assessment as well as
                  copies of any definitive reports on the various aspects of the
                  Assessment.

4.3      Upon the completion of the Assessment the JV Parties and provided that
         the Feasibility Study demonstrates that such redevelopment of the
         Underground Mine is economically justified, the JV Parties shall
         consider the redevelopment of the Underground Mine and make a Decision
         to Mine.

4.4      Upon the Decision to Mine, or earlier by mutual agreement, the JV
         Parties will enter into the Joint Venture Agreement and establish the
         Exploitation Company in Ghana.

4.5      Upon the establishment of the Exploitation Company, BGL shall transfer
         the PGR Mining Lease to the Exploitation Company.

                     ARTICLE 5 - FORMATION OF JOINT VENTURE

5.1      On the Effective Date, the JV Parties shall form the JV by:

         (a)      PGR contributing (i) the PGR Mining Lease, (ii) its mining
                  assets and inventory, (iii) its interest in certain
                  agreements, as detailed in Article 7.2, and (iv) its Back Pay
                  and Severance Benefit obligations totalling not more than
                  $2,400,000 to the JV;

         (b)      BGL obligating $2,400,000 to the JV;

         (c)      The Government approving the transfer of the PGR Mining Lease
                  to BGL, to be held by BGL for the benefit of the JV until the
                  earlier of (i) BGL electing to terminate this Agreement, and
                  (ii) the Exploitation Company is formed;

         (d)      PGR transferring, for the duration of the JV, the rights and
                  obligations of PGR under the Joint Operating Agreement, the
                  Environmental Indemnity, and the Licence Agreement to the JV;
                  and

         (e)      PGR delivering, within seven (7) calendar days of the
                  Effective Date, a settlement agreement between PGR and its
                  employees accepting the Back Pay and Severance Benefit (as
                  more fully described in Article 3) as a full and final
                  settlement for the termination of their employment with PGR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5.2      Upon the Decision to Mine, or earlier by mutual agreement, the JV
         Parties will enter into the Joint Venture Agreement. The JV Parties
         undertake to negotiate the definitive Joint Venture Agreement in good
         faith.

5.3      Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all JV Assets held or
         acquired by the Manager in fulfilment of its obligations for the Joint
         Venture, or by a JV Party, are beneficially owned by the JV Parties in
         undivided shares as tenants-in-common in proportion to their respective
         Participating Interests from time to time, and the Parties hereby waive
         all rights of partition and of sale in lieu of partition (including as
         arise under Law) with respect to that property. The JV Parties hereby
         agree that, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if
         they are jointly and severally liable in Ghana and elsewhere under this
         Agreement, they must indemnify and hold each other harmless, subject to
         this Agreement, to the extent they incur liability in respect thereof
         in excess of their Participating Interest share of that liability.

5.4      None of the JV Parties will have any liability for any indebtedness or
         liabilities of the other JV Parties.

5.5      As long as BGL's Participating Interest is equal to or greater than
         30%, BGL will have the continuing right to act as Manager of the JV.
         The Manager shall be responsible for the day-to-day management,
         conduct, and control of the Operations, subject to approved work plans
         and budgets and the direction of the Management Committee referred to
         below. The JV Parties shall in good faith negotiate and specify the
         powers and obligations of the Manager which shall be included in the
         Joint Venture Agreement.

5.6      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Manager
         will not be liable to any JV Party for any act or omission resulting in
         damages or loss except to the extent caused by or attributable to the
         Manager's wilful misconduct or gross negligence.

5.7      The Manager will be entitled to charge a management fee of 2% of
         expenditure. The purpose of this fee will not be to provide the Manager
         with a profit, but to allow the Manager to recover indirect costs it
         incurs in fulfilling its obligations as Manager. As a result, the JV
         Parties must review the fee annually and the fee will be adjusted
         annually if unanimously approved by all JV Parties and if the JV
         Parties unanimously determine it to be insufficient or excessive. This
         management fee will be considered to be an ordinary operating expenses
         of the JV and will therefore be paid by each JV Party in accordance
         with its Participating Interest.

5.8      Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, until completion of the
         Feasibility Study all final decisions relating to Operations shall be
         made and undertaken by BGL, but reasonable consultation on these
         decisions prior to their execution will be held with the JV Parties,
         and the agreement or disagreement of the JV Parties formally recorded.
         Upon completion of the Feasibility Study, all decisions relating to the
         conduct of Operations and relating to the Joint Operating Agreement
         shall be made by the Management Committee, a governing body to be
         appropriately structured to serve the type of business entity chosen
         under the Joint Venture Agreement. Prior to execution of the Joint
         Venture Agreement, the JV Parties hereby designate their respective
         representatives on the Management Committee to be as follows:

         (a)      for BGL:           Managing Director

         (b)      for PGR:           Chairman, and

<PAGE>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         (c)      for Government     one representative.

5.9      The JV Parties shall have on the Management Committee a number of votes
         proportionate to their respective Participating Interest, regardless of
         the number of representatives, and each shall designate one person or
         an alternate to cast such votes.

5.10     All decisions of the Management Committee will be taken by simple
         majority vote. BGL, if continuing to hold a 30% or greater interest in
         the project, shall determine, at its sole election, whether to proceed
         with the Feasibility Study.

5.11     Prior to completion of the Feasibility Study, it is the intention of
         the JV Parties that the Management Committee shall hold informal but
         periodic reviews (at least quarterly unless otherwise agreed to by the
         JV Parties) of Operations. Following completion of the Feasibility
         Study, the Management Committee shall hold quarterly meetings in Accra,
         Ghana, or such other mutually agreed place. Although the JV Parties
         contemplate holding meetings to review work plans and budgets for each
         phase of work undertaken, the JV Parties do not contemplate holding
         regular formal meetings prior to completion of the Feasibility Study.
         Meetings may be held by telephone.

5.12     As of the Effective Date BGL will have a 45% Participating Interest,
         PGR will have a 45% Participating Interest, and Government will have a
         10% Carried Interest.

5.13     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the JV Parties
         agree that, in addition to the initial $2,400,000 contribution to the
         JV, BGL shall be entitled to and obligated to be the sole provider of
         funding for (i) the Care & Maintenance, (ii) the Assessment, and (iii)
         the completion of a Feasibility Study.

5.14     From the Effective Date until the completion of the Feasibility Study,
         or in the event that a JV Party (other than Government) following the
         completion of the Feasibility Study fails to advance funds as required
         under this Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement, then its
         Participating Interest will be diluted in accordance with the following
         formula:

         PC#1 + PC#2 + PC#3
         ------------------
         JV#1 + JV#2 + JV#3                 times 90%; where

         PC#1 means JV Party's initial contributions (deemed to be $2.4 million
         for both BGL and PGR);

         PC#2 means JV Party's additional contributions;

         PC#3 means the amount, if any, that the JV Party elects to contribute
         to the approved work plan and budget;

         JV#1 means the initial contributions of all JV Parties (deemed to be
         $4.8 million);

         JV#2 means the additional contributions of all JV Parties; and

         JV#3 means the amount that all JV Parties elect to contribute to the
         approved work plan and budget.

5.15     For the avoidance of doubt, the Governments interest shall not be
         diluted and at all times shall be 10%.

5.16     If a JV Party (other than Government) fails within a reasonable period
         to make a contribution or cash call which it previously committed to
         make under an approved work plan and budget, it shall be in default and
         shall be diluted on a straight line basis to a minimum 10%
         participating interest at which time the diluted JV Party will be
         assigned a 2.5% net profits interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5.17     For a period of ninety (90) Business Days after the completion of the
         Feasibility Study, BGL shall have the right, at it sole election, to
         acquire the rights and obligations of PGR in the Joint Venture for a
         total consideration of $6.5 million.

5.18     BGL may withdraw from this Agreement upon completion of the Assessment
         and determining that the redevelopment of the underground mine is not
         viable to the extent that the project is not bankable with a reputable
         international financial institution.

5.19     In the event that any JV Party (other than Government) elects to enter
         into voluntary insolvency or becomes insolvent in accordance with the
         Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidations) Act 1963 (Act. 180), the
         insolvent party shall be deemed to have retired from the JV and their
         rights and obligations under this agreement shall be forfeited. In the
         event of retirement, the rights and obligation of the retiring party
         shall be assumed by the remaining JV Parties (other than Government) in
         proportion to their holdings in the JV at the time of retirement.

                   ARTICLE 6 - BGL'S SURFACE MINING OPERATIONS

6.1      The Parties agree that BGL shall be entitled to continue its
         development of the BGL Mining Lease.

         is formed.

7.4      PGR hereby undertakes to deliver, within seven (7) calendar days of the
         Effective Date, a settlement agreement between PGR and its employees
         accepting the Back Pay and Severance Benefit (as more fully described
         in Article 3) as a full and final settlement for the termination of
         their employment with PGR.

7.5      PGR undertakes to meet with its creditors to arrive at a settlement.
         This could be an agreement by the creditors to wait until some future
         time when the underground mine is redeveloped or an agreement by the
         creditors to take shares in PGR in lieu of the monies owed to them.

                    ARTICLE 8 - UNDERTAKINGS BY SGMC AND PGL

8.1      SGMC and PGL hereby agree that the notice required in Clause 5 of the
         Licence Agreement to demolish the assets described in Fourth Schedule
