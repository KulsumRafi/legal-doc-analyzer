                           COMPETITIVE  ADVANCE AND  REVOLVING  CREDIT  FACILITY
                           AGREEMENT  (as  it may be  amended,  supplemented  or
                           otherwise  modified,  the  "Agreement")  dated  as of
                           February  26,  2003,  among  THE  HARTFORD  FINANCIAL
                           SERVICES  GROUP,  INC., a Delaware  corporation  (the
                           "Company");  each Borrowing  Subsidiary party hereto;
                           the lenders  listed in Schedule 2.01  (together  with
                           their  permitted  assignees,   the  "Lenders");   and
                           JPMORGAN  CHASE BANK and BANK OF  AMERICA,  N.A.,  as
                           co-administrative  agents  for the  Lenders  (in such
                           capacity,  the  "Co-Administrative  Agents", it being
                           agreed   that   all   references    herein   to   the
                           "Administrative   Agent"  shall  be   references   to
                           JPMorgan Chase Bank).


                  On December 20, 1996, the Company,  the  Administrative  Agent
and certain of the Lenders  entered  into a  Five-Year  Competitive  Advance and
Revolving  Credit Facility  Agreement  pursuant to which the lenders  thereunder
agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers.  On June 20, 2001, the parties amended
the Five-Year  Competitive  Advance and Revolving Credit Facility  Agreement and
restated it in its  entirety  (the  "Existing  Credit  Agreement").  The parties
hereto desire to further amend the Existing  Credit  Agreement and to restate it
in its entirety giving effect to such amendment.  Therefore,  the parties hereto
agree that the Existing  Credit  Agreement shall be amended and restated to read
in its entirety as set forth herein.

                  The  Lenders  have  been  requested  to  extend  credit to the
Borrowers  (such term and each  other  capitalized  term used but not  otherwise
defined herein having the meaning assigned to it in Article I) to enable them to
borrow on a standby  revolving  credit basis on and after the date hereof and at
any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date an aggregate principal
amount not in excess of $1,000,000,000 at any time outstanding. The Lenders have
also been  requested to provide a procedure  pursuant to which the Borrowers may
invite the Lenders to bid on an  uncommitted  basis on short-term  borrowings by
the  Borrowers.  The  proceeds  of such  borrowings  are to be used for  working
capital  and other  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  repayment  of
maturing commercial paper. The Lenders are willing to extend credit on the terms
and subject to the conditions herein set forth.

                  Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                                 ARTICLE I

                                                DEFINITIONS

                  SECTION 1.01.  Defined Terms. As used in this  Agreement,  the
following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

                  "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

                  "ABR Loan" shall mean any ABR Standby Loan.

                  "ABR  Standby  Loan"  shall  mean  any  Standby  Loan  bearing
interest  at a rate  determined  by  reference  to the  Alternate  Base  Rate in
accordance with the provisions of Article II.

                  "Administrative  Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 2.06(c).

                  "Administrative  Questionnaire"  shall mean an  Administrative
Questionnaire  in the form  distributed  to the  Lenders  by the  Administrative
Agent.

                  "Affiliate"  shall mean, when used with respect to a specified
person,  another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by
or is under common control with the person specified.

                  "Agents" shall mean the  Co-Administrative  Agents,  including
JPMorgan Chase Bank as Administrative Agent.

                  "Agreement  Currency" shall have the meaning  assigned to such
term in Section 9.16(b).

                  "Alternate  Base  Rate"  shall  mean,  for any day, a rate per
annum  (rounded  upwards,  if  necessary,  to the next  1/16 of 1%) equal to the
greater  of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the  Federal  Funds
Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For purposes hereof, "Prime
Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly  announced from time to
time by the  Administrative  Agent as its prime rate in effect at its  principal
office in New York City; each change in the Prime Rate shall be effective on the
date such change is publicly  announced as effective.  "Federal Funds  Effective
Rate" shall mean,  for any day, the  weighted  average of the rates on overnight
Federal funds  transactions  with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged
by Federal funds brokers, as released on the next succeeding Business Day by the
Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York,  or, if such rate is not so released for any
day which is a Business Day, the arithmetic average (rounded upwards to the next
1/100th of 1%), as determined by the Administrative Agent, of the quotations for
the day of such  transactions  received by the  Administrative  Agent from three
Federal funds brokers of recognized  standing  selected by it. If for any reason
the  Administrative  Agent shall have determined (which  determination  shall be
conclusive  absent  manifest  error) that it is unable to ascertain  the Federal
Funds  Effective Rate for any reason,  including the inability or failure of the
Administrative  Agent to obtain  sufficient  quotations in  accordance  with the
terms  thereof,  the Alternate  Base Rate shall be determined  without regard to
clause (b) of the first  sentence  of this  definition  until the  circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist.  Any change in the Alternate Base
Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall
be  effective  on the  effective  date of such  change in the Prime  Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

                  "Second Amended and Restated  Agreement  Effective Date" shall
mean the date on which the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied.

                  "Annual  Statement" shall mean, with respect to the Restricted
Subsidiaries,  the Annual Statement of such Restricted Subsidiary required to be
filed with the  Applicable  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority in accordance  with
state law, including any exhibits, schedules, certificates or actuarial opinions
filed or delivered therewith.

                  "Applicable  Insurance Regulatory  Authority" shall mean, with
respect  to any  Insurance  Subsidiary,  the  insurance  commission  or  similar
Governmental  Authority located in the state in which such Insurance  Subsidiary
is domiciled and any Federal insurance Governmental Authority.

                  "Applicable  Percentage"  shall mean on any date, with respect
to Eurocurrency  Standby Loans, with respect to the Facility Fee or with respect
to the Usage Fee, as the case may be, the applicable  percentage set forth below
under the caption "Eurocurrency Spread", "Facility Fee Percentage" or "Usage Fee
Percentage", as the case may be, based upon the Ratings in effect on such date:

                  For purposes of the  foregoing,  (i) if either  Moody's or S&P
shall not have in  effect a Rating  (other  than by reason of the  circumstances
referred to in the last  sentence of this  definition),  then such Rating Agency
shall be deemed to have  established a Rating in Category 5; (ii) if the Ratings
established  or deemed to have been  established  by Moody's  and S&P shall fall
within  different  Categories,  the Applicable  Percentage shall be based on the
lower of the two Ratings unless the Ratings differ by two or more Categories, in
which case the Applicable  Percentage  will be based upon the Category one level
above the Category  corresponding to the lower Rating;  and (iii) if the Ratings
established  or deemed  to have been  established  by  Moody's  and S&P shall be
changed  (other than as a result of a change in the rating  system of Moody's or
S&P),  such  change  shall  be  effective  as of the  date on  which it is first
announced  by the  applicable  Rating  Agency.  Each  change  in the  Applicable
Percentage  shall apply during the period  commencing on the  effective  date of
such change and ending on the date  immediately  preceding the effective date of
the next such change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if
either such Rating Agency shall cease to be in the business of rating  corporate
debt  obligations,  the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to
amend  this   definition   to  reflect  such  changed   rating   system  or  the
unavailability of ratings from such Rating Agency and, pending the effectiveness
of any  such  amendment,  the  Applicable  Percentage  shall  be  determined  by
reference  to the  Rating  most  recently  in  effect  prior to such  change  or
cessation.

                  "Assignment  and  Acceptance"  shall  mean an  assignment  and
acceptance entered into by a Lender and an assignee in the form of Exhibit B.

                  "Augmenting  Lender"  shall have the meaning  assigned to such

Borrowing  consisting of Standby Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Available Commitments; provided, however, that the failure
of any Lender to make any  Standby  Loan shall not in itself  relieve  any other
Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood,  however,  that
no Lender shall be  responsible  for the failure of any other Lender to make any
Loan required to be made by such other  Lender).  Each Local Currency Loan shall
be made as part of a Borrowing  consisting of Local  Currency  Loans made by the

Lender Maximum Borrowing  Amounts;  provided,  however,  that the failure of any
Local  Currency  Lender  to make any  Local  Currency  Loan  shall not in itself
relieve any other Local Currency  Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it
being  understood,  however,  that no Local Currency Lender shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Local  Currency  Lender to make any Local  Currency
Loan required to be made by such other Local Currency Lender).  Each Competitive

Currency  Loans,  in an  aggregate  principal  amount  which  complies  with the
requirements  set forth in the applicable Local Currency  Addendum.  All Standby
Loans  and  Competitive  Loans  made  pursuant  to  this  Article  II  shall  be

Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, and each Standby Borrowing
shall be comprised  entirely of Eurocurrency  Standby Loans or ABR Loans, as the
Borrower  may request  pursuant to Section  2.03 or 2.04,  as  applicable.  Each
Lender may at its option make any  Eurocurrency  Loan by causing any domestic or
foreign branch,  agency or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;  provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of
more than one Type may be  outstanding  at the same time.  For  purposes  of the
foregoing,  Loans having different Interest Periods,  regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

time,  credit the amounts so received to the account or accounts  specified from

Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any
condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts
so received to the respective  Lenders.  Competitive  Loans shall be made by the
Lender or Lenders  whose  Competitive  Bids  therefor are  accepted  pursuant to
Section 2.03 in the amounts so accepted.  Standby Loans and Local Currency Loans
shall be made by the Lenders and the Local Currency Lenders, as applicable,  pro
rata in accordance with Section 2.16. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received  notice  from a  Lender  prior  to the  date  (or,  in the  case of ABR
Borrowings,  on the  date)  of any  Borrowing  that  such  Lender  will not make
available to the  Administrative  Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that such  Lender  has made such  portion
available  to the  Administrative  Agent  on  the  date  of  such  Borrowing  in
accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon  such   assumption,   make  available  to  the  Borrower  on  such  date  a
corresponding  amount in the required  currency.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have made such portion available to the  Administrative  Agent,
such  Lender and the  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the  Administrative
Agent  forthwith on demand such  corresponding  amount  together  with  interest
thereon  in such  currency,  for each day from  the  date  such  amount  is made
available  to  the  Borrower  until  the  date  such  amount  is  repaid  to the
Administrative  Agent  at (i) in the case of the  Borrower,  the  interest  rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and

                                                                              17


(ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the  Administrative  Agent
to  represent  its cost of  overnight  funds.  If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative  Agent such  corresponding  amount,  such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (d) Each Competitive Loan shall be a Eurocurrency  Competitive
Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan.  Each  Standby Loan shall be a  Eurocurrency  Standby
Loan or an ABR Standby Loan.  Each Local  Currency Loan shall be a  Eurocurrency
Local Currency Loan or shall bear interest at a rate specified in the applicable
Loan Currency Addendum.

                  SECTION 2.03.  Competitive  Bid Procedure.  (a) Subject to the
terms  and  conditions  set  forth  herein,  from  time to time on or after  the
Effective Date and until the earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination of
the  Commitments,  the Borrower may request  Competitive Bids and may (but shall
not have any  obligation  to) accept  Competitive  Bids and  borrow  Competitive
Loans;  provided that the sum of the total  Standby  Credit  Exposures  plus the
aggregate  amount of the Competitive Loan Exposures at any time shall not exceed
the Total  Commitment.  In order to request  Competitive  Bids, a Borrower  (the
"Applicable  Borrower")  shall hand  deliver or telecopy  to the  Administrative
Agent a duly  completed  Competitive  Bid  Request  in the form of  Exhibit  A-1
hereto,  to be  received  by the  Administrative  Agent  (i) in  the  case  of a
Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan,  not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
four Business Days before a proposed Competitive  Borrowing and (ii) in the case
of a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  not later than 10:00 a.m.,  New York City time, one
Business  Day  before a  proposed  Competitive  Borrowing.  No ABR Loan shall be
requested in, or made pursuant to, a Competitive Bid Request.  A Competitive Bid
Request that does not conform  substantially to the format of Exhibit A-1 may be
rejected in the Administrative  Agent's sole discretion,  and the Administrative
Agent shall  promptly  notify the Borrower of such  rejection by telecopy.  Each
Competitive  Bid Request  shall refer to this  Agreement and specify (x) whether
the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurocurrency  Borrowing or a Fixed
Rate Borrowing,  (y) the date of such Borrowing  (which shall be a Business Day)
and the aggregate principal amount thereof which shall be in a minimum principal
amount of  $5,000,000  and in an integral  multiple of  $1,000,000,  and (z) the
Interest  Period  with  respect  thereto  (which may not end after the  Maturity
Date).  Promptly  after its receipt of a  Competitive  Bid  Request  that is not
rejected as aforesaid,  the Administrative Agent shall telecopy to the Lenders a
Notice of Competitive Bid Request  inviting the Lenders to bid, on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Loans.

                  (b) Each Lender  invited to bid may,  in its sole  discretion,
make one or more Competitive Bids to the Applicable  Borrower responsive to such
Borrower's  Competitive  Bid Request.  Each  Competitive Bid by a Lender must be
received by the  Administrative  Agent by  telecopy,  in the form of Exhibit A-3
hereto, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency  Competitive Loan, not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  three  Business  Days before a proposed  Competitive
Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  on the day of a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing.  A
Lender may submit multiple bids to the  Administrative  Agent.  Competitive Bids
that do not conform  substantially  to the format of Exhibit A-3 may be rejected
by the  Administrative  Agent,  and the  Administrative  Agent shall  notify the
Lender making such  nonconforming  bid of such rejection as soon as practicable.
Each Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the principal
amount (which shall be in a minimum  principal  amount of  $5,000,000  and in an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount
of the Competitive  Borrowing  requested) of the Competitive  Loan or Loans that
the Lender is willing to make,  (y) the  Competitive  Bid Rate or Rates at which
the  Lender is  prepared  to make the  Competitive  Loan or  Loans,  and (z) the
Interest  Period and the last day  thereof.  If any Lender  invited to bid shall
elect  not  to  make  a  Competitive  Bid,  such  Lender  shall  so  notify  the
Administrative  Agent by telecopy  (I) in the case of  Eurocurrency  Competitive
Loans,  not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before
a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing and (II) in the case of Fixed Rate Loans, not
later than 9:30 a.m.,  New York City time, on the day of a proposed  Competitive
Borrowing;  provided,  however,  that  failure by any Lender to give such notice
shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any

Competitive  Loan as  part of such  Competitive  Borrowing.  A  Competitive  Bid
submitted by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable.

                  (c) The Administrative  Agent shall as promptly as practicable
notify  the  Borrower,  by  telecopy,  of all the  Competitive  Bids  made,  the
Competitive  Bid Rate  and the  principal  amount  of each  Competitive  Loan in
respect of which a Competitive  Bid was made and the identity of the Lender that
made each bid.  The  Administrative  Agent shall send a copy of all  Competitive
Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as practicable  after completion of
the bidding process set forth in this Section 2.03.

                  (d) The  Borrower  may in its  sole and  absolute  discretion,
subject  only to the  provisions  of this  paragraph  (d),  accept or reject any
Competitive  Bid referred to in paragraph (c) above.  The Borrower  shall notify
the  Administrative  Agent by telephone,  confirmed by telecopy in the form of a
Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter,  whether and to what extent it has decided
to accept or reject any of or all the bids  referred to in  paragraph  (c) above
not more than one hour  after it shall  have been  notified  of such bids by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to such paragraph (c); provided, however, that (i)
the  failure  of the  Borrower  to give  such  notice  shall be  deemed  to be a
rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above;  (ii) the Borrower
shall  not  accept a bid  made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid Rate if it has
decided  to  reject  a bid  made at a lower  Competitive  Bid  Rate;  (iii)  the
aggregate  amount of the  Competitive  Bids  accepted by the Borrower  shall not
exceed the principal  amount  specified in the Competitive Bid Request;  (iv) if
the Borrower  shall accept a bid or bids made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid
Rate but the amount of such bid or bids shall cause the total  amount of bids to
be accepted to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request,  then
the  Borrower  shall  accept a portion of such bid or bids in an amount equal to
the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of all other
Competitive  Bids accepted with respect to such  Competitive Bid Request,  which
acceptance,  in the case of multiple bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be
made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid at such Competitive
Bid Rate; and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no bid shall be accepted
for a Competitive Loan unless such  Competitive  Loan is in a minimum  principal
amount of $5,000,000 and an integral  multiple of $1,000,000;  provided further,
however,  that if a Competitive  Loan must be in an amount less than  $5,000,000
because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for
a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the
pro rata  allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a particular
Competitive  Bid Rate  pursuant to clause  (iv) the amounts  shall be rounded to
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of
the  Borrower.   A  notice  given  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  (d)  shall  be
irrevocable.

                  (e)  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  each

bidding Lender whether or not its  Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so,
in what  amount  and at  what  Competitive  Bid  Rate)  by  telecopy,  and  each
successful  bidder will thereupon become bound,  subject to the other applicable
conditions  hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has
been accepted.

                  (f) No  Competitive  Borrowing  shall  be  requested  or  made
hereunder  if after giving  effect  thereto any of the  conditions  set forth in
paragraph (c) of Section 2.01 would not be met.

                  (g) If the  Administrative  Agent  shall  elect  to  submit  a
Competitive  Bid in its capacity as a Lender,  it shall submit such bid directly
to the  Applicable  Borrower one quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time
at  which  the  other   Lenders  are  required  to  submit  their  bids  to  the
Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above.

                  (h) All notices  required by this  Section 2.03 shall be given
in accordance with Section 9.01.

                  SECTION 2.04. Standby and Local Currency Borrowing  Procedure.
(a) In order to request a Standby  Borrowing,  a Borrower  shall hand deliver or
telecopy to the Administrative  Agent a duly completed Standby Borrowing Request
in the form of Exhibit A-5 (i) in the case of a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan, not
later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time (or, if the Standby  Borrowing request
is delivered or telecopied  to the  Administrative  Agent in London,  9:30 a.m.,
London time), three Business Days before such Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of
an ABR  Borrowing,  not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the day of
such  Borrowing.  No Fixed Rate Loan shall be  requested  or made  pursuant to a
Standby  Borrowing  Request.  Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each
case  specify  (A)  whether  the  Borrowing  then  being  requested  is  to be a
Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan or an ABR  Borrowing;  (B) the date of such  Standby
Borrowing  (which shall be a Business  Day) and the amount  thereof;  and (C) if
such  Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency  Standby Loan, the Interest  Period with
respect thereto,  which shall not end after the Maturity Date. If no election as
to the Type of Standby  Borrowing  is  specified  in any such  notice,  then the
requested  Standby  Borrowing  shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period
with respect to any  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan is specified in any such notice,
then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have  selected an Interest  Period of one
month's duration.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,  no Standby  Borrowing  shall be requested if the Interest Period with
respect  thereto would end after the Maturity  Date.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall  promptly  advise each of the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this
Section 2.04 and of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.

                  (b) In order to request a Local Currency Borrowing, a Borrower
shall give the notice required under the applicable Local Currency  Addendum and
shall simultaneously deliver a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 2.05.  Conversion and  Continuation  of Standby Loans.
         Each Borrower  shall have the right at any time upon prior  irrevocable
         notice to the  Administrative  Agent (i) not later than 10:30 a.m., New
         York City time,  on the day of the  conversion,  to convert  all or any
         part of any Eurocurrency Standby Loan into an ABR Standby Loan and (ii)
         not later than 10:30  a.m.,  New York City time,  three  Business  Days
         prior to  conversion or  continuation,  to convert any ABR Standby Loan
         into a  Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan  or to  continue  any  Eurocurrency
         Standby Loan as a Eurocurrency  Standby Loan for an additional Interest
         Period, subject in each case to the following:

                  (a) if less than all the outstanding  principal  amount of any
         Standby  Borrowing  shall be  converted  or  continued,  the  aggregate
         principal amount of the Standby Borrowing  converted or continued shall
         be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000;

                  (b)  accrued  interest  on a  Standby  Borrowing  (or  portion
         thereof) being  converted  shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of
         conversion;

                  (c) if any  Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan is converted at a time
         other  than the end of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  the
         Borrower  shall  pay,  upon  demand,  any  amounts  due to the  Lenders
         pursuant to Section 2.15;

                  (d) any portion of a Standby Borrowing maturing or required to
         be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued
         as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan;

                  (e) any portion of a Eurocurrency Standby Loan which cannot be
         continued as a Eurocurrency  Standby Loan by reason of clause (d) above
         shall be  automatically  converted at the end of the Interest Period in
         effect for such Eurocurrency Standby Loan into an ABR Borrowing;

                  (f) no Interest  Period may be selected  for any  Eurocurrency
         Standby Borrowing that would end later than the Maturity Date; and


<PAGE>
                                                                              20


                  (g)  at  any  time  when  there  shall  have  occurred  and be
         continuing  any  Default  or  Event of  Default,  no  Borrowing  may be
         converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan.

                  Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be irrevocable
and shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of the
Standby  Borrowing  to be  converted  or  continued;  (ii)  whether such Standby
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan or
an ABR Standby Loan;  (iii) if such notice  requests a  conversion,  the date of
such  conversion  (which  shall be a  Business  Day);  and (iv) if such  Standby
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan, the
Interest Period with respect thereto.  If no Interest Period is specified in any
such notice with respect to any conversion to or  continuation as a Eurocurrency
Standby Loan, the Borrower  shall be deemed to have selected an Interest  Period
of one month's  duration.  If no notice shall have been given in accordance with
this  Section 2.05 to convert or continue  any Standby  Borrowing,  such Standby
Borrowing  shall, at the end of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto (unless
repaid  pursuant to the terms  hereof),  automatically  be continued  into a new
Interest Period as an ABR Standby Loan.

                  SECTION  2.06.  Fees.  (a) The  Company  agrees  to pay to the
Administrative  Agent  for the  account  of each  Lender  a  facility  fee  (the
"Facility  Fee"),  which shall accrue at the Applicable  Percentage from time to
time in effect on the daily  amount of the  Commitment  of such Lender  (whether
used or unused)  during the period  from and  including  the date  hereof to but
excluding the date on which such Commitment  terminates;  provided that, if such
Lender  continues  to have any  Standby  Credit  Exposure  after its  Commitment
terminates,  then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount
of such Lender's  Standby  Credit  Exposure from and including the date on which
its Commitment  terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases
to have any Standby Credit  Exposure.  Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March,  June,  September  and  December of each year,
commencing  on the first such date to occur  after the date  hereof,  and on the
date on which the  Commitments  shall have terminated and the Lenders shall have
no further Standby Credit Exposures.  All Facility Fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable  for the actual  number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (b) For any day on which the aggregate  Dollar  Equivalents of
the  outstanding  principal  amounts of Loans  shall be greater  than 50% of the
Total  Commitment  (and for any day after the termination of all the Commitments
on  which  Loans  shall  be   outstanding),   the  Company   shall  pay  to  the
Administrative  Agent for the  account  of each  Lender a usage fee (the  "Usage
Fee") at the Applicable  Percentage from time to time in effect on the aggregate
Dollar  Equivalents of the outstanding  principal amounts of each Lender's Loans
on such day. Accrued and unpaid Usage Fees, if any, shall be payable on the last
day of each March,  June,  September  and  December and on the date on which the
Commitments  shall have  terminated and the Lenders shall have no Standby Credit
Exposures.  All Usage Fees shall be  computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed  (including the first
day but excluding the last day).

                  (c) The Company agrees to pay each Agent, for its own account,
the  administrative  and other fees separately agreed to by the Company and such
Agent (the "Administrative Fees").

                  (d) All Fees  shall be paid on the dates due,  in  immediately
available  funds,  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for  distribution,  if and as
appropriate,  among the Lenders,  except that the  Administrative  Fees shall be
paid  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c) above.  Once paid,  none of the Fees shall be
refundable under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.07.  Repayment of Loans;  Evidence of Debt. (a) Each
Borrower  hereby agrees that the outstanding  principal  balance of each Standby
Loan or Local  Currency  Loan shall be payable on the  Maturity  Date (unless an
earlier date is specified in the Local Currency

<PAGE>
                                                                              21


Addendum  relating  to such  Local  Currency  Loan)  and  that  the  outstanding
principal  balance of each  Competitive Loan shall be payable on the last day of
the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto.  Each Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.08.

                  (b) Each Lender shall  maintain in  accordance  with its usual
practice  an account or  accounts  evidencing  the  indebtedness  to such Lender
resulting  from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,  including  the
amounts of principal  and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

                  (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall (i) maintain  accounts in
which it will record (A) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the currency of
each  Loan,  the  Borrower  of each  Loan,  the Type of each  Loan  made and the
Interest Period applicable thereto;  (B) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable  from each  Borrower to each Lender
hereunder;  and (C) the amount of any sum received by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder  from each Borrower and each Lender's share thereof and (ii) provide a
summary to the Company in writing on a quarterly basis.

                  (d) The entries  made in the accounts  maintained  pursuant to
paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this Section 2.07 shall,  to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law, be prima facie  evidence  of the  existence  and amounts of the
obligations therein recorded;  provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the  obligations of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

                  SECTION 2.08. Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to the provisions
of Section 2.09, the Loans  comprising  each  Eurocurrency  Borrowing shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days) at a rate per annum  equal to (i) in the case of each  Eurocurrency
Standby Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable  Percentage from time to time in effect; (ii) in the case of
each  Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest  Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Margin offered by the Lender making such Loan
and accepted by the Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.03; and (iii) in the case of
each Eurocurrency  Local Currency Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Loan plus any spread  specified in the applicable Local Currency
Addendum (or, if no such spread shall be specified,  the  Applicable  Percentage
from time to time in effect).

                  (b)  Subject  to the  provisions  of Section  2.09,  the Loans
comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest  (computed on the basis of the
actual  number of days elapsed  over a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, for periods  during which the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference
to the Prime Rate and 360 days for other  periods)  at a rate per annum equal to
the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, each Fixed Rate
Loan  shall  bear  interest  at a rate per annum  (computed  on the basis of the
actual  number of days  elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the fixed rate
of interest  offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.03.

                  (d)  Subject  to the  provisions  of Section  2.09,  any Local
Currency Loan that is not a Eurocurrency Loan shall bear interest at the rate or
rates per annum set forth in the applicable Local Currency Addendum.

                  (e)  Interest  on each Loan shall be payable on each  Interest
Payment  Date  applicable  to such Loan  except as  otherwise  provided  in this
Agreement or in an applicable Local Currency Addendum.  The applicable LIBO Rate
or  Alternate  Base  Rate for each  Interest  Period or day  within an  Interest
Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the Administrative
<PAGE>
                                                                              22

Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.09. Default Interest. If a Borrower shall default in
the payment of the  principal  of or  interest  on any Loan or any other  amount
becoming due  hereunder,  whether by scheduled  maturity,  notice of prepayment,
acceleration or otherwise,  such Borrower shall on demand from time to time from
the Administrative  Agent pay interest,  to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted  amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before  judgment)  at a rate per annum  (computed as provided in Section
2.08(b))  equal to the  Alternate  Base Rate  plus 2% (or,  in the case of Local
Currency  Loans,  such other rate as may be  specified in the  applicable  Local
Currency Addendum).

                  SECTION 2.10. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on
each occasion,  that on the day two Business Days prior to the  commencement  of
any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall
have  commercially  reasonably  determined (i) that deposits in the currency and
principal  amounts of the  Eurocurrency  Loans comprising such Borrowing are not
generally  available in the London market or (ii) that  reasonable  means do not
exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as
practicable  thereafter,  give  telecopy  notice  of such  determination  to the
Company  and  applicable  Borrower  and the  Lenders.  In the  event of any such
determination  under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the  Administrative  Agent
shall have  advised the Company and the Lenders  that the  circumstances  giving
rise to such  notice  no longer  exist,  (x) any  request  by a  Borrower  for a
Eurocurrency  Competitive Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be of no force and
effect and shall be denied by the  Administrative  Agent,  (y) any  request by a
Borrower for a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan pursuant to Section  2.04(a) shall be
deemed  to be a  request  for  an  ABR  Borrowing  and  (z)  any  request  for a
Eurocurrency  Local  Currency  Loan  pursuant to Section  2.04(b) and to a Local
Currency  Addendum  shall be deemed to be a request  for a Local  Currency  Loan
bearing  interest by reference to the rate  specified  in the  applicable  Local
Currency Addendum  (provided that if the requested  Eurocurrency  Local Currency
Loan was to be made  pursuant to a Local  Currency  Addendum in which no rate is
specified  such  request  shall be of no force and effect and shall be denied by
the  Administrative  Agent).  In the  event  the  Required  Lenders  notify  the
Administrative  Agent that the rates at which Dollar  deposits are being offered
will not  adequately  and fairly  reflect the cost to such  Lenders of making or
maintaining  Eurocurrency  Loans in Dollars  during such  Interest  Period,  the
Administrative  Agent shall  notify the  applicable  Borrower of such notice and
until the Required Lenders shall have advised the Administrative  Agent that the
circumstances  giving rise to such notice no longer  exist,  any request by such
Borrower  for a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan shall be deemed a request for an ABR
Borrowing.  Each  determination by the  Administrative  Agent hereunder shall be
made in good faith and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.11.  Termination and Reduction of  Commitments.  (a)
The Commitments shall be automatically terminated on the Maturity Date.

                  (b) Upon at  least  three  Business  Days'  prior  irrevocable
telecopy  notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Company may at any time in
whole permanently  terminate,  or from time to time in part permanently  reduce,
the Total Commitment;  provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the
Total  Commitment  shall be in an  integral  multiple  of  $10,000,000  and in a
minimum  principal  amount  of  $50,000,000  and  (ii)  no such  termination  or
reduction shall be made (A) which would reduce the Total Commitment to an amount
less than the sum of the aggregate  Standby Credit Exposures and the Competitive
Loan  Exposures or (B) which would reduce any Lender's  Commitment  to an amount
that is less than such Lender's Standby Credit Exposure.

                  (c) Each reduction in the Total Commitment  hereunder shall be
made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective  Commitments.
The  Borrowers  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account  of the
Lenders,  on the date of each reduction or termination of the Total  Commitment,
the Facility Fees on the amount of the  Commitments  terminated  accrued through
the date of such termination or reduction.

                  SECTION 2.12.  Prepayment.  (a) Each  Borrower  shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Standby Borrowing or Local
Currency  Borrowing,  as the case may be,  in  whole  or in  part,  upon  giving
telecopy  notice (or  telephone  notice  promptly  confirmed by telecopy) to the
Administrative  Agent: (i) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business
Days prior to prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Standby Loans; (ii) before
10:00 a.m.,  New York City time,  one Business Day prior to  prepayment,  in the
case of ABR Standby  Loans;  and (iii) in the case of Local Currency  Loans,  by
such time as shall be  specified  in the  applicable  Local  Currency  Addendum;
provided,  however,  that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is
(x) in the case of any Standby  Borrowing,  an integral  multiple of $10,000,000
and not  less  than  $50,000,000,  and (ii) in the  case of any  Local  Currency
Borrowing,  an amount in which  prepayments  are  permitted to be made under the
applicable Local Currency Addendum.  No prepayment may be made in respect of any
Competitive Borrowing.

                  (b) On  the  date  of  any  termination  or  reduction  of the
Commitments  pursuant to Section 2.11, the Borrowers shall pay or prepay so much
of the Standby  Borrowings  as shall be  necessary  in order that the sum of the
Competitive  Loan  Exposures and Standby  Credit  Exposures  will not exceed the
Total Commitment, after giving effect to such termination or reduction.

                  (c) Each notice of  prepayment  shall  specify the  prepayment
date and the  principal  amount of each  Borrowing  (or  portion  thereof) to be
prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the applicable Borrower to prepay
such  Borrowing (or portion  thereof) by the amount  stated  therein on the date
stated  therein.  All  prepayments  under this  Section 2.12 shall be subject to
Section 2.15 but otherwise  without premium or penalty.  All  prepayments  under
this  Section 2.12 shall be  accompanied  by accrued  interest on the  principal
amount being prepaid to the date of payment.

                  SECTION 2.13. Reserve  Requirements;  Change in Circumstances.
(a)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  herein,  if after  the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  (whether or not having the force of
law)  shall  result in the  imposition,  modification  or  applicability  of any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of or credit  extended by any Lender,  or shall result in the
imposition  on (i) any  Lender  or the  London  interbank  market  of any  other
condition affecting this Agreement;  (ii) such Lender's Commitment; or (iii) any
Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan made by such Lender,  and the result of any
of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such  Lender  of making or
maintaining any Eurocurrency  Loan or Fixed Rate Loan or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender  hereunder  (whether of principal,
interest  or  otherwise)  by an amount  reasonably  deemed by such  Lender to be
material,  then such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such  additional  costs or reduction  will be paid by the  Borrowers to such
Lender upon demand.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no Lender shall be entitled
to request  compensation  under this paragraph  with respect to any  Competitive
Loan if the change giving rise to such request was  applicable to such Lender at
the time of submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Competitive
Loan was made.

                  (b) If any Lender shall have  determined  that the adoption of
any law,  rule,  regulation or guideline  arising out of the July 1988 report of
the Basle Committee on Banking  Regulations and Supervisory  Practices  entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law,  rule,  regulation or guideline
regarding  capital  adequacy,  or any change in any of the  foregoing  or in the
interpretation  or  administration  of any of the foregoing by any  Governmental
Authority,  central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration  thereof,  or compliance by any Lender (or any lending  office of
such  Lender) or any  Lender's  holding  company  with any request or  directive
regarding  capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority,  central bank or comparable  agency,  has or would have the effect of
reducing  the rate of return on (i) such  Lender's  capital or on the capital of
such Lender's holding company, if


<PAGE>
                                                                              24

any, as a consequence of this Agreement; (ii) such Lender's Commitment; or (iii)
the Loans made by such Lender  pursuant  hereto to a level below that which such
Lender  or such  Lender's  holding  company  could  have  achieved  but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies
and the  policies  of such  Lender's  holding  company  with  respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount  reasonably  deemed by such Lender to be  material,  then
from time to time such  additional  amount or  amounts as will  compensate  such
Lender for such reduction will be paid by the Borrowers to such Lender.

                  (c) A certificate  of any Lender  setting forth such amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding  company,
as applicable,  as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above,  as the case may be,
shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The  Borrowers  shall  pay  such  Lender  the  amount  shown  as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

                  (d)  Failure on the part of any Lender to demand  compensation
for any  increased  costs or  reduction  in amounts  received or  receivable  or
reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period
or any other  period;  provided,  however,  that no Lender  shall be entitled to
compensation  under  this  Section  2.13 for any costs  incurred  or  reductions
suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the Company that
it will demand  compensation  for such costs or reductions  under  paragraph (c)
above not more  than 90 days  after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date
on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions.  The protection
of this Section  shall be available  to each Lender  regardless  of any possible
contention of the invalidity or  inapplicability  of the law, rule,  regulation,
guideline  or other  change or  condition  which  shall  have  occurred  or been
imposed.

                  SECTION  2.14.  Change in Legality.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any
other  provision  herein,  if any  change  in any  law or  regulation  or in the
interpretation   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
administration or  interpretation  thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
or any of its Affiliates  which shall be party to a Local  Currency  Addendum to
make or maintain any Eurocurrency  Loan or Local Currency Loan or to give effect
to its obligations as contemplated  hereby with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan
or Local  Currency Loan, or shall limit the  convertibility  into Dollars of any
Local Currency (or make such conversion  commercially  impracticable),  then, by
written notice to the Company and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

                  (i) declare that  Eurocurrency  Loans or Loans in any affected
         Local  Currency will not  thereafter be made by such Lender  hereunder,
         whereupon such Lender shall not submit a Competitive Bid in response to
         a request  for a  Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan,  any  request  for a
         Eurocurrency  Standby Loan shall,  as to such Lender only,  be deemed a
         request for an ABR Loan, and any request for a Local Currency Borrowing
         in such Local Currency shall be  disregarded,  unless such  declaration
         shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                  (ii)  require  that  all  outstanding  Eurocurrency  Loans  in
         Dollars made by it be  converted to ABR Loans and that all  outstanding
         Local  Currency  Loans made by it in the  affected  Local  Currency  be
         promptly prepaid, in which event all such Eurocurrency Loans in Dollars
         shall be automatically  converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date
         of such notice as provided  in  paragraph  (b) below and all such Local
         Currency Loans shall be promptly prepaid.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above  with  respect  to  Eurocurrency  Loans  in  Dollars,   all  payments  and
prepayments  of principal  which would  otherwise have been applied to repay the
Eurocurrency  Loans that would  have been made by such  Lender or the  converted
Eurocurrency  Loans,  of such Lender  shall  instead be applied to repay the ABR
Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting  from the conversion of, such
Eurocurrency

                                                                              25

Loans.

                  (b) For purposes of this Section  2.14, a notice by any Lender
shall be effective  as to each  Eurocurrency  Loan or Local  Currency  Loan,  if
lawful,  on the last day of the Interest  Period  currently  applicable  to such
Eurocurrency  Loan or Local  Currency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall
be effective on the date of receipt.

                  SECTION 2.15.  Indemnity.  The Borrowers  shall indemnify each
Lender against any  out-of-pocket  loss or expense which such Lender sustains or
incurs as a consequence of (a) any failure to borrow or to refinance, convert or
continue  any  Loan  hereunder  after  irrevocable  notice  of  such  borrowing,
refinancing, conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03,
2.04 or 2.05 or  pursuant  to any  Local  Currency  Addendum;  (b) any  payment,
prepayment  or  conversion,  or  assignment  required  under  Section 2.20, of a
Eurocurrency Loan required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise
made or deemed made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period, if
any,  applicable  thereto;  (c) any  default  in payment  or  prepayment  of the
principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as
and  when  due and  payable  (at the due  date  thereof,  whether  by  scheduled
maturity,  acceleration,  irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise); or (d)
the occurrence of any Event of Default,  including,  in each such case, any loss
or  reasonable  expense  sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in
liquidating  or  employing  deposits  from third  parties  acquired to effect or
maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurocurrency  Loan or Local Currency
Loan.  Such loss or  reasonable  expense  shall  include an amount  equal to the
excess,  if any, as  reasonably  determined  by such Lender,  of (i) its cost of
obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, refinanced or not borrowed
(assumed to be the LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of
such payment,  prepayment,  refinancing or failure to borrow or refinance to the
last day of the  Interest  Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow or refinance the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced
on the date of such  failure)  over (ii) the amount of interest  (as  reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in  reemploying
the funds so paid,  prepaid or not  borrowed  or  refinanced  for such period or
Interest  Period,  as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth
any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive  pursuant to this
Section  shall be delivered  to such  Borrower  and shall be  conclusive  absent
manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.16.  Pro Rata  Treatment.  Except as required  under
Sections  2.14 and 2.20,  each payment or prepayment of principal of any Standby
Borrowing,  each payment of interest on the Standby  Loans,  each payment of the
Facility Fees, each payment of the Usage Fees, each reduction of the Commitments
and each  refinancing  or  conversion  of any Standby  Borrowing  with a Standby
Borrowing  of any  Type,  shall be  allocated  pro rata  among  the  Lenders  in
accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have
expired or been terminated,  in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of  their  outstanding   Standby  Loans).  Each  payment  of  principal  of  any
Competitive   Borrowing   shall  be   allocated   pro  rata  among  the  Lenders
participating  in such  Borrowing in accordance  with the  respective  principal
amounts of their outstanding  Competitive Loans comprising such Borrowing.  Each
payment of interest on any  Competitive  Borrowing  shall be allocated  pro rata
among  the  Lenders  participating  in such  Borrowing  in  accordance  with the
respective   amounts  of  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  on  their  outstanding
Competitive  Loans  comprising such  Borrowing.  For purposes of determining the
Available  Commitments of the Lenders at any time, each outstanding  Competitive
Borrowing  shall be deemed  to have  utilized  the  Commitments  of the  Lenders
(including  those  Lenders  which  shall  not  have  made  Loans as part of such
Competitive Borrowing) pro rata in accordance with such respective  Commitments.
Each Lender agrees that in computing  such Lender's  portion of any Borrowing to
be made hereunder,  the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion,  round each
Lender's  percentage of such  Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar
amount.

                  SECTION 2.17.  Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Lender agrees that if
it  shall,  through  the  exercise  of a  right  of  banker's  lien,  setoff  or
counterclaim,  or pursuant to a secured  claim under  Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United  States Code or other  security or interest  arising from, or in


<PAGE>
                                                                              26

lieu of,  such  secured  claim,  received by such  Lender  under any  applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means,
obtain  payment  (voluntary  or  involuntary)  in respect of any Standby Loan or
Loans as a result of which the unpaid  principal  portion of its  Standby  Loans
shall be  proportionately  less than the unpaid principal portion of the Standby
Loans of any other Lender,  it shall be deemed  simultaneously to have purchased
from such  other  Lender at face  value,  and shall  promptly  pay to such other
Lender the  purchase  price for, a  participation  in the Standby  Loans of such
other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Standby Loans
and participations in the Standby Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same
proportion to the aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount of all Standby Loans then
outstanding as the principal  amount of its Standby Loans prior to such exercise
of banker's  lien,  setoff or  counterclaim  or other event was to the principal
amount of all Standby Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien,
setoff or  counterclaim  or other event;  provided,  however,  that, if any such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17
and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase
or purchases or  adjustments  shall be rescinded to the extent of such  recovery
and the purchase price or prices or adjustment  restored without  interest.  Any
Lender  holding  a  participation  in a  Standby  Loan  deemed  to have  been so
purchased  may  exercise  any  and  all  rights  of  banker's  lien,  setoff  or
counterclaim  with  respect to any and all moneys owing to such Lender by reason
thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Standby Loan in the amount of such
participation.

                  SECTION  2.18.  Payments.  (a) The  Borrowers  shall make each
payment  (including  principal of or interest on any  Borrowing  and any Fees or
other  amounts)  hereunder  from an account in the United  States not later than
12:00 noon,  local time at the place of payment,  on the date when due,  without
setoff or  counterclaim,  in immediately  available funds to the  Administrative
Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue,  New York, New York (or, in the case of
Local  Currency  Loans,  such other time and place as shall be  specified in the
applicable Local Currency Addendum).  Each such payment (other than principal of
and interest on Local  Currency  Loans which shall be made in the Local Currency
of such Local Currency Loan) shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b) Whenever any payment  (including  principal of or interest
on any Borrowing or any Fees or other  amounts)  hereunder  shall become due, or
otherwise  would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be
made on the next  succeeding  Business Day, and such  extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

                  SECTION 2.19.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments to the Lenders
hereunder  shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.18, free and clear of and
without  deduction  for any and all current or future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,
deductions,  charges or withholdings,  and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding (i) income taxes imposed on the income of the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender (or any  transferee or assignee  thereof,  including a  participation
holder (any such entity a "Transferee")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the
income,  assets or net worth of the  Administrative  Agent,  or any  Lender  (or
Transferee),  in each  case by the  jurisdiction  under  the laws of  which  the
Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  (or  Transferee)  is  organized  or doing
business (other than as a result of entering into this Agreement, performing any
obligations hereunder,  receiving any payments hereunder or enforcing any rights
hereunder),  or any political  subdivision  thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively
or individually, "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes
from  or in  respect  of any  sum  payable  hereunder  to  any  Lender  (or  any
Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased
by the amount  (an  "additional  amount")  necessary  so that  after  making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.19) such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent
(as the case may be)  shall  receive  an amount  equal to the sum it would  have
received had no such  deductions  been made;  (ii) such Borrower shall make such
deductions;  and (iii) such Borrower  shall pay the full amount  deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in

<PAGE>
                                                                              27


accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In  addition,  the  Borrowers  shall  pay to the  relevant
Governmental  Authority in accordance  with applicable law any current or future
stamp or  documentary  taxes or any other excise or property  taxes,  charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document ("Other Taxes").

                  (c) The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender (or Transferee),
and the  Administrative  Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes paid
by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, as the case may be,
and  any  liability  (including  penalties,  interest  and  expenses  (including
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses))  arising  therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Taxes or Other  Taxes  were  correctly  or legally
asserted by the relevant Governmental  Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such  payment  or  liability  prepared  by a Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent on its  behalf,  absent  manifest  error,  shall be final,
conclusive  and binding for all  purposes.  Such  indemnification  shall be made
within 30 days after the date any Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand  therefor,  which written demand
shall be made  within 60 days of the date such  Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent receives written demand for payment of such Taxes or Other
Taxes from the relevant Governmental Authority.

                  (d) If a Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent
shall  become  aware that it is entitled  to claim a refund from a  Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
by the Borrowers,  or with respect to which the Borrowers  have paid  additional
amounts,  pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly  notify the Borrowers
of the availability of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt
of a request by the Borrowers,  make a claim to such Governmental  Authority for
such  refund at the  Borrowers'  expense.  If a Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative Agent receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund
made pursuant to the preceding  sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been  indemnified  by the  Borrowers or with respect to which
the Borrowers  have paid  additional  amounts  pursuant to this Section 2.19, it
shall  within 30 days from the date of such  receipt pay over such refund to the
Borrowers  (but only to the extent of indemnity  payments  made,  or  additional
amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
such Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent and without  interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund);  provided,  however, that the Borrowers,  upon the request of such
Lender (or Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent,  agree to repay the amount
paid over to the Borrowers (plus  penalties,  interest or other charges) to such
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent in the event such Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority.

                  (e) As soon as  practicable  after the date of any  payment of
Taxes or Other Taxes by the  Borrowers to the relevant  Governmental  Authority,
the Borrowers will deliver to the Administrative  Agent, at its address referred
to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing payment thereof.

                  (f) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations  contained in this Section 2.19
shall  survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans
made hereunder.

                  (g) Each Lender (or  Transferee)  that is organized  under the
laws of a jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  any State thereof or the
District of Columbia (a "Non-U.S.  Lender") shall deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service
Form  W-8BEN or Form  W-8ECI,  or,  in the case of a  Non-U.S.  Lender  claiming
exemption from U.S.  Federal  withholding  tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of
the Code

<PAGE>
                                                                              28


with  respect  to  payments  of  "portfolio  interest",  a Form  W-8BEN,  or any
subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S.  Lender
delivers a Form W-8BEN, a certificate  representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is
not a bank for  purposes  of  Section  881(c) of the Code,  is not a 10  percent
shareholder  (within  the  meaning of Section  871(h)(3)(B)  of the Code) of the
Company  and is not a  controlled  foreign  corporation  related to the  Company
(within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)),  properly  completed and
duly executed by such  Non-U.S.  Lender  claiming  complete  exemption  from, or
reduced rate of, U.S.  Federal  withholding tax on payments by the Company under
this  Agreement.  Such forms shall be  delivered by each  Non-U.S.  Lender on or
before  the date it  becomes  a party to this  Agreement  (or,  in the case of a
Transferee  that  is  a  participation  holder,  on  or  before  the  date  such
participation holder becomes a Transferee  hereunder) and on or before the date,
if  any,  such  Non-U.S.   Lender  changes  its  applicable  lending  office  by
designating a different  lending office (a "New Lending  Office").  In addition,
each Non-U.S.  Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or
invalidity  of  any  form   previously   delivered  by  such  Non-U.S.   Lender.
Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Section 2.19(g), a Non-U.S.  Lender
shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section  2.19(g) that
such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

                  (h) The  Borrowers  shall not be  required  to  indemnify  any
Non-U.S.  Lender,  or to pay any additional  amounts to any Non-U.S.  Lender, in
respect of United States  Federal  withholding  tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or
(c) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect
to United  States  Federal  withholding  tax  existed on the date such  Non-U.S.
Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is
a  participation  holder,  on  the  date  such  participation  holder  became  a
Transferee  hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the
date such Non-U.S.  Lender  designated such New Lending Office with respect to a
Loan; provided,  however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to any Transferee
or New  Lending  Office that  becomes a  Transferee  or New Lending  Office as a
result of an  assignment,  participation,  transfer or  designation  made at the
request of the Company;  and  provided  further,  however,  that this clause (i)
shall not apply to the extent the indemnity  payment or  additional  amounts any
Transferee,  or Lender (or Transferee)  through a New Lending  Office,  would be
entitled  to  receive  (without  regard to this  clause  (i)) do not  exceed the
indemnity  payment or additional  amounts that the person making the assignment,
participation or transfer to such Transferee,  or Lender (or Transferee)  making
the designation of such New Lending Office,  would have been entitled to receive
in the absence of such  assignment,  participation,  transfer or  designation or
(ii) the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for
a failure by such Non-U.S. Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (g)
above.

                  (i) Any Lender (or Transferee)  claiming any indemnity payment
or additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable
efforts  (consistent  with  legal  and  regulatory  restrictions)  to  file  any
certificate  or document  reasonably  requested  in writing by the Company or to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a
filing or change  would  avoid  the need for or  reduce  the  amount of any such
indemnity  payment or additional  amounts that may  thereafter  accrue and would
not,  in  the  determination  of  such  Lender  (or  Transferee),  be  otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

                  (j) Nothing  contained in this Section 2.19 shall  require any
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent to make available any of its
tax  returns  (or any  other  information  that it deems to be  confidential  or
proprietary).

                  SECTION  2.20.  Duty to Mitigate;  Assignment  of  Commitments
Under  Certain  Circumstances.  (a) Any  Lender  (or  Transferee)  claiming  any
additional  amounts  payable  pursuant  to  Section  2.13  or  Section  2.19  or
exercising  its  rights  under  Section  2.14  shall  use   reasonable   efforts
(consistent  with legal and regulatory  restrictions) to file any certificate or
document  requested  by  the  Company  or to  change  the  jurisdiction  of  its
applicable  lending  office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid
the need for or reduce  the  amount  of any such  additional  amounts  which may
thereafter  accrue or avoid the  circumstances  giving rise to such exercise and
would not, in the  determination  of such Lender (or  Transferee),  be otherwise


<PAGE>
                                                                              29


disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

                  (b) In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice
or  certificate  pursuant  to  Section  2.13 or 2.14,  or the  Company  shall be
required to make  additional  payments to any Lender  under  Section  2.19,  the
Company shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative  Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section  9.04) all  interests,  rights and  obligations  contained  hereunder to
another financial institution which shall assume such obligations; provided that
(i) no such assignment  shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order
of any Governmental  Authority and (ii) the assignee or the Company, as the case
may be, shall pay to the affected  Lender in immediately  available funds on the
date of such  assignment  the  principal of and interest  accrued to the date of
payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts  accrued for its
account or owed to it hereunder.

                  SECTION  2.21.  Terms of Local  Currency  Facilities.  (a) The
Company may in its discretion  from time to time elect to borrow,  or elect that
one or more  Borrowing  Subsidiaries  may  borrow,  Local  Currency  Loans  on a
revolving basis from any one or more Local Currency Lenders, with the consent of
each such Local Currency  Lender in its sole  discretion,  by delivering a Local
Currency Addendum to the Administrative  Agent and the applicable Local Currency
Lenders (through the Administrative  Agent),  executed by the Company, each such
Borrowing  Subsidiary and each such Local Currency  Lender;  provided,  however,
that on the effective  date of such election,  and after giving effect  thereto,
(i) an Exchange Rate with respect to each Local  Currency  covered by such Local
Currency  Addendum shall be  determinable  by reference to the Reuters  currency
pages (or comparable  publicly  available  screen);  (ii) no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (iii) the aggregate amount of
all Local Currency  Facility Maximum  Borrowing Amounts under all Local Currency
Addenda at the time in effect shall not exceed $350,000,000.  Each Borrower and,
by agreeing to any Local Currency Addendum, each relevant Local Currency Lender,
acknowledges  and agrees that each  reference  in this  Agreement  to any Lender
shall,  to the  extent  applicable,  be deemed to be a  reference  to such Local
Currency Lender, subject to the second sentence of the definition of such term.

                  (b) Each  Local  Currency  Addendum  shall  set  forth (i) the
maximum amount  (expressed in Dollars and without  duplication)  available to be
borrowed from all Local Currency Lenders under such Local Currency  Addendum (as
the same may be reduced from time to time pursuant to Section  2.22(c) or (d), a
"Local Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount") and (ii) with respect to
each Local Currency  Lender party to such Local Currency  Addendum,  the maximum
amount (expressed in Dollars and without  duplication)  available to be borrowed
from such Local Currency Lender thereunder (as the same may be reduced from time
to time pursuant to Section  2.22(c) or (d), a "Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum
Borrowing Amount"). In no event shall the aggregate of all Local Currency Lender
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts in respect of any Local Currency  Lender at any time
exceed such  Lender's  Commitment.  Except as provided in Section  2.21(c),  the
making of Local Currency Loans by a Local Currency Lender under a Local Currency
Addendum shall under no circumstances reduce the amount available to be borrowed
from such Lender under any other Local Currency Addendum to which such Lender is
a party.

                  (c) Except as  otherwise  required  by  applicable  law, in no
event shall the Local  Currency  Lenders have the right to accelerate  the Local
Currency Loans  outstanding under any Local Currency  Addendum,  or to terminate
their  commitments (if any) thereunder to make Local Currency Loans prior to the
stated  termination  date in respect  thereof,  except that such Local  Currency
Lenders shall,  in each case, have such rights upon an acceleration of the Loans
and a termination of the Commitments  pursuant to Article VI,  respectively.  No
Local  Currency  Loan may be made if (i) an Exchange  Rate with  respect to such
Local Currency cannot be determined; (ii) a Default or an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; or (iii) after giving
effect  thereto,  (A) the sum of the  aggregate  principal  amount of the Dollar
Loans  (other  than   Competitive   Loans)  and  Local  Currency  Loans  (Dollar
Equivalent)  of any Lender  (and the  Affiliates  of such  Lender that are Local
Currency  Lenders) then outstanding


<PAGE>
                                                                              30


would  exceed  such  Lender's  Commitment,  (B)  the  Dollar  Equivalent  of the
aggregate  principal amount of outstanding Local Currency Loans denominated in a
specified  Local Currency would exceed the  applicable  Local Currency  Facility
Maximum  Borrowing  Amount,  or (C)  the  sum of the  aggregate  Standby  Credit
Exposures and the aggregate  Competitive  Loan Exposures  would exceed the Total
Commitment.

                  (d) The applicable  Borrower and the applicable Local Currency
Lenders,  or, if so specified in the relevant Local Currency Addendum,  an agent
acting on their behalf,  shall  furnish to the  Administrative  Agent,  promptly
following the making,  payment or prepayment of each Local Currency Loan, and at
any other time at the request of the  Administrative  Agent, a statement setting
forth the  outstanding  Local  Currency  Loans made  under  such Local  Currency
Addendum.

                  (e)   The   applicable   Borrower   shall   furnish   to   the
Administrative  Agent copies of any amendment,  supplement or other modification
to the terms of any Local Currency  Addendum  promptly  after the  effectiveness
thereof.

                  (f) The Company may terminate any Local Currency Addendum,  if
there are not any Loans outstanding  thereunder,  in its sole discretion (or, if
there are Loans outstanding thereunder,  with the consent of each Local Currency
Lender party  thereto),  by written notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  which
notice shall be executed by the Company, each relevant Borrowing Subsidiary and,
if their consent is required,  each such Local Currency  Lender.  Once notice of
such termination is received by the  Administrative  Agent,  such Local Currency
Addendum  and the loans  and  other  obligations  outstanding  thereunder  shall
immediately cease to be subject to the terms of this Agreement.


                  SECTION 2.22. Currency  Fluctuations,  etc. (a) Not later than
1:00 p.m.,  New York City time, on each  Calculation  Date,  the  Administrative
Agent shall (i)  determine the Exchange  Rate as of such  Calculation  Date with
respect to each Local  Currency  covered by a Local  Currency  Addendum and (ii)
give notice  thereof to the  Lenders,  the Company  and the  relevant  Borrowing
Subsidiaries.  The Exchange  Rates so determined  shall become  effective on the
first Business Day immediately following the relevant Calculation Date (a "Reset
Date") and shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date.

                  (b) Not later  than 5:00  p.m.,  New York City  time,  on each
Reset Date and each Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall (i) determine
the Dollar Equivalent of the Local Currency Loans then outstanding (after giving
effect to any Local  Currency  Loans to be made or repaid on such date) and (ii)
notify the Lenders,  the Company and the relevant Borrowing  Subsidiaries of the
results of such determination.

                  (c) If, on any Reset Date or any Borrowing  Date (after giving
effect  to (i) any  Loans  to be made  or  repaid  on such  date  and  (ii)  any
amendment,  supplement  or other  modification  to any Local  Currency  Addendum
effective on such date of which the  Administrative  Agent has received notice),
the  aggregate  outstanding  Dollar  Standby  Extensions of Credit of any Lender
exceeds  the Dollar  Standby  Credit  Overage of such Lender (the amount of such
excess being called the "Dollar  Standby  Credit  Excess"),  then such  Lender's
Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount  under each  Local  Currency
Addendum  to which  such  Lender is a party  shall be reduced on such date by an
amount  equal to the  product  of such  Dollar  Standby  Credit  Excess  times a
fraction the numerator of which shall equal the Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum
Borrowing Amount under such Local Currency Addendum and the denominator of which
shall equal the aggregate of the Local Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing Amounts
of such Lender.  After  giving  effect to any such  reduction in Local  Currency
Lender Maximum Borrowing Amounts,  the Local Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing
Amount with respect to each Local Currency  Addendum shall in turn be reduced to
an amount equal to the aggregate of the Local Currency Lender Maximum  Borrowing
Amounts of all Lenders  party to such Local  Currency  Addendum.  Reductions  in
Local Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts and Local Currency  Lender
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts  pursuant to this Section 2.22(c) shall be effective

<PAGE>
                                                                              31


until the amount thereof shall be  recalculated by the  Administrative  Agent on
the next  succeeding  Reset Date or Borrowing  Date,  and shall not be deemed to
reduce the  stated  amount of any  commitment  of any Local  Currency  Lender in
respect of any Local Currency Addendum.

(d) If, on any Reset Date or  Borrowing  Date  (after  giving  effect to (i) any
Loans to be made or repaid on such date, (ii) any amendment, supplement or other
modification to any Local Currency Addendum  effective on such date of which the
Administrative  Agent has received  notice and (iii) any  reduction in the Local
Currency   Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts  pursuant  to  Section  2.22(c)
effective on such date), the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding Dollar Standby
Extensions of Credit of all the Lenders and (B) the aggregate  Competitive  Loan
Exposures  exceed the Dollar  Facility  Overage (the amount of such excess being
called the "Dollar Facility  Excess"),  then the Local Currency Facility Maximum
Borrowing  Amount under each Local  Currency  Addendum  shall be reduced on such
date by an amount  equal to the product of such Dollar  Facility  Excess times a
fraction the numerator of which shall equal the Local Currency  Facility Maximum
Borrowing Amount under such Local Currency Addendum and the denominator of which
shall equal the  aggregate  of the Local  Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing
Amounts with respect to all Local Currency  Addenda.  Each such reduction in the
Local Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount under a Local Currency Addendum
shall in turn reduce the  respective  Local Currency  Lender  Maximum  Borrowing
Amounts of each Local Currency Lender party to such Local Currency Addendum, pro
rata on the basis of the  respective  Local Currency  Lender  Maximum  Borrowing
Amounts of such Local  Currency  Lenders  immediately  prior to such  reduction.
Reductions  in Local  Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts  and Local
Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing Amounts pursuant to this Section 2.22(d) shall
be  effective   until  the  amount   thereof  shall  be   recalculated   by  the
Administrative  Agent on the next  succeeding  Reset Date or Borrowing Date, and
shall not be deemed to reduce the stated  amount of any  commitment of any Local
Currency Lender in respect of any Local Currency Addendum.

                  (e) If, on any Reset Date, the Dollar  Equivalent of the Local
Currency Loans  outstanding  under a Local Currency Addendum exceeds 105% of the
Local Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount with respect thereto (after
giving effect to any reductions  therein effected pursuant to Section 2.22(c) or
(d) on such date), then the relevant Borrower shall,  within three Business Days
after  notice  thereof  from the  Administrative  Agent,  (i) increase the Local
Currency  Facility Maximum  Borrowing Amount with respect to such Local Currency
Facility in accordance  with Section  2.21(e)  and/or (ii) prepay Local Currency
Loans,  in either case in an aggregate  amount such that,  after  giving  effect
thereto,  (x) the Dollar  Equivalent of all such Local  Currency  Loans shall be
equal to or less than such Local Currency  Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount and
(y) the Dollar  Equivalent of the Local  Currency  Loans of each relevant  Local
Currency  Lender  shall be equal to or less than such  Local  Currency  Lender's
Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount  with  respect to such Local
Currency Addendum.

                  (f) If, on any Reset Date, the Standby Credit  Exposure of any
Lender  exceeds 105% of such Lender's  Commitment,  then,  within three Business
Days after  notice  thereof from the  Administrative  Agent,  the Company  shall
prepay and/or cause the relevant  Borrowing  Subsidiaries to prepay the Loans in
accordance with this Agreement,  in an aggregate  amount such that, after giving
effect thereto,  the Standby Credit Exposure of such Lender shall be equal to or
less than such Lender's Standby Credit Commitment.

                  (g)  The  Administrative   Agent  shall  promptly  notify  the
relevant  Lenders of the amount of any  reductions  in Local  Currency  Facility
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts or Local Currency Lender Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts
required pursuant to this Section 2.22.

                  SECTION 2.23.  Increase in Total  Commitment.  (a) The Company
may from time to time,  by written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent  (which
shall deliver a copy thereof to each Lender),  request that the Total Commitment
be increased by an amount not to exceed the Incremental  Facility Amount at such
time.  Such notice shall set forth the amount of the  requested  increase in the
Total  Commitment  (which shall be an integral  multiple of $10,000,000) and the

<PAGE>
                                                                              32


date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall not be
less than 10 Business  Days or more than 60 days after the date of such notice),
and shall offer to each Lender the opportunity to increase its Commitment by its
Pro Rata  Percentage of the proposed  increased  amount.  Each Lender shall,  by
notice to the Company and the  Administrative  Agent given not more than 10 days
after  the date on which the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  delivered  the
Company's notice, either agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of
the offered  amount (each Lender so agreeing  being an  "Increasing  Lender") or
decline to increase  its  Commitment  (and any Lender that does not deliver such
notice  within  such  period  of 10 days  shall be deemed  to have  declined  to
increase  its  Commitment)  (each  Lender so  declining  or being deemed to have
declined being a  "Non-Increasing  Lender").  In the event that, on the 10th day
after the  Administrative  Agent shall have delivered the Company's notice,  the
Lenders shall have agreed  pursuant to the preceding  sentence to increase their
Commitments  by an  aggregate  amount  less  than  the  increase  in  the  Total
Commitment  requested  by the  Company,  the Company may arrange for one or more
banks  or  other  financial  institutions  (any  such  bank or  other  financial
institution referred to in this clause (a) being called an "Augmenting Lender"),
which may include any Lender,  to extend  Commitments or increase their existing
Commitments in an aggregate  amount equal to the unsubscribed  amount;  provided
that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject
to the approval of the Administrative  Agent and the Company and each Augmenting
Lender shall execute all such  documentation as the  Administrative  Agent shall
specify to evidence its Commitment and/or its status as a Lender hereunder.  Any
increase in the Total Commitment may be made in an amount which is less than the
increase  requested  by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange  for, or
chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders.

                  (b) On the effective date (the "Increase  Effective  Date") of
any  increase  in the  Total  Commitment  pursuant  to this  Section  2.23  (the
"Commitment Increase"),  (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Standby Loans
outstanding  (the  "Initial  Loans")  immediately  prior to giving effect to the
Commitment  Increase on the Increase  Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid;
(ii) each Increasing  Lender and each  Augmenting  Lender that shall have been a
Lender prior to the Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in
same day funds an amount equal to the difference  between (A) the product of (1)
such  Lender's  Pro Rata  Percentage  (calculated  after  giving  effect  to the
Commitment Increase)  multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent  Borrowings
(as  hereinafter  defined)  and (B) the  product of (1) such  Lender's  Pro Rata
Percentage  (calculated  without  giving  effect  to  the  Commitment  Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans;  (iii) each Augmenting Lender
that shall not have been a Lender prior to the Commitment  Increase shall pay to
the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (1)
such Augmenting Lender's Pro Rata Percentage  (calculated after giving effect to
the  Commitment  Increase)  multiplied  by (2)  the  amount  of  the  Subsequent
Borrowings;  (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in
clauses  (ii) and  (iii)  above,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  pay to each
Non-Increasing  Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference
between (A) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing  Lender's Pro Rata Percentage
(calculated without giving effect to the Commitment  Increase) multiplied by (2)
the amount of the Initial Loans, and (B) the product of (1) such  Non-Increasing
Lender's Pro Rata Percentage  (calculated  after giving effect to the Commitment
Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent  Borrowings;  (v) after
the  effectiveness  of the Commitment  Increase,  the Company shall be deemed to
have made new Borrowings (the "Subsequent Borrowings") in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate  principal  amount of the Initial Loans and of the
Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a borrowing request delivered in
accordance with Section 2.04; (vi) each  Non-Increasing  Lender, each Increasing
Lender  and  each  Augmenting  Lender  shall  be  deemed  to hold  its Pro  Rata
Percentage of each Subsequent  Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to
the Commitment Increase); and (vii) the Company shall pay each Increasing Lender
and each  Non-Increasing  Lender any and all accrued but unpaid  interest on the
Initial Loans.  The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect
of each  Eurocurrency  Loan shall be subject to  indemnification  by the Company
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the Increase Effective Date occurs
other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.

                  (c)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  no increase in the Total
Commitment  (or in the  Commitment  of any  Lender) or  addition of a new Lender
shall become  effective  under this  Section  2.23  unless,  (i) on the Increase
Effective  Date,  the  conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section
4.01 shall be  satisfied  and the  Administrative  Agent  shall have  received a
certificate  to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial  Officer
of the Company;  (ii) no reduction of the Total  Commitment  shall have occurred
prior to the Increase Effective Date; and (iii) the  Administrative  Agent shall
have  received  (with  sufficient  copies  for  each of the  Lenders)  documents
consistent  with those delivered on the Effective Date under clauses (a) and (b)
of Section 4.02 of the Existing  Credit  Agreement as to the corporate power and
authority  of the  Company  to  borrow  hereunder  after  giving  effect to such
increase.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Each Borrower  represents  and warrants to each of the Lenders
that:


                  SECTION 3.01. Organization;  Powers. Each Borrower and each of
the  Restricted  Subsidiaries  (a)  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing  and in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of its

result in a Material Adverse Effect;  and (d) in the case of each Borrower,  has
the  corporate  power  and  authority  to  execute,   deliver  and  perform  its
obligations under the Loan Documents and to borrow hereunder and thereunder.

                  SECTION  3.02.  Authorization.  The  execution,  delivery  and
performance by the Borrowers of this  Agreement and any promissory  notes issued
pursuant  to  Section  9.04(i)  and each  Local  Currency  Addendum  (and by the
Borrowing   Subsidiaries  of  each  Borrowing  Subsidiary   Agreement)  and  the
Borrowings  hereunder  (collectively,  the  "Transactions")  (a) have  been duly
authorized  by all requisite  corporate  action and (b) will not (i) violate (A)
any  provision of any law,  statute,  rule or regulation  (including  the Margin
Regulations)  or of the  certificate  of  incorporation  or  other  constitutive
documents  or  by-laws  of the  Borrowers;  (B) any  order  of any  Governmental

agreement or other instrument,  or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of
any lien upon any property or assets of any Borrower.

                  SECTION  3.03.  Enforceability.  This  Agreement and each Loan
Document to which a Borrower is a party  constitutes a legal,  valid and binding
obligation of each such Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms.

                  SECTION 3.04.  Governmental  Approvals.  No action, consent or

                  (b) As of  the  date  of  this  Second  Amended  and  Restated
Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, there has
been no material adverse change in the consolidated  financial  condition of the
Company  and the  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole  from the  financial  condition
reported in the financial statements referenced in paragraph (a) of this Section
3.05.

                  SECTION 3.06. Litigation; Compliance with Laws. (a) Subject to
Schedule 3.06, there are no actions,  proceedings or investigations filed or (to
the  knowledge  of  the  Borrowers)  threatened  against  any  Borrower  or  any
Subsidiary  in any court or before any  Governmental  Authority  or  arbitration
board or tribunal which question the validity or legality of this Agreement, the
Transactions  or any action taken or to be taken  pursuant to this Agreement and
no order or judgment has been issued or entered  restraining  or  enjoining  any
Borrower or any Subsidiary  from the execution,  delivery or performance of this
Agreement nor is there any other action,  proceeding or  investigation  filed or
(to the  knowledge of any  Borrower or any  Subsidiary)  threatened  against any
Borrower or any Subsidiary in any court or before any Governmental  Authority or
arbitration  board or tribunal  which would be reasonably  likely to result in a
Material  Adverse  Effect or materially  restrict the ability of any Borrower to
comply with its obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Neither any Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
any law, rule or regulation  (including any law, rule or regulation  relating to
the  protection  of the  environment  or to employee  health or  safety),  or in
default  with  respect  to any  judgment,  writ,  injunction  or  decree  of any
Governmental  Authority,  where such  violation or default  would be  reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) No exchange control law or regulation materially restricts
any  Borrower  from  complying  with its  obligations  in respect of any Loan or
otherwise under this Agreement or any Local Currency Addendum.

                  SECTION 3.07.  Federal  Reserve  Regulations.  (a) Neither any
Borrower nor any Subsidiary that will receive proceeds of the Loans hereunder is
engaged principally,  or as one of its important activities,  in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used,  whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,  incidentally or ultimately, to
purchase or carry Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally incurred for
such purpose, or for any other purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
inconsistent with, the provisions of the Margin Regulations.

                  SECTION 3.08.  Investment  Company Act; Public Utility Holding
Company  Act.  No  Borrower  is (a) an  "investment  company"  as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
or (b) a "holding  company" as defined in, or subject to regulation  under,  the
Public  Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935.  While  certain  subsidiaries  of
Hartford Life  Insurance  Company are  "investment  companies" as defined in the
1940 Act, the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement will not violate or
require any  approval  under such Act or any  regulations  promulgated  pursuant
thereto.

                  SECTION 3.09. Use of Proceeds. All proceeds of the Loans shall
be used for the purposes referred to in the recitals to this Agreement.

report,  financial  statement,  other written  information or other  information
transmitted  orally during a formal  presentation,  furnished by or on behalf of
any  Borrower  to the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  pursuant  to  this
Agreement or in connection with the arrangement,  syndication and closing of the
credit  facilities  established  hereby,  contains or will  contain any material
misstatement  of fact or omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements  therein,  in the light

of the circumstances under which they were or will be made, not misleading.

                  SECTION 3.11.  Taxes. Each Borrower and each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries  have filed or caused to be filed all Federal,  state and local tax
returns  which are  required to be filed by them,  and have paid or caused to be
paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns or on any assessments
received by any of them,  other than any taxes or  assessments  the  validity of
which is being  contested  in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings,  and with
respect to which appropriate  accounting reserves have to the extent required by
GAAP or SAP, as applicable, been set aside.

                  SECTION 3.12.  Employee  Pension  Benefit  Plans.  The present
aggregate  value  of  accumulated   benefit  obligations  of  all  unfunded  and
underfunded  pension plans of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (based on those
assumptions used for disclosure in corporate financial  statements in accordance
with GAAP or SAP, as  applicable)  did not, as of December 31,  2001,  exceed by
more than $397,000,000 the value of the assets of all such plans. In these cases
the Company has recorded book reserves to meet the obligations.

interest  thereon and any unpaid  accrued Fees and all other  liabilities of the
Borrowers accrued hereunder shall automatically become due and payable,  without
presentment,  demand,  protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby   expressly   waived   anything   contained   herein   to  the   contrary

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTEE

                  The Company unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due
and punctual payment and performance,  when and as due, whether at maturity,  by
acceleration,  upon one or more dates set for  prepayment or  otherwise,  of the
Guaranteed   Obligations.   The  Company  further  agrees  that  the  Guaranteed
Obligations may be extended or renewed,  in whole or in part,  without notice or
further  assent  from it and  that it  will  remain  bound  upon  its  guarantee
notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  The Company waives  presentment to, demand of payment from and
protest to the Borrowing Subsidiaries of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,  and
also waives  notice of  acceptance  of its  guarantee  and notice of protest for
nonpayment.  The  obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be affected by
(a) the  failure of any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce  any
right or remedy against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries under the provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise; (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of
any of the terms or  provisions  of this  Agreement,  any guarantee or any other
agreement;  (c) any law,  regulation or order of any jurisdiction,  or any other
event,  affecting any term of any Guaranteed  Obligation or any Lender's  rights
with respect thereto;  or (d) the failure of any Lender to exercise any right or
remedy against any other  guarantor of the Guaranteed  Obligations.  The Company
hereby  agrees  that any  payments  in  respect  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations
pursuant to this Article VII will be paid to the  Administrative  Agent  without
setoff or counterclaim in Dollars (in the case of Guaranteed Obligations arising
under  this  Agreement)  or,  at the  option  of  the  relevant  Local  Currency
Lender(s),  in  Dollars  or in the  relevant  Local  Currency  (in  the  case of
Guaranteed  Obligations arising under any Local Currency  Facility),  at (a) the
office of the Administrative  Agent specified in Section 2.18(a) (in the case of
Guaranteed  Obligations  arising  under  this  Agreement)  or (b) at the  office
specified for payments under the relevant Local Currency  Addendum or such other
office as shall have been specified by the relevant Local Currency  Lender(s) in
each case to the extent  permitted by applicable  law (in the case of Guaranteed
Obligations arising under any Local Currency Addendum).

                  The Company  further  agrees that its guarantee  constitutes a
guarantee  of payment  when due and not of  collection,  and waives any right to
require that any resort be had by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to any
security,  if any,  held for  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or to any
balance of any deposit account or credit on its books, in favor of the Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any other person.

                  The obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be subject
to  any  reduction,  limitation,  impairment  or  termination  for  any  reason,
including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and
shall not be subject  to any  defense or  setoff,  counterclaim,  recoupment  or
termination   whatsoever   by   reason   of  the   invalidity,   illegality   or
unenforceability  of the Guaranteed  Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing,  the obligations of the Company hereunder shall
not be  discharged  or  impaired  or  otherwise  affected  by the failure of the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy under this Agreement,  any guarantee or any other  agreement,  by any
waiver or  modification  of any provision  thereof,  by any default,  failure or
delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or
by any other act or  omission  which may or might in any manner or to any extent
vary the risk of the Company or otherwise  operate as a discharge of the Company
as a matter of law or equity.

                                                                              44


                  To the extent  permitted by applicable law, the Company waives
any defense  based on or arising out of any defense  available to the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries, including any defense based on or arising out of any disability of
the  Borrowing   Subsidiaries,   or  the   unenforceability  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause,  or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Borrowing Subsidiaries, other than final payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at
their election,  foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or
more  judicial or  non-judicial  sales,  or  exercise  any other right or remedy
available to them against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries,  or any security  without
affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Company  hereunder except
to the extent the Guaranteed  Obligations  have been fully and finally paid. The
Company  waives any defense  arising out of any such  election  even though such
election  operates  to impair or to  extinguish  any right of  reimbursement  or
subrogation  or other  right or  remedy of the  Company  against  the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any security.

                  The Company  further agrees that its guarantee  shall continue
to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof,  of principal of or interest on any  Guaranteed  Obligation is
rescinded  or must  otherwise be restored by any Lender upon the  bankruptcy  or
reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.

                  In  furtherance  of the foregoing and not in limitation of any
other right which the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have at law or in
equity against the Company by virtue  hereof,  upon the failure of any Borrowing
Subsidiary to pay any  Guaranteed  Obligation  when and as the same shall become
due,  whether at  maturity,  by  acceleration,  after  notice of  prepayment  or
otherwise,  the Company  hereby  promises to and will,  upon  receipt of written
demand by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  forthwith pay or cause to be
paid to the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  in cash the  amount  of such
unpaid Guaranteed Obligation.

                  Until the  termination of this  Agreement and the  commitments
hereunder,  and the  repayment in full of all amounts due under this  Agreement,
the  Company  hereby  irrevocably  waives  and  releases  any and all  rights of
subrogation, indemnification, reimbursement and similar rights which it may have
against or in respect of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries at any time relating to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  including  all rights  that would  result in its being
deemed a "creditor" of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries  under the United States Code
as now in  effect or  hereafter  amended,  or any  comparable  provision  of any
successor statute.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  In order to expedite  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  JPMorgan  Chase Bank is hereby  appointed  to act as  Administrative
Agent  on  behalf  of the  Lenders.  Each  of  the  Lenders  hereby  irrevocably
authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to take  such  actions  on behalf of such
Lender  and to  exercise  such  powers  as  are  specifically  delegated  to the
Administrative  Agent by the terms and  provisions  hereof,  together  with such
actions and powers as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The  Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied  authority,  (a) to receive on behalf of the  Lenders  all  payments  of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other  amounts due to the Lenders
hereunder,  and promptly to  distribute  to each Lender its proper share of each
payment so received;  (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the
Borrowers of any Event of Default of which the  Administrative  Agent has actual
knowledge  acquired  in  connection  with  its  agency  hereunder;  and  (c)  to
distribute to each Lender copies of all notices,  financial statements and other
materials  delivered by the Borrowers  pursuant to this Agreement as received by
the Administrative Agent.

                  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any of its  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents  shall be liable as such for any action taken or
omitted  by any of them  except  for its or his or

                                                                              45


her own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment
of a court of  competent  jurisdiction,  or be  responsible  for any  statement,
warranty or representation  herein or the contents of any document  delivered in
connection  herewith,  or be  required  to  ascertain  or to  make  any  inquiry
concerning  the  performance or observance by the Borrowers of any of the terms,
conditions,   covenants  or  agreements   contained  in  this   Agreement.   The
Administrative  Agent  shall  not be  responsible  to the  Lenders  for  the due
execution,  genuineness,  validity,  enforceability  or  effectiveness  of  this
Agreement or other instruments or agreements.  The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the  Lender  which  makes any Loan as the  holder of the  indebtedness
resulting  therefrom for all purposes hereof until it shall have received notice
from such  Lender,  given as  provided  herein,  of the  transfer  thereof.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall in all  cases  be fully  protected  in  acting,  or
refraining from acting,  in accordance with written  instructions  signed by the
Required Lenders and, except as otherwise  specifically  provided  herein,  such
instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the
contrary,  be entitled to rely on any  instrument or document  believed by it in
good  faith to be genuine  and  correct  and to have been  signed or sent by the
proper  person  or  persons.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any of its
directors,  officers,  employees or agents shall have any  responsibility to the
Borrowers on account of the failure of or delay in  performance or breach by any
Lender of any of its  obligations  hereunder  or to any Lender on account of the
failure  of or delay  in  performance  or  breach  by any  other  Lender  or the
Borrowers of any of their  respective  obligations  hereunder  or in  connection
herewith.  The Administrative  Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by
or through  agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
legal counsel  selected by it with respect to all matters arising  hereunder and
shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or  suffered  in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

                  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the  Administrative  Agent
shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by
it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement  unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

                  Subject  to the  appointment  and  acceptance  of a  successor
Administrative  Agent as provided below, the Administrative  Agent may resign at
any time by notifying  the Lenders and the Company.  Upon any such  resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative
Agent acceptable to the Company. If no successor shall have been so appointed by
the Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted such  appointment  within 30 days
after the retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of its resignation,  then
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent may,  on behalf of the  Lenders,  appoint a
successor  Administrative  Agent  which  shall be a bank  with an  office in the
United States, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or
an  Affiliate  of any such  bank.  Upon the  acceptance  of any  appointment  as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed
to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the
retiring  Administrative  Agent and the retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations  hereunder.  After the Administrative
Agent's resignation  hereunder,  the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05
shall  continue  in effect for its  benefit in respect of any  actions  taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  With  respect  to  the  Loans  made  by  it   hereunder,   the
Administrative  Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers as any other  Lender and may  exercise the
same as though it were not the  Administrative  Agent,  and may accept  deposits
from,  lend  money to and  generally  engage  in any kind of  business  with the
Borrowers or any  Subsidiary  or other  Affiliate  thereof as if it were not the
Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative  Agent,
on  demand,  in the  amount  of its pro  rata  share  (based  on its  Commitment
hereunder or, if the Commitments  shall have been terminated,  the amount of its
outstanding  Loans) of any  expenses  incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by
such Agent, including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid
for  services  rendered  on behalf  of the  Lenders,  which  shall not have been
reimbursed  by the

                                                                              46


Borrowers and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the  Administrative  Agent and
any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of
such  pro  rata  share,  from  and  against  any  and  all  liabilities,  taxes,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature  whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as  Administrative  Agent
in any way  relating to or arising out of this  Agreement or any action taken or
omitted  by it under this  Agreement  to the extent the same shall not have been
reimbursed  by the  Borrowers;  provided  that no Lender  shall be liable to the
Administrative Agent for any portion of such liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the gross negligence or wilful  misconduct of the  Administrative
Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

                  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  it  has,  independently  and
without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis  and  decision  to  enter  into  this   Agreement.   Each  Lender  also
acknowledges  that  it  will,   independently  and  without  reliance  upon  the
Administrative  Agent  or any  other  Lender  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this  Agreement
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  Each party to this  Agreement  acknowledges  and  agrees  that
neither Bank of America,  N.A., in its capacity as Co-Administrative  Agent, nor
any  co-syndication   agent  will  have  duties  or  responsibilities   for  the
administration of this Agreement or the Borrowings hereunder.

                  SECTION   9.02.   Survival  of   Agreement.   All   covenants,
agreements,  representations  and warranties made by the Borrowers herein and in
the certificates or other  instruments  prepared or delivered in connection with
or pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be  considered to have been relied upon by
the Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans  regardless
of any investigation  made by the Lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue
in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued  interest on
any  Loan or any  Fee or any  other  amount  payable  under  this  Agreement  is
outstanding and unpaid, or the Commitments have not been terminated.

                  SECTION 9.03.  Binding  Effect.  This  Agreement  shall become
effective on the Second  Amended and Restated  Effective Date when it shall have
been  executed  by the  Company  and  the  Administrative  Agent  and  when  the
Administrative Agent shall have received copies hereof (telecopied or otherwise)
which,  when taken  together,  bear the signature of each Required  Lender,  and
thereafter  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrowers shall not
have the right to assign any rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior consent of all the Lenders.

                  SECTION  9.04.  Successors  and Assigns.  (a) Whenever in this
Agreement  any of the parties  hereto is referred  to, such  reference  shall be
deemed to include the successors  and assigns of such party;  and all covenants,
promises and  agreements by or on behalf of any party that are contained in this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns.

                  (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more  assignees  all or a
portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a  portion  of its  Commitment  and the  Loans at the time  owing to it);
provided, however, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a
Lender Affiliate, the Company and the Administrative Agent must give their prior
written  consent  (except when there exists a Default or an Event of Default) to
such  assignment  (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld);  (ii) the
parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the  Administrative
Agent an Assignment  and  Acceptance,  and a processing and  recordation  fee of
$3,500;  (iii) the assignee,  if it shall not be a Lender,  shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and (iv) the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning  Lender subject to each such assignment  (determined
as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance  with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 and the
amount of the Commitment of such Lender  remaining after such  assignment  shall
not be less than  $5,000,000  or shall be zero.  Upon  acceptance  and recording
pursuant to paragraph  (e) of this Section,  from and after the  effective  date
specified in each  Assignment and  Acceptance,  which effective date shall be at
least  five  Business  Days  after  the  execution  thereof,  (A)  the  assignee
thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest  assigned
by such Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this  Agreement  and (B) the assigning  Lender  thereunder  shall,  to the
extent of the interest  assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,  be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender  shall cease to be a party
hereto (but shall  continue to be  entitled  to the  benefits of Sections  2.13,
2.15,  2.19 and 9.05,  as well as to any Fees accrued for its account  hereunder
and not yet paid)).  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any Lender  assigning its
rights and  obligations  under this Agreement may retain any  Competitive  Loans
made by it  outstanding  at such time,  and in such case shall retain its rights
hereunder in respect of any Loans so retained  until such Loans have been repaid
in full in accordance with this Agreement.

                  (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,
the assigning Lender  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:
(i) such assigning  Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest  being assigned  thereby free and clear of any adverse claim;  (ii)
except as set forth in (i) above,  such assigning Lender makes no representation
or  warranty  and  assumes no  responsibility  with  respect to any  statements,
warranties or representations  made in or

                                                                              48


in  connection  with  this  Agreement,  or the  execution,  legality,  validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished  pursuant hereto or the financial  condition of
the  Borrowers  or  the  performance  or  observance  by  the  Borrowers  of any
obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant hereto;  (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally
authorized  to enter into such  Assignment  and  Acceptance;  (iv) such assignee
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,  together with copies of
the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.03 and such
other  documents and  information  as it has deemed  appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such  Assignment and Acceptance;  (v)
such assignee will  independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise  such  powers  under this  Agreement  as are
delegated to the  Administrative  Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that
it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations  which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (d) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  at one of its
offices  in The  City  of New  York a copy  of each  Assignment  and  Acceptance
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders,  and the Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error
and the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  may treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a
Lender  hereunder  for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The  Register  shall be
available for inspection by each party hereto,  at any reasonable  time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)  Upon  its  receipt  of a duly  completed  Assignment  and
Acceptance  executed by an  assigning  Lender and an assignee  together  with an
Administrative  Questionnaire  completed in respect of the assignee  (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender  hereunder),  the processing and  recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) above and the written consent of the Company to
such assignment,  the Administrative  Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.

                  (f) Each Lender may sell  participations  to one or more banks
or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement  (including  all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to
it); provided,  however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged;  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other  parties  hereto  for the  performance  of such  obligations;  (iii)  each
participating  bank or other entity shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost
protection  provisions  contained  in Sections  2.13,  2.15 and 2.19 to the same
extent as if it were the selling  Lender  (and  limited to the amount that could
have been claimed by the selling Lender had it continued to hold the interest of
such participating  bank or other entity),  except that all claims made pursuant
to such  Sections  shall  be made  through  such  selling  Lender;  and (iv) the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such selling  Lender in  connection  with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement.

                  (g) Any Lender or  participant  may,  in  connection  with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to
this Section,  disclose to the assignee or participant  or proposed  assignee or
participant any information  relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender;
provided that, prior to any such  disclosure,  each such assignee or participant
or proposed  assignee or  participant  shall  execute an agreement  whereby such
assignee  or  participant  shall  agree  (subject to  customary  exceptions)  to
preserve the confidentiality of any such information.

                  (h) The Borrowers  shall not assign or delegate any rights and
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders.

                  (i) Any  Lender may at any time  pledge all or any  portion of
its rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
pledge shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such Bank for such  Lender as a party  hereto.  In order to  facilitate  such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, each Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender,  duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes evidencing the Loans made to such Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.05. Expenses;  Indemnity. (a) The Borrowers agree to
pay all reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by each Agent in connection
with  the  syndication  of  the  credit  facility   provided  for  herein,   the
preparation,  execution,  delivery and  administration  of this  Agreement or in
connection  with any  amendments,  modifications  or waivers  of the  provisions
hereof,  or  incurred  by  either  Agent or any  Lender in  connection  with the
enforcement  or protection of their rights in connection  with this Agreement or
in  connection  with the  Loans  made  hereunder  or under  any  Local  Currency
Addendum,  including the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of counsel for each
Agent or, in the case of enforcement costs and documentary taxes, the Lenders.

                  (b) The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender, each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and
agents of the foregoing (each such person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages,
liabilities  and  related  expenses,   including  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses,  incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the use of
the  proceeds of the Loans;  or (iii) any claim,  litigation,  investigation  or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,  whether or not any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available  to the extent  that such  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or
related  expenses  are  determined  by a final  judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section shall remain  operative and
in full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the  expiration  of the term of this
Agreement,  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any investigation  made by or on behalf of either
Agent or any  Lender.  All amounts  due under this  Section  shall be payable on
written demand therefor.

                  SECTION  9.06.   APPLICABLE   LAW.  THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL  BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  SECTION 9.07. Waivers;  Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay of
the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  in  exercising  any  power  or right
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power,  or any  abandonment or  discontinuance  of
steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other or further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of
the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would  otherwise  have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure  therefrom  shall
in any event be effective  unless the same shall be  permitted by paragraph  (b)
below,  and then such waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific
instance  and for the  purpose  for  which  given.  No  notice  or demand on any
Borrower or any  Subsidiary in any case shall entitle such party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  (b) Neither this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof may be
waived,  amended or

<PAGE>
                                                                              50

modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the  Borrowers  and the Required  Lenders;  provided,  however,  that no such
agreement shall (i) decrease the principal  amount of, or extend the maturity of
or any scheduled  principal payment date or date for the payment of any interest
on any Loan or any Fee or other amount due hereunder or waive or excuse any such
payment or any part  thereof,  or  decrease  the rate of  interest  on any Loan,
without the prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (ii) increase
the Commitment,  decrease the Facility Fee or other amount owing to, or decrease
the Usage Fee of any Lender  without the prior  written  consent of such Lender;
(iii) limit or release the  guarantee set forth in Article VII; or (iv) amend or
modify the provisions of Section 2.16 or Section 9.04(h), the provisions of this
Section or the definition of the "Required  Lenders",  without the prior written
consent of each Lender; provided further,  however, that no such agreement shall
amend,  modify or  otherwise  affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative
Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the  Administrative  Agent.
Each Lender shall be bound by any waiver,  amendment or modification  authorized
by this  Section and any consent by any Lender  pursuant to this  Section  shall
bind any assignee of its rights and interests hereunder.

                  SECTION  9.08.  Entire  Agreement.   This  Agreement  and  the
agreements  referred to in Section 2.06 constitute the entire contract among the
parties relative to the subject matter hereof.  Any previous agreement among the
parties  with  respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof  is  superseded  by this
Agreement.  Nothing in this  Agreement,  expressed  or  implied,  is intended to
confer  upon any party  other  than the  parties  hereto any  rights,  remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.09.  Severability.  In the event any one or more of
the provisions  contained in this Agreement  should be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality and enforceability of the
remaining  provisions  contained  herein  shall  not in any way be  affected  or
impaired  thereby.  The parties  shall  endeavor in good-faith  negotiations  to
replace the invalid,  illegal or unenforceable  provisions with valid provisions
the economic  effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

                  SECTION 9.10. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken  together shall  constitute but one contract,  and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03.

                  SECTION 9.11.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for  convenience  of reference  only,  are not
part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.12.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be  continuing,  each Lender is hereby  authorized at any time
and from time to time,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or
final) at any time held and other  indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or obligations of the Company and any Borrowing  Subsidiary
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender  shall have made any demand  under this  Agreement
and although such  obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify  the  Company  and  the  Administrative   Agent  after  such  setoff  and
application  made by such Lender,  but the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the  validity of such setoff and  application.  The rights of each Lender
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property,  to the  nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any New  York  State  court or
Federal  court of the United States of America  sitting in New York County,  and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, any Local Currency Addendum, or for

recognition  or  enforcement  of any  judgment,  and each of the parties  hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent  permitted  by law,  in such  Federal  court.  Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or  proceeding  shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner  provided by law.  Subject to the foregoing and to paragraph
(b)  below,  nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  affect any right that any party
hereto may  otherwise  have to bring any action or  proceeding  relating to this
Agreement,  any Local  Currency  Addendum  against any other party hereto in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b)  Each  Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  which it may now or  thereafter  have to the  laying  of venue of any
suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
Local  Currency  Addendum  in any New York State or Federal  court.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

                  (c)  Each  party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to
service of process in the manner  provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing
in this  Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.14.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  ARISING
OUT OF,  UNDER OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH THIS  AGREEMENT.  Each  party  hereto (a)
certifies  that no  representative,  agent or  attorney  of any other  party has
represented,  expressly  or  otherwise,  that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation,  seek to enforce the foregoing  waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and other parties  hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this Section.

                  SECTION  9.15.  Addition  of  Borrowing   Subsidiaries.   Each
Borrowing Subsidiary which shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing
Subsidiary  Agreement  executed by such  Subsidiary and the Company shall,  upon
such  delivery  and without  further  act,  become a party hereto and a Borrower
hereunder  with the same  effect  as if it had  been an  original  party to this
Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.16.  Conversion  of  Currencies.  (a)  If,  for the
purpose of  obtaining  judgment in any court,  it is  necessary to convert a sum
owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees,
to the fullest  extent that it may  effectively do so, that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking  procedures in the
relevant  jurisdiction  the first  currency  could be purchased  with such other
currency  on the  Business  Day  immediately  preceding  the day on which  final
judgment is given.

                  (b) The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due
to any  party  hereto or any  holder of the  obligations  owing  hereunder  (the
"Applicable  Creditor") shall,  notwithstanding  any judgment in a currency (the
"Judgment  Currency")  other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be
due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that,
on the  Business Day  following  receipt by the  Applicable  Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,  the Applicable  Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant  jurisdiction purchase
the  Agreement  Currency  with  the  Judgment  Currency;  if the  amount  of the
Agreement  Currency  so  purchased  is less than the sum  originally  due to the
Applicable  Creditor  in the  Agreement  Currency,  the  Borrowers  agree,  as a
separate  obligation and  notwithstanding  any such  judgment,  to indemnify the
Applicable  Creditor  against  such  loss.  The  obligations  of  the  Borrowers
contained in this Section 9.16 shall survive the  termination  of this Agreement
and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

                  SECTION  9.17.  Confidentiality.  Each of the  Agents  and the
Lenders,  on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and agents,  agrees to maintain
the  confidentiality  of  the  Information  (as  defined  below),   except  that
Information  may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates  involved in the preparation
and execution of this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  thereby, and
to such Lender's and such Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including  accountants,  legal counsel and other  advisors (it being  understood
that the  persons  to whom  such  disclosure  is made  will be  informed  of the
confidential  nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential);  (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory or self-regulatory
authority;  (c) to the extent  required by applicable  laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process (it being  understood the applicable Agent
or Lender  shall  notify the  Company,  to the extent  permitted by law, of such
required  disclosure  within a reasonably  practicable  time after such Agent or
Lender gains  knowledge of the required  disclosure);  (d) to any other party to
this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or
any suit, action or proceeding  relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of
rights   hereunder;   (f)  subject  to  an   agreement   containing   provisions
substantially  the  same  as  those  of  this  Section,  to any  assignee  of or
participant  in, or any  prospective  assignee of or participant  in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement; (g) with the consent of the Company;
or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly  available other than
as a result of a breach of this  Section  or (ii)  becomes  available  to either
Agent or any  Lender on a  nonconfidential  basis  from a source  other than any
Borrower (it being  understood if disclosure  of such  Information  violates any
third-party  confidentiality  agreement  with any Borrower or any Subsidiary and
the  representative of the Agent or Lender involved has actual knowledge of such
third-party  confidentiality  agreement and was involved in the  preparation and
execution  of this  Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated  thereby,  such
disclosure  shall  not  be  permitted).   For  the  purposes  of  this  Section,
"Information"  means  all  confidential  information  received  from a  Borrower
relating to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
business other than any such information that is "structure" or "tax aspects" of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, as such terms are used in Code
sections  6011,  6111 or  6112,  and  the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder;
provided  that, in the case of  information  received from a Borrower  after the
date hereof,  such information is clearly  identified at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as  provided in this  Section  shall be  considered  to have  complied  with its
obligation  to do so if such  person has  exercised  the same  degree of care to
maintain the  confidentiality of such Information as such person would accord to
its own confidential information. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrowers, the
Agent and the Lenders agree that the  Borrowers,  the Agent and the Lenders (and
each  of  their  Affiliates,  their  directors,   officers,  agents,  attorneys,
employees and representatives) are permitted to disclose to any and all Persons,
without  limitation  of any  kind,  the  "structure"  and "tax  aspects"  of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  as such  terms are used in Code
sections 6011, 6111 or 6112, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and all
materials  of any kind  (including  opinions  or other  tax  analyses)  that are
provided to the Agent and the Lenders related to such structure and tax aspects.
The preceding  sentence and clause in the definition of "Information"  above are
set forth herein  solely to come within  certain "safe  harbor"  provisions  set
forth in certain  temporary  regulations  promulgated  under Code sections 6011,
6111 and 6112.

                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  parties  hereto  have  caused  this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective  authorized officers as of the
day and year first above written.

To The Lenders Listed on
Schedule A Attached Hereto
(the "Lenders")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to Section  4.02(a) of the Second
Amended and Restated Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the "Agreement") among The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a
Delaware  corporation  (the  "Company"),   the  Borrowing  Subsidiaries  parties
thereto,  the  Lenders  parties  thereto,  and  JPMorgan  Chase Bank and Bank of
America,  N.A., as Co-Administrative  Agents for the Lenders.  Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise  defined herein shall have the meanings  ascribed to them
in the Agreement.

In connection with this opinion,  as Senior Vice President of the Company,  I or
lawyers in the  Company's  legal staff working  under my  supervision,  have (i)
investigated  such questions of law, (ii) examined such corporate  documents and
records of the Company,  certificates of public  officials and other  documents,
and (iii) received such  information  from officers and  representatives  of the
Company as I have deemed necessary for the purpose of this opinion.  I have made
no independent  investigation as to the information contained in such documents,
records and certificates,  but I have no reason to believe that such information
is other than as reflected  therein.  In rendering this opinion,  I have assumed
(i) the  authenticity  of all documents  submitted to me as originals,  (ii) the
conformity to original documents of all documents  submitted to me as copies and
(iii) the genuineness of all signatures.



<PAGE>
                                                                               2


Based upon the foregoing and subject to the  qualifications  set forth herein, I
am of the opinion that:

1.       The Company (i) is a corporation  duly  incorporated,  validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,  (ii) has
         all  requisite  corporate  power and  authority to own its property and
         assets  and  to  carry  on its  business  as now  conducted,  (iii)  is
         qualified to do business in every jurisdiction within the United States
         where such  qualification  is required,  except where the failure to so
         qualify would not result in a Material  Adverse  Effect on the Company,
         and (iv) has all  requisite  corporate  power and authority to execute,
         deliver and perform its  obligations  under the Agreement and to borrow
         funds thereunder.

2.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement
         and  the  borrowings  of  the  Company  thereunder  (collectively,  the
         "Transactions")   (i)  have  been  duly  authorized  by  all  requisite
         corporate  action and (ii) will not (a) (1)  violate any  provision  of
         law, statute,  rule or regulation  (including without  limitation,  the
         Margin  Regulations),  or of the certificate of  incorporation or other
         constitutive documents or by-laws of the Company, (2) violate any order
         of any  governmental  authority,  or (3) to my  knowledge,  violate any
         provision of any indenture,  agreement or other instrument to which the
         Company is a party or by which the Company or its property is or may be
         bound, (b) to my knowledge,  be in conflict with, result in a breach of
         or constitute (along or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default
         under any such  indenture,  agreement or other  instrument or (c) to my
         knowledge,  except  as  allowed  under  the  Agreement,  result  in the
         creation or  imposition  of any lien upon any property or assets of the
         Company.

3.       The  Agreement  has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
         constitutes a valid and binding  obligation of the Company  enforceable
         against  the  Company  in  accordance   with  its  terms,   subject  to
         bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency,  moratorium  or other similar
         laws of general application  relating to or affecting creditors' rights
         generally and general principles of equity (whenever applied by a court
         of law or equity).

4.       No action,  consent or approval of,  registration  or filing with,  any
         other  action by, any  government  authority  is or will be required in
         connection  with the  Transactions,  except  such as have  been made or
         obtained and are in full force and effect.

5.       Neither the Company  nor any of its  subsidiaries  is (a) except as set
         forth in the next sentence,  an "investment  company" as defined in, or
         subject to regulation  under,  the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the
         "1940  Act") or (b) a "holding  company"  as defined  in, or subject to
         regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. While
         certain  subsidiaries  of the Company  are  "investment  companies"  as
         defined  in  the  1940  Act,  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
         Agreement  will not violate or require any  approval  under such Act or
         any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.

The opinions  expressed above are limited to questions arising under the laws of
the State of Connecticut,  the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
and the Federal laws of the United States of America.

With your  approval,  with  respect to my opinion in  paragraph 3 above,  I have
assumed  that the laws of the  State of New York are  identical  to those of the
State of Connecticut.

Also with your  approval,  I have  relied as to certain  matters on  information
obtained  from public  officials,  officers  of the  Company  and other  sources
believed by me to be responsible  and I have assumed that the Agreement has been
duly  authorized,  executed and delivered by each of the Lenders and by JPMorgan
Chase Bank and Bank of America,  N.A. in their  capacities as  Co-Administrative
Agents of the Lenders.

This  opinion is rendered in my  capacity as an officer of the  Company,  and is
solely for your  benefit and may not be quoted or relied upon by, nor may copies
be delivered to, any other person,  nor used for any other  purpose,  without my
prior written consent in each instance.

Very truly yours,



Brian S. Becker

                                    BORROWING SUBSIDIARY AGREEMENT dated as of [

                           and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as
                           co-administrative   agents  (in  such  capacity,  the
                           "Co-Administrative  Agents", it being agreed that all
                           references herein to the "Administrative Agent" shall
                           be references to JPMorgan Chase Bank) for the lenders
                           (the  "Lenders")  party  to the  Second  Amended  and
                           Restated Five-Year  Competitive Advance and Revolving
                           Credit  Facility  Agreement  dated as of February 26,
                           2003,  as  amended  (the   "Agreement"),   among  the
                           Borrower,  each Borrowing  Subsidiary  party thereto,
                           the Co-Administrative Agents and the Lenders.

                  Under the Agreement,  the Lenders have agreed,  upon the terms
and subject to the conditions therein set forth, to make competitive advance and
revolving  credit loans to the Borrower and to  Subsidiaries  (as defined in the
Agreement) of the Borrower which execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
Borrowing  Subsidiary  Agreements  in the  form  of  this  Borrowing  Subsidiary
Agreement.  The Borrower  represents  that the Subsidiary is a subsidiary (as so
defined) of the  Borrower and that the  guarantee  of the Borrower  contained in
Article VII of the Agreement  applies to the obligations of the  Subsidiary.  In
consideration  of being  permitted to borrow under the Agreement  upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Subsidiary agrees that from
and after the date of this  Borrowing  Subsidiary  Agreement  it is, and will be
liable for the observance and performance of all the obligations of, a Borrowing
Subsidiary under the Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, to
the same extent as if it had been one of the original parties to the Agreement.

                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiary  have
caused  this  Borrowing  Subsidiary  Agreement  to be  duly  executed  by  their
authorized officers as of the date first appearing above.
