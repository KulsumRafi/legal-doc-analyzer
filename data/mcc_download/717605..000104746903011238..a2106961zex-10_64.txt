                    account to enter into an agreement substantially in the form
                    of Annex D hereto, pursuant to which the Joint Collateral
                    Agent shall have both sole dominion and control over such
                    Deposit Account (within the meaning of the common law) and
                    "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC)
                    over such Deposit Account. Each Grantor shall have entered
                    into such control agreement or agreements with respect to:
                    (i) any Securities Accounts or Securities Entitlements that
                    exist on the Closing Date, (ii) the Asset Sale Proceeds
                    Account within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date and
                    (iii) any Securities Accounts or Securities Entitlements
                    that are

                                       23
<Page>

                    created or acquired after the Closing Date, as of or prior
                    to the deposit or transfer of any such Securities
                    Entitlements or funds, whether constituting moneys or
                    investments, into such Securities Accounts.

                    (4)    INVESTMENT RELATED PROPERTY GENERALLY.

                    (i)    COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. Each Grantor hereby
            covenants and agrees that:

                           (1)  in the event it acquires rights in any
                    Investment Related Property after the date hereof, it shall
                    deliver to the Joint Collateral Agent quarterly a completed
                    Pledge Supplement, substantially in the form of Annex A
                    attached hereto, together with all Supplements to Schedules
                    thereto, reflecting such new Investment Related Property and
                    all other Investment Related Property. Notwithstanding the
                    foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the security
                    interest of the Joint Collateral Agent shall attach to all
                    Investment Related Property immediately upon any Grantor's
                    acquisition of rights therein and shall not be affected by
                    the failure of any Grantor to deliver a supplement to
                    Schedule III as required hereby; notwithstanding the
                    foregoing, in the event it acquires any Investment Related
                    Property with a fair market value greater than $25,000, it
                    shall deliver to the Joint Collateral Agent a Pledge
                    Supplement within thirty (30) days of acquiring such
                    Investment Related Property;

                           (2)  except as provided in the next sentence, in the
                    event such Grantor receives any dividends, interest or
                    distributions on any Investment Related Property, or any
                    securities or other property upon the merger, consolidation,
                    liquidation or dissolution of any issuer of any Investment
                    Related Property, then (a) such dividends, interest or
                    distributions and securities or other property shall be
                    included in the definition of Collateral without further
                    action and (b) such Grantor shall immediately take all
                    steps, if any, necessary or advisable to ensure the
                    validity, perfection, priority and, if applicable, control
                    of the Joint Collateral Agent over such Investment Related
                    Property (including, without limitation, delivery thereof to
                    the Joint Collateral Agent) and pending any such action such
                    Grantor shall be deemed to hold such dividends, interest,
                    distributions, securities or other property in trust for the
                    benefit of the Joint Collateral Agent and shall be
                    segregated from all other property of such Grantor.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of
                    Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Joint
                    Collateral Agent authorizes each Grantor to retain all
                    ordinary cash dividends and distributions paid in the normal
                    course of the business of the issuer and consistent with the
                    past practice of the issuer and all scheduled payments of
                    interest;

                           (3)  If any issuer of any Investment Related Property
                    is located in a jurisdiction outside of the United States,
                    each Grantor shall take such additional actions under the
                    laws of such issuer's jurisdiction to insure the validity,
                    perfection and priority (subject to Permitted Liens) of the
                    security interest of the Joint Collateral Agent. Upon the
                    occurrence of an Event of Default, the Joint Collateral
                    Agent shall have the right, without notice to any Grantor,
                    to transfer all or any portion of the Investment Related
                    Property to its name or the name of its nominee or agent. In
                    addition, the Joint Collateral Agent shall have the right at
                    any time, without notice to any Grantor, to exchange any
                    certificates or

                                       24
<Page>

                    instruments representing any Investment Related Property for
                    certificates or instruments of smaller or larger
                    denominations.

                    (ii)   DELIVERY AND CONTROL.

                           (1)  Each Grantor agrees that with respect to any
                    Investment Related Property in which it currently has rights
                    it shall comply with the provisions of this Section 4(c)(4)
                    on or before the Closing Date and with respect to any
                    Investment Related Property hereafter acquired by such
                    Grantor it shall comply with the provisions of this Section
                    4(c)(4) immediately upon acquiring rights therein, in each
                    case in form and substance satisfactory to the Joint
                    Collateral Agent. With respect to any Investment Related
                    Property that is represented by a certificate or that is an
                    "instrument" (other than (x) any Investment Related Property
                    credited to a Securities Account and instruments having a
                    principal amount of less than $7,500 individually and
                    $50,000 in the aggregate or (y) any instruments included in
                    the definition of Foreign Subsidiary Collateral that are
                    delivered to the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee)
                    it shall cause such certificate or instrument to be
                    delivered to the Joint Collateral Agent, indorsed in blank
                    by an "effective indorsement" (as defined in Section 8-107
                    of the UCC), regardless of whether such certificate
                    constitutes a "certificated security" for purposes of the
                    UCC. With respect to any Investment Related Property that is
                    an "uncertificated security" for purposes of the UCC (other
                    than any "uncertificated securities" credited to a
                    Securities Account), it shall cause the issuer of such
                    uncertificated security to either (i) register the Joint
                    Collateral Agent as the registered owner thereof on the
                    books and records of the issuer or (ii) execute an agreement
                    substantially in the form of Annex B hereto, pursuant to
                    which such issuer agrees to comply with the Joint Collateral
                    Agent's instructions with respect to such uncertificated
                    security without further consent by such Grantor.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the shares of
                    any Foreign Subsidiary subject to the security interest in
                    favor of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, it
                    shall be sufficient if the related Grantor shall take all
                    steps necessary under French and English law to create a
                    valid, perfected, first priority security interest (subject
                    to Permitted Liens) in favor of the Intercreditor Agent and
                    Security Trustee.

                    (iii)  VOTING AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

            So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

                           (1)  except as otherwise provided under the covenants
                    and agreements relating to Investment Related Property in
                    this Agreement or elsewhere herein or in the Indenture, each
                    Grantor shall be entitled to exercise or refrain from
                    exercising any and all voting and other consensual rights
                    pertaining to the Investment Related Property or any part
                    thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of
                    this Agreement or the Indenture; provided, (i) with respect
                    to Investment Related Property in the United States, no
                    Grantor shall exercise or refrain from exercising any such
                    right if the Joint Collateral Agent shall have notified such
                    Grantor that, in the Joint Collateral Agent's reasonable
                    judgment, such action would have a Material Adverse Effect
                    on the value of the material Investment Related Property or
                    any material part thereof and (ii) with respect to
                    Investment Related Property that is not located in the
                    United States,

                                       25
<Page>

                    after written notification from the Joint Collateral Agent,
                    no Grantor shall exercise or refrain from exercising any
                    such right if, such action could reasonably have a Material
                    Adverse Effect on the value of the material Investment
                    Related Property or any material part thereof and; and
                    provided further, such Grantor shall give the Joint
                    Collateral Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior
                    written notice of the manner in which it intends to
                    exercise, or the reasons for refraining from exercising, any
                    such right; it being understood, however, that neither the
                    voting by such Grantor of any Pledged Stock for, or such
                    Grantor's consent to, the election of directors (or similar
                    governing body) at a regularly scheduled annual or other
                    meeting of stockholders or with respect to incidental
                    matters at any such meeting, nor such Grantor's consent to
                    or approval of any action otherwise permitted under this
                    Agreement and the Indenture, shall be deemed inconsistent
                    with the terms of this Agreement or the Indenture within the
                    meaning of this Section 4(c)(4), and no notice of any such
                    voting or consent need be given to the Joint Collateral
                    Agent; and

                           (2)  the Joint Collateral Agent shall promptly
                    execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered)
                    to each Grantor all proxies, and other instruments as such
                    Grantor may from time to time reasonably request for the
                    purpose of enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and
                    other consensual rights when and to the extent which it is
                    entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (1) above;

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default:

                           (1)  all rights of each Grantor to exercise or
                    refrain from exercising the voting and other consensual
                    rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise
                    pursuant hereto shall cease and all such rights shall
                    thereupon become vested in the Joint Collateral Agent who
                    shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting
                    and other consensual rights; and

                           (2)  in order to permit the Joint Collateral Agent to
                    exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it may
                    be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all
                    dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled
                    to receive hereunder: (1) each Grantor shall promptly
                    execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered)
                    to the Joint Collateral Agent all proxies, dividend payment
                    orders and other instruments as the Joint Collateral Agent
                    may from time to time reasonably request and (2) each
                    Grantor acknowledges that the Joint Collateral Agent may
                    utilize the power of attorney set forth in Section 6.

            (d)     MATERIAL CONTRACTS.

                    (i)    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Each Grantor hereby
            represents and warrants, on each Representation Date, that:

                           (1)  Schedule IV(A) hereto (as such schedule may be
                    amended or supplemented from time to time) sets forth all of
                    the Material Contracts to which such Grantor has rights;

                           (2)  the Material Contracts have been duly
                    authorized, executed and delivered by all the Grantors party
                    thereto, are in full force and effect and to the

                                       26
<Page>

                    knowledge of the Grantors are binding upon and enforceable
                    against all parties thereto in accordance with their
                    respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency
                    reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or
                    affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and
                    except to the extent that availability of the remedy of
                    specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the
                    discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
                    may be brought; provided, however, that except as otherwise
                    specified on Schedule IV hereto, on the date hereof no
                    obligor under any Material Contract is currently the subject
                    of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. There exists (i)
                    no payment default under any Material Contract and (ii) no
                    other default under any Material Contract which would permit
                    termination of such Material Contract by any party thereto;
                    and

                           (3)  except for those Material Contracts specifically
                    identified on Schedule IV(B) hereto as Material Contracts
                    which prohibit assignments or require consent or notice to
                    any Person in connection with the assignment, no Material
                    Contract prohibits assignment or requires consent of or
                    notice to any Person in connection with the assignment to
                    the Joint Collateral Agent hereunder, except such as has
                    been given or made. With respect to those Material Contracts
                    specified on Schedule IV(B) hereto, each applicable Grantor
                    will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
                    required consent to the security interest of the Joint
                    Collateral Agent hereunder.

                    (ii)   COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.  Each Grantor hereby
            covenants and agrees that:

                           (1)  the Joint Collateral Agent may at any time
                    notify, or require any Grantor to so notify, the
                    counterparty on any Material Contract of the security
                    interest of the Joint Collateral Agent therein. In addition,
                    after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
                    of Default, the Joint Collateral Agent may upon written
                    notice to the applicable Grantor, notify, or require any
                    Grantor to notify, the counterparty to make all payments
                    under the Material Contracts directly to the Joint
                    Collateral Agent;

                           (2)  each Grantor shall deliver promptly to the Joint
                    Collateral Agent a copy of each material demand, notice or
                    document received by it relating in any way to any default
                    or event of default under a Material Contract;

                           (3)  each Grantor shall deliver promptly to the Joint
                    Collateral Agent, and in any event within twenty (20)
                    Business Days, after (1) any Material Contract of such
                    Grantor is terminated or amended in a manner that is
                    materially adverse to such Grantor or (2) any new Material
                    Contract is entered into by such Grantor, a written
                    statement describing such event, with copies of such
                    material amendments or new contracts, delivered to the Joint
                    Collateral Agent (to the extent such delivery is permitted
                    by the terms of any such Material Contract), provided, no
                    prohibition on delivery shall be effective if it were
                    bargained for by such Grantor with the intent of avoiding

                           (6)  no action or proceeding before any court or
                    administrative authority in pending or, to the best of

                    Grantor's rights to own, use, or license to other parties
                    any Intellectual Property owned by a Grantor;

                           (7)  except where the failure to do so could not
                    reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
                    each Grantor has been using required statutory notice of
                    registration in connection with its use of registered
                    Trademarks, proper marking practices in connection with the

                    reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
                    each Grantor uses commercially reasonable standards of

                    reasonable standards of quality;

                           (9)  to each Grantor's knowledge, the conduct of such
                    Grantor's business does not infringe upon or misappropriate
                    any trademark, patent, copyright, trade secret or similar
                    intellectual property right owned or controlled by a third
                    party; no claim is pending, or to the best of such Grantor's
                    knowledge, threatened, that the conduct of such Grantor's
                    business or the use of any Intellectual Property owned or
                    used by Grantor violates the asserted rights of any other
                    party;

                           (10) to each Grantor's knowledge, no other party is

                    Intellectual Property owned or used by such Grantor;

                           (11) no settlement or consent, covenant not to sue,
                    nonassertion assurance, or release has been entered into by
                    such Grantor or to which such Grantor is bound that
                    adversely affects such Grantor's rights to own or use, or
                    grant to others the right to use, any material Intellectual
                    Property which could reasonably be expected to have a
                    Material Adverse Effect; and

                           (12) each Grantor has not made any agreements or
                    entered into any Contracts to (other than this Agreement)
                    mortgage, pledge, encumber, assign, sell, transfer, license
                    or grant an option for any material Intellectual Property
                    outside the ordinary course of business that has not been
                    terminated or released.

                    (ii)   COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. Each Grantor hereby
            covenants and agrees as follows:

                           (1)  Grantor shall not do any act or omit to do any
                    act whereby any of the Intellectual Property which is
                    material to the business of Grantor may lapse, or become
                    abandoned, dedicated to the public, or unenforceable, or
                    which could

                                       30

                    reasonably be expected to adversely affect the validity,
                    grant, or enforceability of the security interest granted
                    therein;

                           (2)  at the Joint Collateral Agent's request Grantor
                    shall, or with not less than fifteen (15) days' notice to
                    the Joint Collateral Agent prior to filing any copyright
                    application of the details of such proposed application (or
                    shorter notice period, to the extent that delaying the
                    filing of the copyright application would adversely affect
                    the Grantor's rights to enforce its copyright against an
                    alleged infringer), Grantor may, apply to register any
                    unregistered Copyrightable work which is material to the
                    business of Grantor, in the United States Copyright Office
                    and; in each case, Grantor shall, concurrently with such
                    notice, execute and deliver to the Joint Collateral Agent a
                    completed Pledge Supplement, substantially in the form of
                    Annex A attached hereto, together with all Supplements to
                    Schedules thereto or signed counterpart of a Copyright
                    Security Agreement substantially in the form of Annex D,
                    together with all supplements to the schedules thereto;

                           (3)  it shall promptly notify the Joint Collateral
                    Agent if it knows or has reason to know that any item of
                    material Intellectual Property that is material to the
                    business of any Grantor is likely to become or be (a) other
                    than as a result of the expiration in the ordinary course of
                    a non-renewable term, abandoned or dedicated to the public
                    or placed in the public domain, or invalid or unenforceable,
                    (b) subject to any adverse determination or development
                    (including the institution of proceedings) in any action or
                    proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
                    the United States Copyright Office, and state registry, any
                    foreign counterpart of the foregoing, or any court arbitral
                    tribunal or regulatory agency, or (c) within the statutory
                    period in which statutory termination rights can be
                    exercised;

                           (4)  subject to clause (2) above, it shall take all
                    reasonable steps in the United States Patent and Trademark

                    registry and each foreign counterpart of the foregoing, to
                    pursue any application and maintain any registration of each
                    material Trademark, Patent, and Copyright owned by any
                    Grantor and which is now or shall become included in the
                    Collateral including, but not limited to, those items on
                    Schedule VI(A), (C) and (E) (as each may be amended or
                    supplemented from time to time);

                           (5)  in the event that, to the Grantor's knowledge,
                    any material Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed to
                    any Grantor is infringed, misappropriated, or diluted by
                    another party, such Grantor shall promptly take all
                    commercially reasonable actions to stop such infringement,
                    misappropriation, or dilution and protect its rights in such
                    Intellectual Property including, but not limited to, the
                    initiation of a suit for injunctive relief and to recover
                    damages;

                           (6)  to the extent required to prevent material
                    Trademarks from becoming invalid, each Grantor shall
                    maintain the level of the quality of products sold and
                    services rendered under any Trademark, and each Grantor
                    shall take all steps necessary to insure that licensees of
                    such Trademarks use such standards of quality;

                                       31

                           (7)  it shall take all commercially reasonable steps
                    required to protect the secrecy and proprietary nature of
                    all material Trade Secrets, including, without limitation,
                    entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and
                    labeling and restricting access to secret information and
                    documents;

                           (8)  it shall promptly (but in no event more than

            time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now
            existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the
            extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10)
            days notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale
            or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
            constitute reasonable notification. The Joint Collateral Agent shall
            not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice
            of sale having been given. The Joint Collateral Agent may adjourn
            any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the
            time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further
            notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.
            Each Grantor agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable
            for the Joint Collateral Agent to dispose of the Collateral or any
            portion thereof by using Internet sites that provide for the auction
            of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the
            reasonable capability of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers
            of assets. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Joint
            Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at
            which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was
            less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale,
            even if the Joint Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received
            and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. If the
            proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are
            insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations, each Grantor shall
            be liable for the deficiency and the fees of any attorneys employed
            by the Joint Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency. Each
            Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants
            contained in this Section will cause irreparable injury to the Joint
            Collateral Agent, that the Joint Collateral Agent has no adequate
            remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that
            each and every covenant contained in this Section shall be
            specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor
            hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an
            action for specific performance of such covenants except for a
            defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Secured
            Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated
            maturities. Nothing in this Section shall in any way alter the
            rights of the Joint Collateral Agent hereunder.

                    (iii)  The Joint Collateral Agent may dispose of the
            Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. The
            Joint Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any
            warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be
            considered to adversely effect the commercial reasonableness of any
            disposal of the Collateral.

                    (iv)   The Joint Collateral Agent shall have no obligation
            to marshal any of the Collateral.

            (b)     APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. All proceeds received by the Joint
Collateral Agent in respect of any sale or other disposition, any collection
from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Agency Agreement and
the Indenture.

            (c)     SALES ON CREDIT. If Joint Collateral Agent sells or
otherwise disposes of any of the Collateral upon credit, Grantor will be
credited only with payments actually made by purchaser and received by Joint
Collateral Agent and applied to indebtedness of the Purchaser. In the event the
purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Joint Collateral Agent may resell or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral and Grantor shall be credited with proceeds
of the sale.

            (d)     INVESTMENT RELATED PROPERTY.

                                       37
<Page>

                    (i)    Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
            prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable
            state securities laws, the Joint Collateral Agent may be compelled,
            with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Investment
            Related Property conducted without prior registration or
            qualification of such Investment Related Property under the
            Securities Act and/or such state securities laws, to limit
            purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire
            the Investment Related Property for their own account, for
            investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
            thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be
            at prices and on terms less favorable than those obtainable through
            a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering
            made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act)
            and, notwithstanding such circumstances, each Grantor agrees that
            any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a
            commercially reasonable manner and that the Joint Collateral Agent
            shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation
            to delay the sale of any Investment Related Property for the period
            of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a
            form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act
            or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer
            would, or should, agree to so register it. If the Joint Collateral
            Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the
            Investment Related Property, upon written request, each Grantor
            shall and shall cause each issuer of any Pledged Stock to be sold
            hereunder, each partnership and each limited liability company from
            time to time to furnish to the Joint Collateral Agent all such
            information as the Joint Collateral Agent may request in order to
            determine the number and nature of interest, shares or other
            instruments included in the Investment Related Property which may be
            sold by the Joint Collateral Agent in exempt transactions under the
            Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
            Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time in
            effect.

                    (ii)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
            Event of Default, the Joint Collateral Agent shall have the right to
            apply the balance from any Asset Sale Proceeds Account or instruct
            the bank at which any Asset Sale Proceeds Account is maintained to
            pay the balance of any Asset Sale Proceeds Account to or for the
            benefit of the Joint Collateral Agent.

            (e)     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                    (i)    Anything contained herein to the contrary
            notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of
            an Event of Default:

                           (1)  the Joint Collateral Agent shall have the right
                    (but not the obligation) to bring suit or otherwise commence
                    any action or proceeding in the name of any Grantor, the
                    Joint Collateral Agent or otherwise, in the Joint Collateral
                    Agent's sole discretion, to enforce any Intellectual
                    Property, in which event such Grantor shall, at the request
                    of the Joint Collateral Agent, do any and all lawful acts
                    and execute any and all documents required by the Joint
                    Collateral Agent in aid of such enforcement and such Grantor
                    shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and indemnify the
                    Joint Collateral Agent as provided in the Section in this
                    Agreement relating to indemnity and expenses (Section 11
                    hereof) in connection with the exercise of its rights under
                    this Section, and, to the extent that the Joint Collateral
                    Agent shall elect not to bring suit to enforce any
                    Intellectual Property as provided in this Section, each
                    Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by
                    action, suit, proceeding or otherwise, to prevent

                                       38
<Page>

                    the infringement or misappropriation of any of the
                    Intellectual Property by others and for that purpose agrees
                    to diligently maintain any action, suit or proceeding
                    against any Person so infringing or misappropriating as
                    shall be necessary to prevent such infringement or
                    misappropriation;

                           (2)  upon written demand from the Joint Collateral
                    Agent, each Grantor shall grant, assign, convey or otherwise
                    transfer to the Joint Collateral Agent or such Joint
                    Collateral Agent's designee all of such Grantor's right,
                    title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property and
                    shall execute and deliver to the Joint Collateral Agent such
                    documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the
                    intent and purposes of this Agreement;

                           (3)  each Grantor agrees that such an assignment
                    and/or recording shall be applied to reduce the Secured
                    Obligations outstanding only to the extent that the Joint
                    Collateral Agent receives proceeds in respect of the sale
                    of, or other realization upon, the Intellectual Property in
                    conformance with Article 4 of the Collateral Agency
                    Agreement;

                           (4)  within five (5) Business Days after written
                    notice from the Joint Collateral Agent, each Grantor shall
                    make available to the Joint Collateral Agent, to the extent
                    within such Grantor's power and authority, such personnel in
                    such Grantor's employ or retention on the date of such Event
                    of Default as the Joint Collateral Agent may reasonably
                    designate, by name, title or job responsibility, to permit
                    such Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to
                    produce, advertise and sell the products and services sold
                    or delivered by such Grantor under or in connection with the
                    Intellectual Property, such persons to be available to
                    perform their prior functions on the Joint Collateral
                    Agent's behalf and to be compensated by the Joint Collateral
                    Agent at such Grantor's expense on a per diem, pro-rata
                    basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure
                    applicable to each as of the date of such Event of Default;
                    and

                           (5)  the Joint Collateral Agent shall have the right
                    to notify, or require each Grantor to notify, any obligors
                    with respect to amounts due or to become due to such Grantor
                    in respect of the Intellectual Property and Intellectual
                    Property Licenses, of the existence of the security interest
                    created herein, to direct such obligors to make payment of
                    all such amounts directly to the Joint Collateral Agent in
                    conformance with Section 4(d)(ii)(1) of this Agreement, and,
                    upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor,
                    to enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust,
                    settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the
                    same manner and to the same extent as such Grantor might
                    have done;

                           (6)  all amounts and proceeds (including checks and
                    other instruments) received by any Grantor in respect of
                    amounts due to such Grantor in respect of the Collateral or
                    any portion thereof shall be received in trust for the
                    benefit of the Joint Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be
                    segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be
                    forthwith paid over or delivered to the Joint Collateral
                    Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary
                    endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral and applied as
                    provided by the Section in this Agreement relating to cash
                    proceeds (Section 7 hereof); and

                                       39
<Page>

                           (7)  Grantors shall not adjust, settle or compromise
                    the amount or payment of any such amount or release wholly
                    or partly any obligor with respect thereto or allow any
                    credit or discount thereon.

                    (ii)   If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and,
            by reason of cure, waiver, modification, amendment or otherwise, no
            longer be continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have
            occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment or other transfer to
            the Joint Collateral Agent of any rights, title and interests in and
            to the Intellectual Property shall have been previously made and
            shall have become absolute and effective, and (iv) the Secured
            Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon
            the written request of any Grantor, the Joint Collateral Agent shall
            promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor, at such Grantor's sole
            cost and expense, such assignments or other transfer instruments as
            may be necessary to reassign to such Grantor any such rights, title
            and interests as may have been assigned to the Joint Collateral
            Agent as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof (including a
            lease or license granted pursuant to Section 13.05 of the Indenture)
            that may have been made by the Joint Collateral Agent; provided,
            after giving effect to such reassignment, the Joint Collateral
            Agent's security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all
            other rights and remedies of the Joint Collateral Agent granted
            hereunder, shall continue to be in full force and effect; and
            provided further, the rights, title and interests so reassigned
            shall be free and clear of any Liens granted by or on behalf of the
            Joint Collateral Agent.

                    (iii)  Solely for the purpose of enabling the Joint
            Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Section
            7 and at such time as the Joint Collateral Agent shall be lawfully
            entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby
            grants to the Joint Collateral Agent, to the extent it has the right
            to do so, an irrevocable, nonexclusive worldwide license
            (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to
            such Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to sufficient
            rights to quality control and inspection in favor of the trademark
            owner to avoid the risk of invalidation of said Trademarks, to use,
            operate under, license, or sublicense any Intellectual Property now
            or hereafter owned by or licensed to such Grantor.

SECTION 8.  JOINT COLLATERAL AGENT

            The Joint Collateral Agent has been appointed to act as Joint
Collateral Agent in accordance with the Collateral Agency Agreement and shall
have the rights and duties specified therein.

SECTION 9.  CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF SECURED OBLIGATIONS

            This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the
Collateral and shall remain in full force and effect until terminated in
accordance with the Indenture and any Parity Lien Credit Document, be binding
upon each Grantor, its successors and assigns, and inure, together with the
rights and remedies of the Joint Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of
the Joint Collateral Agent and its successors, transferees and assigns. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of the
Transaction Documents, each Secured Party may assign or otherwise transfer any
Secured Obligations held by it to any other Person, and such other Person shall
thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to each
Secured Party herein or otherwise. As to any particular Collateral that is sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture and any Parity Lien Credit Document, such Collateral shall be released
in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and any Parity Lien Credit
Document; provided, however, that the security

                                       40
<Page>

interest shall continue in any proceeds of such disposition. Upon the
termination of the security interest with respect to all Secured Obligations in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Parity Lien Credit Documents,
the security interest granted hereby shall terminate hereunder and of record,
the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created hereby, and all rights
to the Collateral shall revert and be deemed reassigned to Grantors. Upon any
such termination the Joint Collateral Agent shall, at Grantors' expense,
authorize, execute and deliver to Grantors such documents as Grantors shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination.

SECTION 10. STANDARD OF CARE; JOINT COLLATERAL AGENT MAY PERFORM

            The powers conferred on the Joint Collateral Agent hereunder are
solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and the interests of the
Secured Parties and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such
powers. Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of any
Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by
it hereunder and subject to the Joint Collateral Agent complying with all laws
and performing all acts as may be required by any governmental authority,
including, without limitation, protecting classified assets (including, without
limitation, information, contracts and programs) and export controlled
information in the manner lawfully requested by such governmental authority, the
Joint Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the
taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any
other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Joint Collateral Agent shall be
deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equal to that which the Joint Collateral Agent accords its own
property. Neither the Joint Collateral Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize
upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be
under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the
request of any Grantor or otherwise. If any Grantor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein, the Joint Collateral Agent may itself perform, or
cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Joint Collateral
Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by each Grantor under
the Section in this Agreement relating to the payment of expenses (Section 12(b)
hereof).

SECTION 11. INDEMNITY

            (a)     Each Grantor agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees'
selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless each Indemnitee, from
and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities in any way relating to,
growing out of or resulting from this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including without limitation enforcement of this
Agreement), except to the extent such claims, losses or liabilities result from
such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            (b)     The obligations of each Grantor in this Section 11 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of such Grantor's
other obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and any other Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS

            (a)     NOTICES. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any

Grantor or Trustee, shall be sent to such Person's address as set forth in
Section 15.02 of the Indenture or in the other relevant Transaction Document or

telefacsimile or telex, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United
States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided, no notice to
Joint Collateral Agent shall be effective until received by Joint Collateral
Agent.

            (b)     EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated under
the Transaction Documents shall be consummated, Grantors agree to pay promptly
all the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of preparation of the
Transaction Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications thereto; all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for
the Grantors; the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to
Joint Collateral Agent (in each case including allocated costs of internal
counsel) in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
administration of the Transaction Documents and any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications thereto and any other documents or matters
requested by the Grantors; all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of
creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Joint Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of each Secured Party pursuant hereto, including filing and recording

Collateral Agent may reasonably request in respect of the Collateral or the

and its counsel) in connection with the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; all other actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by each
Agent in connection with the syndication of the Secured Obligations and
commitments and the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Transaction
Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto
and the transactions contemplated thereby; and after the occurrence of a Default
or an Event of Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees (including allocated costs of internal counsel) and costs of settlement,
incurred by Joint Collateral Agent in enforcing any Secured Obligations of or in
collecting any payments due from any Grantor hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents by reason of such Default or Event of Default (including
in connection with the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any
of the Collateral) or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
credit arrangements provided hereunder in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant
to any insolvency or bankruptcy cases or proceedings.

            (c)     AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

                    (i)    JOINT COLLATERAL AGENT'S CONSENT. Subject to Section
            12(c)(ii) and the Indenture, no amendment, modification, termination
            or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any
            departure by any Grantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective
            without the written concurrence of the Joint Collateral Agent.

                    (ii)   NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay
            on the part of the Joint Collateral Agent in the exercise of any
            power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Transaction
            Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed
            to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any
            single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege
            preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
            right or privilege. All rights, powers and remedies existing under
            this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents are cumulative,
            and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.
            Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay in exercising,
            any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such
            right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor
            shall it preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or
            remedy.

            (d)     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns including all
persons who become bound as debtor to this Agreement. No Grantor shall, without
the prior written consent of the Joint Collateral Agent, assign any right, duty
or obligation hereunder.

            (e)     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants hereunder shall be
given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such
action is taken or condition exists.

            (f)     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS. All
representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the
execution and delivery hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law
to the contrary, the agreements of each Grantor set forth in Sections 11 and
12(b) shall survive the payment of the Secured Obligations and the termination
hereof.

            (g)     MARSHALING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Joint Collateral Agent shall
not be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Grantor or any
other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations.

            (h)     SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation
hereunder shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

            (i)     HEADINGS. Section headings herein are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part hereof for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

            (j)     APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

            (k)     CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT
AGAINST ANY GRANTOR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING HERETO OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY
EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH GRANTOR, FOR ITSELF AND IN
CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS; WAIVES
ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL,
RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO THE APPLICABLE GRANTOR AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12(a); AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (a)
ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICABLE GRANTOR
IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE
AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT; AND AGREES JOINT COLLATERAL AGENT RETAINS

MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY GRANTOR IN THE
COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

            (l)     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY
AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF
DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED
FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY
REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 12(l) AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND
THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS HERETO. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS
A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

            (m)     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

            (n)     EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective upon
the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and receipt
by Grantors and the Joint Collateral Agent of written or telephonic notification
of such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

            (o)     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Grantors and the
Joint Collateral Agent and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
between such parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Accordingly, the Transaction Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of
prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are
no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.
