regulations adopted thereunder) to or for the benefit of the Executive under this Agreement, or under any other agreement, plan or arrangement, shall be deemed to be an "excess parachute payment" as
defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. It is agreed that the present value of the Total Payments shall not exceed an amount equal to two and ninety-nine hundredths (2.99) times the
Executive's Base Period Income, which is the maximum amount which the Executive may receive without becoming subject to the tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or which the Company may pay
without loss of deduction under Section&nbsp;280G(a)&nbsp;of the Code. Present value for purposes of this Agreement shall be calculated in accordance with the regulations issued under
Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. Within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following delivery of the Notice of Termination or notice by the Company to the Executive of its belief that there is a payment or
benefit due the Executive which will result in an excess parachute payment as defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code, the Executive and the Company shall, at the Company's expense, obtain such
opinions as more fully described hereafter, which need not be unqualified, of legal counsel and certified public accountants or a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants. The Executive
shall select said legal counsel, certified public accountants and executive compensation consultants; provided, however, that if the Company does not accept one (1)&nbsp;or more of the parties
selected by the Executive, the Company shall provide the Executive with the names of such legal counsel, certified public accountants and/or executive compensation consultants as the Company may
select; provided, further, however, that if the Executive does not accept the party or parties selected by the Company, the legal counsel, certified public accountants and/or executive compensation
consultants selected by the Executive and the Company, respectively, shall select the legal counsel, certified public accountants and/or executive compensation consultants, whichever is applicable,
who shall provide the opinions required by this Section&nbsp;13(d). The opinions required hereunder shall set forth (a)&nbsp;the amount of the Base Period Income of the Executive, (b)&nbsp;the
present value of Total Payments and (c)&nbsp;the amount and present value of any excess parachute payments. In the event that such opinions determine that there would be an excess parachute payment,
the Termination Payment or any other payment determined by such counsel to be includable in Total Payments shall be reduced or eliminated as specified by the Executive in writing delivered to the
Company within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of his or her receipt of such
opinions or, if the Executive fails to so notify the Company, then as the Company shall reasonably determine, so that under the bases of calculation set forth in such opinions there will be no excess
parachute payment. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;13(d), including the calculations, notices and opinions provided for herein shall be based upon the conclusive presumption that the
compensation and other benefits, including but not limited to the Gross Income, earned on or after the date of a Change of Control by the Executive pursuant to the Company's compensation programs if
such payments would have been made in the future in any event, even though the timing of such payment is triggered by the Change of Control, are reasonable compensation for services rendered prior to
the Change of Control; provided, however, that in the event legal counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section&nbsp;13(d), a firm of recognized executive compensation
consultants, selected by the Executive and the Company pursuant to the procedures set forth above, shall provide an opinion, upon which such legal counsel may rely, as to the reasonableness of any
item of compensation as reasonable compensation for services rendered prior to the Change of Control by the Executive. In the event that the provisions of Sections&nbsp;280G and 4999 of the Code are
repealed without succession, this Section&nbsp;13(d) shall be of no further force or effect. </FONT></P>
