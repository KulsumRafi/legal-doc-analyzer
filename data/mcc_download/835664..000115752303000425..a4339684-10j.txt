Account shall be registered in the name of Lender, indorsed to Lender or in
blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of Lender
and in no case will any financial asset credited to any Account be registered in
the name of Borrower, payable to the order of Borrower or specially indorsed to
Borrower.

     Section 2.4 Permitted Investments. Sums on deposit in the Accounts shall
not be invested except in Permitted Investments. Provided that an Event of
Default shall not have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall have the right
to direct Agent to invest sums on deposit in the Accounts in Permitted
Investments; provided, however, in no event shall Borrower direct Agent to make
a Permitted Investment if the maturity date of that Permitted Investment is
later than the date on which the invested sums are required for payment of an
obligation for which the Account was created. Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes and directs Agent to apply any income earned from Permitted
Investments to the respective Accounts. The amount of actual losses sustained on
a liquidation of a Permitted Investment shall be deposited into the Lockbox
Account by Borrower no later than three (3) Business Day(s) following such
liquidation. Borrower shall be responsible for payment of any federal, state or
local income or other tax applicable to income earned from Permitted
Investments. The Accounts shall be assigned the federal tax identification
number of Borrower, which number is 59-2898045.

Documents (all such obligations, collectively, the "Obligations"), Borrower
hereby grants to Lender a first priority continuing security interest in and to
the following property of Borrower, whether now owned or existing or hereafter
or arising and regardless of where located (all of the same, collectively, the
"Collateral"):

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

          (i)  the Accounts, all financial assets (as defined in Section
               8-102(a) of the UCC (hereinafter defined), cash, checks, drafts,
               certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time deposited
               or held in the Accounts from time to time including, without
               limitation, all deposits or wire transfers made to the Accounts;

          (ii) any and all amounts invested in Permitted Investments;

          (iii) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property
               from time to time received, receivable or otherwise payable in
               respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the foregoing; and

          (iv) to the extent not covered by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
               all "proceeds" (as defined under the Uniform Commercial Code as
               in effect in the State in which the Accounts are located (the
               "UCC")) of any or all of the foregoing.

     (b) Lender and Agent, as agent for Lender, shall have with respect to the
Collateral, in addition to the rights and remedies herein set forth, all of the
rights and remedies available to a secured party under the UCC, as if such
rights and remedies were fully set forth herein.

     (c) If at any time Agent shall receive an "entitlement order" (within the
meaning of Section 8-102(a)(8) of the Revised UCC) issued by Lender and relating
to any Account, Agent shall comply with such entitlement order without further
consent by Lender, Borrower, Beneficiary or any other Person.

     (d) In the event that Agent has or subsequently obtains by agreement,
operation of law or otherwise a security interest in any Account or any security
entitlement, financial asset, investment property (as such terms are defined in
the UCC) or other asset credited thereto, Agent hereby agrees that such security
interest shall be subordinate to the security interest of Lender.

     Section 5.2 Financing Statement; Further Assurances. Simultaneously
herewith, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender for filing a financing
statement or statements in connection with the Collateral in the form required
by Lender to properly perfect Lender's security interest therein (to the extent
the Collateral is the type that can be perfected by filing a financing
statement). Borrower agrees that at any time and from time to time, at the
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly execute and deliver all further
instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be reasonably
necessary to perfect and protect any security interest granted or purported to
be granted hereby (including, without limitation, any security interest in and
to any Permitted Investments) or to enable Agent or Lender to exercise and
enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral.

     Section 5.3 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement shall create a
continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall remain in full force
and effect until payment in full of the Obligations. Upon payment and
performance in full of the Obligations, this Agreement shall terminate and
Borrower shall be entitled to the return, upon its request and at its expense,
of such of the Collateral as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied
pursuant to the terms hereof, and Agent and/or Lender shall execute such
instruments and documents as may be reasonably requested by Borrower to evidence
such termination and the release of the lien hereof.

VI. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF LENDER AND AGENT

     Section 6.1 Reasonable Care. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the
custody thereof or as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither Agent nor
Lender shall have any duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control as
agent therefor or bailee thereof or any income thereon or the preservation of
rights against any Person or otherwise with respect thereto. Agent and Lender
each shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which Agent or Lender accords its own
property, it being understood that Lender shall not be liable or responsible for
any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in value
thereof, by reason of the act or omission of Agent or Lender, its Affiliates,
agents, employees or bailees, except to the extent that such loss or damage
results from Agent's or Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
provided that nothing in this Article VI shall be deemed to relieve Agent from
the duties and standard of care which, as a commercial bank, it generally owes
to depositors. Neither Lender nor Agent shall have any liability for any loss
resulting from the investment of funds in Permitted Investments in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except for damages resulting
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such parties.

     Section 6.2 Indemnity. Agent, in its capacity as agent hereunder, shall be
responsible for the performance only of such duties as are specifically set
forth herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Agent
shall not be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve
it in expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof,
or to advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Agent and
Lender, their respective employees and officers harmless from and against any
loss, cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) incurred by Agent or Lender in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent that such loss or damage
results from Agent's or Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct or a
breach of Section 6.1 hereof.

     Section 6.3 Reliance. Agent shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other
paper, document or signature believed by it in the exercise of reasonable
judgment to be genuine, and it may be assumed in the exercise of reasonable
judgment that any person purporting to act on behalf of any Person giving any of
the foregoing in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized
to do so. Agent may consult with counsel, and the opinion of such counsel shall
be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken
or suffered by it hereunder and in good faith in accordance therewith. Agent
shall not be liable for any act or omission done or omitted to be done by Agent
in the exercise of reasonable judgment in reliance upon any instruction,
direction or certification received by Agent and without gross negligence or
willful or reckless misconduct.

     Section 6.4 Resignation of Agent. (a) Agent shall have the right to resign
as Agent hereunder upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Borrower and
Lender, and in the event of such resignation, Lender shall appoint a successor
Agent which must be an Eligible Institution. No such resignation by Agent shall
become effective until a successor Agent shall have accepted such appointment
and executed an instrument by which it shall have assumed all of the rights and

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

obligations of Agent hereunder. If no such successor Agent is appointed within
sixty (60) days after receipt of the resigning Agent's notice of resignation,
the resigning Agent may petition a court for the appointment of a successor
Agent.

     (b) In connection with any resignation by Agent, (i) the resigning Agent
shall, at the sole cost of Borrower, (A) duly assign, transfer and deliver to
the successor Agent this Agreement and all cash and Permitted Investments held
by it hereunder, (B) execute such financing statements and other instruments as
may be necessary to assign to the successor Agent the security interest in the
Collateral existing in favor of the retiring Agent hereunder and to otherwise
give effect to such succession and (C) take such other actions as may be
reasonably required by Lender, Borrower or the successor Agent in connection
with the foregoing and (ii) the successor Agent shall establish in its name, as
secured party, cash collateral accounts, which shall become the Accounts for
purposes of this Agreement upon the succession of such Agent.

     (c) Lender at its sole discretion shall have the right, upon thirty (30)
days notice to Agent, and, at its sole cost and expense, to substitute Agent
with a successor Agent that satisfies the requirements of an Eligible
Institution or to have one or more of the Accounts held by another Eligible
Institution, provided that such successor Agent shall perform the duties of
Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 6.5 Lender Appointed Attorney-In-Fact. Borrower hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Lender as Borrower's true and lawful attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, to execute, acknowledge and deliver any
instruments and to exercise and enforce every right, power, remedy, option and
privilege of Borrower with respect to the Collateral, and do in the name, place
and stead of Borrower, all such acts, things and deeds for and on behalf of and
in the name of Borrower, which Borrower could or might do or which Agent or
Lender may deem reasonably necessary to more fully vest in Lender the rights and
remedies provided for herein and to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, unless Lender deems the situation to be an emergency, Lender
will not exercise such rights unless Borrower has failed to do so within three
(3) days of notice thereof from Lender. The foregoing powers of attorney are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

     Section 6.6 Acknowledgment of Lien/Offset Rights. Agent hereby acknowledges
and agrees that (a) the Accounts shall be held by Agent in the name of Lender,
(b) all funds held in the Accounts shall be held for the benefit of Lender, (c)
Borrower has granted to Lender a first priority security interest in the
Collateral, (d) Agent shall not disburse any funds from the Accounts except as
provided herein, and (e) Agent shall invest and reinvest any balance of the
Accounts in Permitted Investments. Agent hereby waives any right of offset,
banker's lien or similar rights against, or any assignment, security interest or
other interest in, the Collateral.

VII. REMEDIES

     Section 7.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender or Agent, as agent for Lender, may:

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

     (a) without notice to Borrower, except as required by law, and at any time
or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the
Collateral against the Obligations or any part thereof;

     (b) in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, exercise any
and all rights and remedies available to it under this Agreement, and/or as a
secured party under the UCC and/or under any other applicable law; and

     (c) demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise,
adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon the Collateral (or any portion
thereof) as Lender may determine in its sole discretion.

     Section 7.2 Waiver. Borrower hereby expressly waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind in
connection with this Agreement or the Collateral. Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that ten (10) days' prior written notice of the time and place of any
public sale of the Collateral or any other intended disposition thereof shall be
reasonable and sufficient notice to Borrower within the meaning of the UCC.

VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 8.1 Transfers and Other Liens. Except as permitted hereby or by the
Loan Agreement, Borrower agrees that it will not (i) sell or otherwise dispose
of any of the Collateral or (ii) create or permit to exist any Lien upon or with
respect to all or any of the Collateral, except for the Lien granted under this
Agreement.

     Section 8.2 Lender's Right to Perform Borrower's Obligations; No Liability
of Lender. If Borrower fails to perform any of the covenants or obligations
contained herein, and such failure shall continue for a period five (5) Business
Days after Borrower's receipt of written notice thereof from Lender, Lender may
itself perform, or cause performance of, such covenants or obligations, and the
reasonable expenses of Lender incurred in connection therewith shall be payable
by Borrower to Lender. Notwithstanding Lender's right to perform certain
obligations of Borrower, it is acknowledged and agreed that Borrower retains
control of the Properties and operation thereof and notwithstanding anything
contained herein or Agent's or Lender's exercise of any of its rights or
remedies hereunder, under the Loan Documents or otherwise at law or in equity,
neither Agent nor Lender shall be deemed to be a mortgagee-in-possession nor
shall Lender be subject to any liability with respect to the Properties or
otherwise based upon any claim of lender liability.

     Section 8.3 No Waiver. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and may be exercised independently
or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any other right or remedy provided at
law or in equity. No failure to exercise or delay by Agent or Lender in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall
impair or prohibit the exercise of any such rights or remedies in the future or
be deemed to constitute a waiver or limitation of any such right or remedy or
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy granted to Agent and/or Lender
hereunder or by law may be exercised by Agent and/or Lender at any time and from
time to time, and as often as Agent

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

and/or Lender may deem it expedient. Any and all of Agent's and/or Lender's
rights with respect to the lien and security interest granted hereunder shall
continue unimpaired, and Borrower shall be and remain obligated in accordance
with the terms hereof, notwithstanding (a) any proceeding of Borrower under the
Federal Bankruptcy Code or any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization laws or
statutes of any state, (b) the release or substitution of Collateral at any
time, or of any rights or interests therein or (c) any delay, extension of time,
renewal, compromise or other indulgence granted by the Agent and/or Lender in
the event of any default, with respect to the Collateral or otherwise hereunder.
No delay or extension of time by Agent and/or Lender in exercising any power of
sale, option or other right or remedy hereunder, and no notice or demand which
may be given to or made upon Borrower by Agent and/or Lender, shall constitute a
waiver thereof, or limit, impair or prejudice Agent's and/or Lender's right,
without notice or demand, to take any action against Borrower or to exercise any
other power of sale, option or any other right or remedy.

     Section 8.4 Expenses. The Collateral shall secure, and Borrower shall pay
to Agent and Lender and/or Agent's and Lender's counsel on demand, from time to
time, all reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, and transfer, recording and filing
fees, taxes and other charges) of, or incidental to, the creation or perfection
of any lien or security interest granted or intended to be granted hereby, the
custody, care, sale, transfer, administration, collection of or realization on
the Collateral, or in any way relating to the enforcement, protection or
preservation of the rights or remedies of Agent and/or Lender under this
Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, or the other Loan
Documents. Standard and customary fees and charges associated with the Accounts
shall be included on a monthly consolidated account analysis statement which
Agent shall submit to Borrower for Borrower's payment. This statement shall set
forth the fees and charges payable for such month, including, but not limited to
reasonable fees and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and be accompanied by reasonably detailed supporting documentation.
Agent shall be entitled to charge the Accounts for such fees and expenses as
indicated by the analysis statement.

     Section 8.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire and
final agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and may not be changed, terminated or otherwise varied, except by a writing duly
executed by the parties.

     Section 8.6 No Waiver. No waiver of any term or condition of this
Agreement, whether by delay, omission or otherwise, shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by the party sought to be charged, and then such waiver shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

     Section 8.7 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

     Section 8.8 Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals
and other communications (any of the foregoing, a "Notice") required, permitted,
or desired to be given hereunder shall be in writing sent by telefax or by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or
