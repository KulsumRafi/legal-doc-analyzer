the contractor will not be penalized for such delays.

It is understood that should there be a reordering of priorities by the City,
some tasks may be cancelled, postponed or delayed, while other tasks substituted

log and through the development of new task orders. When such modifications are
by order of the City, the contractor will not be penalized for such changes but
will receive full compensation for all work performed.

associated deliverables due to the failure of the contractor that the contractor
shall reimburse the City for all or a percentage of the task cost already paid.
