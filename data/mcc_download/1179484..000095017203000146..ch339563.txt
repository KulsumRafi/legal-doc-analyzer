         provide the Acquirer with the final Intercompany Amount, which cannot
         be less than Euro 812,597, certified by the statutory auditors of the
         Company together with all documentation evidencing the proper
         transfer of the receivables to the Seller. If the final Intercompany
         Amount is lower than the Intercompany Amount as of August 31, 2002,
         (i.e. Euro 1,409,122), the part of the Purchase Price allocated to
         the Intercompany Amount will be reduced accordingly on an euro per
         euro basis and such adjusted Purchase Price will become the final
         Purchase Price. If the final Intercompany Amount is higher than the
         Intercompany Amount as of August 31, 2002 (i.e. Euro 1,409,122), the
         part of the Purchase Price allocated to the Intercompany Amount will
         be increased accordingly on an Euro by Euro basis. Such adjusted
         Purchase Price will become the final Purchase Price.

         Upon payment and assignment of the final Intercompany Amount, neither
         the Company, the Subsidiary, nor any other member of the Comdisco
         Group shall have any remaining reciprocal claim for repayment of any
         receivables and payables.

         The final Purchase Price shall bear interest at an annual rate equal
         to 4.183% and accruing during the period from the date hereof until
         the final Purchase Price is paid in full by the Acquirer to the
         Seller.

         Agreement") substantially in the form attached as Schedule 4.1 (r).
         The Seller will bear all costs and taxes induced by such transfer.

         Upon request of the Seller, the Acquirer shall cause the Company and
         the Subsidiary to reasonably assist the Seller after Completion for
         purposes of repossessing the CEG assets, which were leased by the
         company ASAT currently under bankruptcy proceedings.

4.2      Access and Information

4.2.1    The Seller shall procure that between the date hereof and the
         Completion Date, the Acquirer and its advisers are promptly given
         such information regarding the business, assets, liabilities,
         agreements and affairs of the Company and the Subsidiary as the
         Acquirer or its advisers may reasonably require in order to prepare
         an orderly transition following the Completion Date, provided,
         however, that any such access shall be conducted at the Acquirer's
         expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of the Seller's,
         the Company's or the Subsidiary's personnel and in such a manner as
         to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of this Agreement and of
         the Transaction and not to interfere with the normal operation of the
         business of the Seller, the Company or the Subsidiary.

4.2.2    The Seller shall make its best efforts to procure that between the
         date hereof and the Completion Date, the Company shall timely provide
         the Acquirer with the reports listed in Schedule 4.2.2.

4.3      Actions with a view to Completion

         Each Party shall (at its own expense) do or procure to be done all
         acts and things and/or execute or procure the execution of all
         documents, as is or may be reasonably required to complete all
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In particular (and
         without limiting the generality of the foregoing):

         (a)      the Seller shall cause special meetings of the relevant
                  corporate bodies of the Company to be validly convened for a
                  date not later than the Completion Date, the agenda of which
                  shall include the passing of all decisions required for
                  Completion;

         (b)      the Seller shall procure that all Intercompany Agreements
                  shall be terminated on the Completion Date.

4.4      The Seller's Trademarks and Logos

4.4.1    The Acquirer expressly agrees that (a) it is not purchasing,
         acquiring or otherwise obtaining, and the Acquirer, the Company and
         the Subsidiary will not, following the Completion Date, obtain or be
         entitled to retain any right, title or interest in the COMDISCO
         Trademark; use or otherwise employ the Seller's "COMDISCO" name or
         any part or variation of such name or anything confusingly similar
         thereto or suggesting that there is a relationship or affiliation
         between the Seller and the Acquirer, and between the Seller and the
         Company and the Subsidiary from and after the Completion, (b) none of
         the Company, the Subsidiary or the Acquirer or its affiliates shall
         make any use of such COMDISCO Trademark from and after the Completion
         and (c) each of the Acquirer and its affiliates shall not, directly
         or indirectly, attack the Seller's or its affiliates' rights or
         ownership in and to any of the Trademarks, including, without
         limitation, any registrations, or the validity of the Trademarks. All
         rights in the Trademarks other than those as may be specifically
         granted in the Ancillary Agreements are reserved to the Seller for
         its own use, benefit and disposition. For purposes of this Clause
         4.4, "Trademarks" means any Seller registered and unregistered
         trademarks, service marks, tradenames and business names (including
         rights in any trade dress) and applications for registration thereof,
         together with the goodwill symbolized thereby and associated
         therewith, including, without limitation, "IT CAP", "IT Trak" and
         "TRO".

4.4.2    The Seller shall grant the Company and the Subsidiary the right to
         use in the Territory the IT CAP, IT Trak and TRO Trademarks, as well
         as the CLASS software, after Completion pursuant to the terms of a
         Trademark and Software License Agreement substantially in the Agreed
         Form attached hereto as Schedule B which shall be entered into on the
         Completion Date.

         The Seller shall cause the Subsidiary to enter into a license
         agreement with Comdisco Deutschland regarding the use after
         Completion of certain softwares substantially in the Agreed Form
         attached hereto as Schedule D (the "German License Agreement").

4.5      Company Name Change.

         Between the date hereof and the Completion Date, the Seller and the
         Acquirer shall cooperate and use their commercially best efforts to
         cause the Company to change its corporate name from "COMDISCO FRANCE
         S.A." to a name not using the COMDISCO name as designated by the
         Acquirer in writing, to become effective on the Completion Date (the
         "Name Change"). The Acquirer shall communicate to the Seller the new
         name of the Company no more than five (5) Business Days prior to
         Completion so as to enable the Seller to effect the Name Change
         promptly after Completion. The Name Change shall be deemed effected
         upon filing for registration, with the Companies Register,
         corresponding to the Company's corporate domicile, of minutes of the
         extraordinary general shareholders' meeting of the Company.

4.6      Guarantee

         Comdisco Holding Company, Inc. jointly and severally guarantees the
         performance of this Agreement by the Seller, in compliance with its
         terms.

4.7      Insurance Policies

         The Seller shall have no obligation to continue the insurance
         coverage for the Company and the Subsidiary after the Completion Date
         and will no longer be responsible for any risks of the Company and
         the Subsidiary after the Completion Date. The Acquirer shall be
         responsible for arranging new insurance coverage effective from the
         Completion Date at its own risk and expense.

         The Seller and its affiliates shall retain the right to any credit or
         return premiums due, paid or payable in connection with the
         termination thereof.

         Consequently, in the event that the Company and/or the Subsidiary
         would receive after the Completion Date any payment in connection
         with the termination of the insurance coverage by the Seller, the
         Acquirer undertakes to cause the Company and/or the Subsidiary to pay
         promptly to the Seller the sum received from the insurers.

4.8      GE receivable

         The Seller represents and warrants that General Electric (GE) owes to
         the Company an amount of 3.2 million (three million and two hundred
         thousand) Euros pursuant to the sale of assets described in Schedule
         4.8. If on Completion Date GE has not paid that entire sum, a sum
         equal to 3.2 million Euros less what has already being paid to the
         Company by GE pursuant to the sale of assets described in Schedule
         4.8, (hereafter the "Balance"), shall be paid, Euro by Euro, by
         Seller to the Company on the same date.

         In the event that the Company would receive, prior to the Completion
         Date, from GE in total an amount exceeding 3.2 million Euros in
         relation to the sale of assets described in Schedule 4.8, the Company
         shall pay to the Seller the difference between the amount paid by GE
         and 3.2 million Euros.

         If the Seller pays to the Company any amount pursuant to the first
         paragraph above, it shall cause the Company to execute the
         corresponding transfer of receivable.

         In the event that the Company would receive, after the Completion
         Date, from GE, a payment in relation to the sale of assets described
         in Schedule 4.8, the Acquirer undertakes to cause the Company to pay
         promptly to the Seller the sum received by GE after the Completion
         Date.

4.9      Transitional Services Agreement

         On the Completion Date, the Seller and the Acquirer shall execute a
         Transitional Services Agreement substantially in the Agreed Form
         attached hereto as Schedule C, in relation with certain services
         which shall be provided by the Subsidiary and the Company to the
         Seller or its affiliates after the Completion Date.

4.10     European Michelin assets

         On the Completion Date or as soon as practicable after the Completion
         Date, the Parties shall execute (or will cause their respective
         relevant group companies to execute) a master agreement and local
         transfer agreements in connection with the acquisition by the
         Acquirer (or any of its group companies) of the other European
         Michelin assets and contracts, which shall be listed in a Schedule
         4.10 to be provided by the Seller as soon as possible after the date
         hereof and prior to the Completion Date, at the applicable NPV ("net
         present value") in each country (as at 31 August 2002) x 90%, minus
         corresponding rentals received up to their transfer. The Parties
         agree that the Acquirer shall not be obligated to purchase or cause
         its relevant group companies to purchase any Michelin assets or
         contracts in countries where the applicable NPV would not be
         calculated on the basis of a satisfactory discount rate as determined
         in the Acquirer's sole discretion. Taxes and costs directly
         associated with that transfer are for the account of the Acquirer.
         Assets funded after 31 August 2002 will be purchased at acquisition
         cost plus funding costs, minus corresponding rentals received up to
         their transfer.

4.11     Modification of the Schedules

         The Seller will be authorized to modify (in connection with minor
         changes) the Schedules to this Agreement on the Completion Date with
         the prior consent of the Acquirer which shall not be unreasonably
         withheld and provided that such changes are notified to the Acquirer
         at least five Business Days prior to Completion Date.

4.12     Governmental Approvals

         Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the Acquirer shall
         apply its best efforts to obtain as soon as possible all the European
         Governmental Approvals required prior to Completion and shall handle
         all necessary filings and formalities related thereto.

         other Party's notification, the other Party shall be entitled to (i)
         request full performance (execution forcee) of the obligations of the

         perform its obligations under this Agreement after the one month
         period referred to above, the other Party shall simultaneously

         obligations arising under this Agreement solely to an entity which is
         for the time being a member of the same group of companies as the
         Acquirer; provided, however that the Acquirer shall not be relieved
         of its obligations so assigned. None of the other Parties shall
         assign or transfer, or purport to assign or transfer, any of their
         rights or obligations arising under this Agreement without the prior
         written consent of the Acquirer, provided, however, that without such
         consent, such other Parties shall have the right to assign all or any
         part of their rights and obligations arising under this Agreement to
         an entity of their group but shall nevertheless not be relieved of
         their obligations hereunder.

13.3     Without prejudice to Clause 13.2, this Agreement and all the
         provisions hereof shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the
         Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

13.4     The Parties shall each pay their own costs, charges and expenses in
         relation to the negotiation, preparation, execution and
         implementation of this Agreement and the Seller covenants and agrees
         that it will shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by the Company
         or the Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated
         hereunder, including, without limitation, filing fees and fees and
         expenses of attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, lenders or
         brokers, unless such fees have been provided for in the net equity of
         the Company. It is understood that the Acquirer's counsel shall be
         responsible for preparing and submitting any filing with the DGCCRF
         and that the Acquirer shall be responsible for such fees.

13.5     This Agreement (together with all documents executed at Completion)
         constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the
         parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and
         supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, undertakings or
         statements regarding such subject matter.

13.6     This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and
         all respects, but only by a written instrument signed by all of the
         parties hereto expressly stating that such instrument is intended to
         amend, modify or supplement this Agreement.

13.7     If part of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the
         Parties shall remain bound to the remaining part. The relevant
         Parties shall in that event replace the invalid on non-binding part
         by provisions which are valid and binding and the effect of which,
         given the contents and purpose of this agreement, is to the greatest
         extent possible similar to the invalid or non-binding part.

13.8     No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or
         remedy in connection with this Agreement by the Acquirer shall
         operate as a waiver or a forfeiture of that right or remedy. No
         single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under this
         agreement by the Acquirer shall preclude any other or further
         exercise of that right or remedy or the exercise of any other right
         or remedy. A waiver of any breach of this Agreement by the Acquirer
         shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach.
         Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, a release, waiver or
         compromise or other arrangement or indulgence which the Acquirer
         agrees to or effects in relation to one of the Parties other than the
         Acquirer under or in connection with this Agreement shall not affect
         the Acquirer's rights or remedies as regards any of the other
         Parties.

13.9     This Agreement may be entered into any number of counterparts and by
         each of the Parties on separate counterparts, but shall not be
         effective until each Party has executed at least one counterpart.
         Each counterpart, when executed, shall constitute an original, but
         all the counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
         instrument.

14.      Governing Law and Jurisdiction

14.1     Governing Law

         This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in all respects in
         accordance with French law.

14.2     Arbitration

         The Parties expressly agree that all disputes and claims arising from
         or in connection with this Agreement, including failure to comply,
         its termination or nullification, shall be finally settled under the
         Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce then in
         effect including its Article 10 governing multi-party arbitration, by
         three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules, which
         shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide any such disputes and
         claims.

         The award of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the
         parties.

         The expenses of the arbitral proceeding and the fees of the
         arbitrators shall be advanced equally by the parties. The arbitral
         award shall state which party shall ultimately bear the expenses and
         fees, or in what proportion such expenses and fees shall be borne by
         each of the parties.

         If a party fails to comply with the arbitral award, such party shall
         be liable for the payment of any resulting costs, including
         attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in a proceeding to
         enforce the award.

         The arbitration proceedings shall be held in the city of Paris. The
         arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.
