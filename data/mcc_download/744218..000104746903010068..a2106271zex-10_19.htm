<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6

<UL>
<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>f. Termination Benefits On or After Change in Control.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> In the event of termination of the Executive's employment with the Company pursuant to
Section&nbsp;6(c) or 6(d) above on or after a Change in Control, the Company shall pay to the Executive an aggregate amount equal to (a)&nbsp;three (3)&nbsp;times the "base amount" (as defined
in Section&nbsp;280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) applicable to the Executive, less (b)&nbsp;One Dollar ($1.00), payable in one lump sum in cash on the date
of such termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is the intention of the Executive and of the Company that no payments by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive under this Agreement and/or any other agreement or plan
pursuant to which the Executive is entitled to receive payments or benefits shall be non-deductible to the Company by reason of the operation of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code relating to
parachute payments. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any such agreement or plan, if by reason of the operation of said Section&nbsp;280G, any such payments
exceed the amount which can be deducted by the Company in the aggregate, such payments shall be reduced to the maximum amount which can be deducted by the Company. To the extent that payments
exceeding such maximum deductible amount have been made to or for the benefit of the Executive, such excess payments shall be refunded to the Company with interest thereon at the applicable Federal
Rate determined under Section&nbsp;1274(d) of the Code, compounded annually, or at such other rate as may be required in order that no such payments shall be non-deductible to the
Company by reason of the operation of said Section&nbsp;280G. To the extent that there is more than one method of reducing the payments to bring them within the limitations of said
Section&nbsp;280G, the Executive shall determine which method shall be followed, provided that if the Executive fails to make such determination within 45&nbsp;days after the Company has sent her
written notice of the need for such reduction, the Company may determine the method of such reduction in its sole discretion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any dispute between the Company and the Executive as to any of the amounts to be determined under this subsection (f), or the method of calculating such amounts, cannot be resolved by
the Company and the Executive, either the Company or the Executive after giving three days' written notice to the other, may refer the dispute to a partner in the Boston office of a firm of
independent certified public accountants selected jointly by the Company and the Executive. The determination of such partner as to the amount to be determined under this subsection (f)&nbsp;and the
method of calculating
such amounts shall be final and binding on both the Company and the Executive. The Company shall bear the costs of any such determination." </FONT></P>
