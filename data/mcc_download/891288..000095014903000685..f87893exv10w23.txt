     performance, each January 1, beginning in 2001.

     as of the closing price on your first day of employment. Your options will
     vest monthly over a forty-eight month period with vesting beginning in
     month seven at which point you will be vested in 6/48ths of your options
     with another 1/8th being vested each month thereafter.

-    You will participate in the Company's benefits, which are appropriate for
     individuals on a Vice President level. This includes medical, dental, life
     insurance, disability, 401-K plan and a company stock purchase plan.

-    You currently have commission due from your current employer. They
     will not pay commission if you leave the company prematurely. To
     compensate for this we will pay a one-time bonus of $20,000 when you
     become employed by Questcor.

-    We will provide you with six months severance should your employment
     be terminated. If the Company ever merges or is acquired and a severance
     plan is put in place providing for severance for a period of time different
     than six months, you will receive severance for the greater period of time.

Ken, I believe you can make significant contributions to the growth and
development of Questcor. I look forward to a mutually beneficial working
relationship.


Sincerely,                                  Accepted by,
