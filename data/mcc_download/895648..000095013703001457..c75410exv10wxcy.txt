herein shall have the definitions assigned to such terms in the Second Restated
Partnership Agreement.

         2. ISSUANCE AND SALE OF ADDITIONAL SERIES A PREFERRED UNITS. The
Partnership hereby issues and sells to the General Partner an additional 45,000
Series A Preferred Units in exchange for the capital contribution in the amount
of the Overallotment Proceeds being made by the General Partner concurrently
herewith. The Partnership shall bear all expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Depositary Shares, including
without limitation the issuance and sale of the Overallotment Shares.

         3. TRANSFERS TO FOREIGN OWNERS. The last two sentences of Section 8.4
of the Second Restated Partnership Agreement are hereby deleted and the
following is hereby inserted in lieu thereof:

         "Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no
         Limited Partner admitted to the Partnership after the date hereof may
         sell, assign or otherwise transfer its Units or other interest in the
         Partnership or any portion thereof (and no interest in such Limited
         Partner or any Person that directly or indirectly owns an interest in
         such Limited Partner may be transferred) to any Foreign Owner and (b)
         no other Limited Partner may sell, assign or otherwise transfer its
         Units or other interest in the Partnership or any portion thereof (and
         no interest in such Limited Partner or any Person that directly or
         indirectly owns an interest in such Limited Partner may be transferred)
         to any Foreign Owner without providing written notice of the same to
         the General Partner. Any such written notice shall be received by the
         General Partner at least thirty days prior to any such sale, assignment
         or other transfer. Any sale, assignment or other transfer of Units or
         other interests in the Partnership made in violation of this Agreement
         (including without limitation any sale, assignment or other transfer of
         Units made without giving the notice described in the immediately
         preceding sentence) shall be null and void ab initio."

         4. NEW EXHIBIT A. Exhibit A to the Second Restated Partnership
Agreement is hereby deleted and Exhibit A in the form attached hereto is hereby
inserted in lieu thereof.

         5. OTHER PROVISIONS UNAFFECTED. Except as expressly provided herein,
the Second Restated Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
