Commitment. Upon any such assignment by Agent to any other Lender of a portion of an Advance pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.5, Agent represents and warrants to such other Lender that Agent is the
legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Advance, the Loan Documents, the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Advance available, such Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender. If such Lender shall have
made such amount available to Agent, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances made by Agent shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agent will provide notice to  </B></FONT></DD></DL>
