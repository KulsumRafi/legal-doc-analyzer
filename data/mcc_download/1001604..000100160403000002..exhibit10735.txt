Health  Care  Permits.
---------------------
Each Property Operator now has, and has no reason to believe it will not be able
to  maintain in effect, all Health Care Permits necessary for the lawful conduct
of  its  business  or  operations  wherever  now  conducted and as planned to be
conducted,  with respect to the operation of the Facility or Facilities operated
by  such  Property Operator pursuant to all applicable laws, of all Governmental
Authorities having  jurisdiction over such Property Operator or over any part of
its  operations  related to the Facilities.  All such Health Care Permits are in
full  force  and  effect  and  have  not  been  amended  or  otherwise modified,
rescinded,  revoked  or  assigned.  No  Property  Operator  is in default in any
material  respect  under,  or  in violation in any material respect of, any such
Health  Care  Permit,  and  to  the  best  knowledge  of  Borrower, no event has
occurred, and no condition exists, which, with the giving of notice, the passage
of  time, or both, could constitute a default thereunder or a violation thereof,
which  default  or  violation  would  (with the passage of time, notice or both)
result  in  the loss of any Health Care Permit which is necessary to operate any
Facility.  Neither  Borrower,  any  Property  Owner or any Property Operator has
received  any  notice  of any violation of applicable laws which could (with the
passage  of  time,  notice  or both) cause any of such Health Care Permits to be
modified, rescinded or revoked.  No condition exists or event has occurred which
in  itself  or  with  the  giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, could
result  in  the suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or non-renewal of
any  such Health Care Permit, and to the best knowledge of Borrower, there is no
claim  challenging  the  validity  of  any  such  Health  Care  Permit.  The
continuation, validity and effectiveness of all such Health Care Permits are not
reasonably  expected  to  be  in  any way adversely affected by the transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  any  of  the other Transaction Documents.
All  Facilities  are  entitled to participate in, and receive payment under, the
appropriate  Medicare,  Medicaid  and  related  reimbursement  programs, and any
similar  state  or  local  government-sponsored  program, to the extent that any
Property Operator has decided to participate in any such program, and to receive
reimbursement  from  private  and  commercial  payers  and  health  maintenance
organizations  to  the  extent  applicable  thereto.

Environmental  Laws.
-------------------
Conduct  its  business  in  compliance  in  all  material  respects  with  all
Environmental Laws applicable to it, including those relating to the generation,
handling, use, storage, and disposal of any Hazardous Substance; take prompt and
appropriate  action to respond to any material non-compliance with Environmental
Laws  and  shall  regularly  report  to  Lender  on  such  response.
Without  limiting  the  generality  of the foregoing, submit to Lender annually,
commencing  on  the  first  Anniversary  Date,  and  on  each  Anniversary  Date
thereafter, an update of the status of each material environmental compliance or
material  liability  issue, if any; provided that with respect to Emeritus, only
as such issues relate to the Facilities.  Lender may request copies of technical
reports  prepared  by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and its communications
with  any  Governmental  Authority  to  determine whether Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries  is proceeding reasonably to correct, cure or contest in good faith
any  alleged  material  non-compliance  or  material  environmental  liability.
Borrower  shall,  at  Lender's  request and at Borrower's expense, (i) retain an
independent  environmental  engineer  acceptable to Lender to evaluate the site,
including  tests  if  appropriate,  where the material non-compliance or alleged
material  non-compliance  with  Environmental  Laws has occurred and prepare and
deliver  to  Lender  a  report  setting  forth the results of such evaluation, a
proposed  plan  for  responding to any environmental problems described therein,
and  an estimate of the costs thereof, and (ii) provide to Lender a supplemental
report of such engineer whenever the scope of the environmental problems, or the
response  thereto or the estimated costs thereof, shall increase in any material
respect.
Lender  and  its  representatives  will have the right at any reasonable time to
enter and visit the Real Property related to the Facilities owned or operated by
Borrower,  any  Property  Operator  or  any Subsidiary of Borrower and any other
place  where  any  property  of  any  Loan  Party is located for the purposes of
observing  such  Real  Property and, if Lender reasonably believes Borrower, any
Property  Operator  or any Subsidiary of Borrower is not in compliance with this
Section  5.3(j), taking and removing soil or groundwater samples, and conducting
 --------------
tests  on  any  part  of  the  Real  Property related to the Facilities owned or
operated  by  Borrower,  any  Property  Operator  or any Subsidiary of Borrower.
Lender  is  under no duty, however, to visit or observe such Real Property or to
conduct  tests,  and  any such acts by Lender will be solely for the purposes of
protecting  Lender's  Liens and preserving Lender's rights under the Transaction
Documents.  No  site  visit,  observation  or testing by Lender will result in a
waiver  of  any default or impose any liability on Lender.  In no event will any
site  visit, observation or testing by Lender be a representation that hazardous
substances  are  or  are  not present in, on or under the Real Property, or that
there  has  been  or  will  be  compliance  with any Environmental Law.  Neither
Borrower,  any Property Operator nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other party
is entitled to rely on any site visit, observation or testing by Lender.  Lender
owes  no  duty  of care to protect Borrower, any Property Operator or any of its
Subsidiaries  or  any  other  party against, or to inform Borrower, any Property
Operator  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  or  any  other party of, any hazardous
substances  or  any other adverse condition affecting the Real Property owned or
operated  by  Borrower,  any  Property  Operator  or any Subsidiary of Borrower.
Lender  may  in  its discretion disclose to Borrower or to any other party if so
required  by  law  any  report or findings made as a result of, or in connection
with,  any  site  visit, observation or testing by Lender.  Borrower understands
and  agrees that Lender makes no warranty or representation to any Loan Party or
any other party regarding the truth, accuracy or completeness of any such report
or  findings that may be disclosed.  Borrower also understands that depending on
the results of any site visit, observation or testing by Lender and disclosed to
Borrower,  Borrower,  a Property Operator or a Subsidiary of Borrower may have a
legal  obligation  to  notify one or more environmental agencies of the results,
that  such  reporting requirements are site-specific, and are to be evaluated by
Borrower,  the Property Operators or its Subsidiaries of Borrower without advice
or  assistance  from  Lender.  In  each  instance,  Lender  will  give  Borrower
reasonable  notice  before  entering  the  Real  Property  owned  or operated by
Borrower, any Property Operator or any Subsidiary of Borrower or any other place
Lender  is  permitted  to  enter  under  this  Section 5.3(j).  Lender will make
                                               --------------
reasonable efforts to avoid interfering with the use of the Real Property or any
other  property  in  exercising  any  rights  provided  hereunder.

-------------------------------------
     .  Take  all  action reasonably necessary (i) to maintain in full force and
effect  all  Health  Care Permits reasonably necessary for the lawful conduct of
its business or operations wherever now conducted and as planned to be conducted

applicable  laws,  of  all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over any
such  Loan Party or over any part of its operations; and (ii) to ensure that all
of the Facilities owned, leased, managed or operated by any Property Operator or
any  Subsidiary  of Borrower are entitled to participate in, and receive payment
under,  the  appropriate  Medicare, Medicaid and related reimbursement programs,
and  any similar state or local government-sponsored program, to the extent that
such  Property  Operator  or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has decided to
participate  in  any such program, and to receive reimbursement from private and
commercial  payers and health maintenance organizations to the extent applicable
thereto,  except  (in  each  case)  where  a  failure  to do so could not have a
Material  Adverse  Effect.
Compliance  With  ERISA.
-----------------------
maintain  each  Plan  in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions  of  ERISA,  the  Code  and  other  federal  or  state  law;
cause  each Plan which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to maintain
such  qualification;
make  all required contributions to any Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code;

not  engage in a transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA.

institution  acceptable  to  Lender (the "Depository Bank") an operating account
                                          ---------------
(the  "Operating  Account").  The  Operating  Account  shall  be  in the name of
       ------------------
Borrower,  but shall be subject to a control agreement permitting Lender, at its
election  if  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred and is continuing, to assume
exclusive  control  over  the  Operating  Account.
All  rents, issues and profits received by any Property Owner (other than rents,
issues  and  profits  required  to  be  deposited  with  the holder of the First
Mortgage  Loan  Documents  with  respect to the Facility of such Property Owner)
shall  be deposited into the Operating Account.  In addition, all other payments
to which any Property Owner is entitled pursuant to the Master Lease, including,
insurance  or  condemnation  proceeds,  proceeds  of  any  put  payment required
pursuant  to  the  Master  Lease,  shall  also  be  deposited into the Operating
Account.
So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or will occur upon
giving effect to the application described below, funds in the Operating Account
may  be  applied  by  Borrower  to  make additional investments in the Permitted
Subsidiaries  or  for  general  corporate  purposes  of  Borrower; provided that
Borrower  may  make  dividend payments, loans or other distributions to Emeritus
only  on  a  Distribution  Date  and  only if such payments or distributions are
permitted  pursuant  to  this  Loan  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan Documents.
Lender  and Borrower acknowledge that Borrower, and not Lender, shall be treated
as  the  owner of the funds in the Operating Account for tax purposes, except to
the  extent  and  at  such  time  that  Lender actually withdraws funds from the
Operating Account in accordance with this Section 5.3(m) and the Reserve Account
                                          --------------
Security  Agreement.
Reserve  Accounts.
-----------------
On  or prior to the Closing Date Borrower shall establish at the Depository Bank
the  following  reserve  accounts  (collectively,  the  "Reserve  Accounts," and
                                                         -----------------

                                                  ------------------------------
Account")  to  be  used in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3(n)(ii);
  -----                                                      ------------------

                                       ----------------------------
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  5.3(n)(iii);
                                           ---------------------

be  used  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  5.3(n)(iv).
                                                     -------------------
The  Sinking Fund Reserve Account shall be in the name of Borrower, but Borrower
hereby  acknowledges  and  agrees,  that  Lender,  or  at  Lender's  election, a
servicing  agent  for Lender, shall have exclusive control over the Sinking Fund
Reserve  Account,  but the Sinking Fund Reserve Account shall be subject to, and
Lender  shall have only the rights provided in, the provisions of this Agreement
and  the  other  Loan Documents, including Section 5.3(n)(iii), (iv) and (v) and
                                           -------------------  ----     ---
the  provisions  of  the  Reserve  Account  Security  Agreement.  The Repair and
Replacement Reserve Account and the Mortgage Payment Reserve Account shall be in
the  name  of  Borrower,  but shall be subject to a control agreement permitting
Lender, at its election if an Event of Default has occurred, to assume exclusive
control over the Repair and Replacement Reserve Account and the Mortgage Payment
Reserve Account, but the Repair and Replacement Reserve Account and the Mortgage
Payment Reserve Account shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement and
the  other Loan Documents.  Until Lender assumes exclusive control, Borrower may
issue  instructions  with  respect  to  the disbursement and use of funds in the
Repair and Replacement Reserve Account and the Mortgage Payment Reserve Account,
provided  that  such  instructions are in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents.
On  each  Distribution  Date,  Borrower shall make a deposit into the Repair and
Replacement  Reserve  Account  for  the  Facilities in an amount equal to (A)(I)
$20.83  times  (II) the number of units in the Facilities on the last day of the
calendar  month  commencing  two calendar months prior to such Distribution Date
times  (III) the number of calendar months in the then current Test Period minus
(B)  the  sum  of  (I)  the  aggregate  amount  spent on repair, replacement and
renovation  of  the Facilities (but specifically excluding all Capital Additions
and  day-to-day  maintenance  with  respect  to the Facilities) (the "Repair and
                                                                      ----------
Replacement  Expenditures")  made  at  the Facilities during the applicable Test
    ---------------------
Period  plus  (II)  the  difference, if positive, between (x) the sum of (A) the
amount  of  all  deposits  made during the applicable Test Period into a reserve
account  to  be  used  for  Repair  and Replacement Expenditures pursuant to the
provisions  of  the First Mortgage Loan Documents for the Facilities and (B) the
amount  of  deposits  made during the applicable Test Period into the Repair and
Replacement Reserve Account and (y) the Repair and Replacement Expenditures made
during  the  applicable  Test Period.  So long as no Default or Event of Default
has  occurred and is continuing, Borrower may withdraw funds from the Repair and
Replacement  Reserve  to pay Repair and Replacement Expenditures, provided that,
if  Lender  so  requests,  Borrower shall deliver to Lender the following to the
extent  reasonably  applicable:  (w)  copies of paid invoices, receipts or other
evidence  satisfactory  to  Lender, verifying the cost and payment of the Repair
and  Replacement  Expenditures;  (x) copies of affidavits, lien waivers or other
evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to  Lender  showing  that  all  materialmen,
laborers,  subcontractors  and  any  other  parties  who  might  or  could claim

labor  to  the  applicable Facility have been paid all amounts due for labor and
materials  furnished  to  such  Facility; (y) a certification from an inspecting
architect,  engineer  or  other  consultant  acceptable  to  Lender  (the  "Work
                                                                            ----

verifying  the  completion of the Repair and Replacement Expenditures; and (z) a
copy  of  a  new  (or  amended)  certificate of occupancy for the portion of the
Facility  covered  by  such Repair and Replacement Expenditures, if said new (or
amended)  certificate  of  occupancy  is  required  by  law,  or a certification
acceptable  to Lender by the Work Inspector that no new (or amended) certificate
of  occupancy  is required.  Lender may, at Borrower's expense, make or cause to
be  made  an  annual  inspection  at  each  Facility  to  determine the need, as
determined  by  Lender  in  its  judgment,  for  further  Repair and Replacement
Expenditures at such Facility (or at such other times as Lender shall elect if a
Default  or  Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in an emergency or
in  connection with inspecting the Repair and Replacement Expenditures).  In the
event  that  such  inspection  reveals  that  further  Repair  and  Replacement
Expenditures on any Facility are required in order to maintain the Facilities in
compliance  with  the Master Lease, Lender shall provide Borrower with a written
description  of  the  required  Repair and Replacement Expenditures and Borrower
shall  complete,  or cause the applicable Property Owner or Property Operator to
complete, such Repair and Replacement Expenditures to the satisfaction of Lender
within  90 days after the receipt of such description from Lender, or such later
date  as  may  be  approved  by  Lender.
On  each  Distribution  Date that is in the last month of any fiscal quarter, if

principal  amount of the First Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the calendar
month  ending  immediately prior to such Distribution Date minus (II) the sum of
(w)  the  amount  of  all  deposits  in reserve accounts to be used for, or used
solely to support, debt service pursuant to the provisions of the First Mortgage
Loan Documents for the Facilities; (x) the amount on deposit in the Sinking Fund
Reserve  Account  as  of  the last day of such calendar month; (y) the scheduled
principal payments for the First Mortgage Loans for the period from the last day
of  such  calendar  month  through the end of the fiscal quarter containing such
Distribution  Date;  and (z) the stated amount of any Permitted Letter of Credit
outstanding  with  respect  to the Sinking Fund Reserve Account, is greater than
(B)  the  balance (the "Required Mortgage Loan Balance") required as of the last
                        ------------------------------
day  of  the  calendar  quarter  containing  such  Distribution Date pursuant to
Section 5.1(a), then Borrower shall make a deposit into the Sinking Fund Reserve
      --------
Account  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  cause  the  Net  Mortgage  Loan Balance
calculated as of such Distribution Date to be less than or equal to the Required
Mortgage  Loan  Balance in each case, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter.
So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, on any
Distribution  Date  that is in the last month of any fiscal quarter on which the
sum  of  (w)  the  amount of all deposits in reserve accounts to be used for, or
used  to  solely  support,  debt service pursuant to the provisions of the First
Mortgage  Loan  Documents  for  the Facilities; (x) the amount on deposit in the
Sinking  Fund  Reserve Account and (z) the stated amount of any Permitted Letter
of  Credit  outstanding  with respect to the Sinking Fund Reserve Account, is in
excess  of  (such  excess,  the  "Mortgage  Loan Balance Excess") the difference
                                  -----------------------------
between (i) the Required Mortgage Loan Balance as of the last day of such fiscal
quarter  minus  (ii)  the  Net  Mortgage  Loan  Balance  calculated  as  of such
Distribution  Date,  then  Lender  shall,  on the written request from Borrower,
release  funds from the Sinking Fund Reserve Account or reduce the stated amount
of  the  Permitted  Letter  of  Credit  issued  with respect to the Sinking Fund
Reserve  Account in an amount equal to the Mortgage Loan Balance Excess for such
Distribution  Date.
On  each  Distribution  Date,  Borrower  shall deposit into the Mortgage Payment
Reserve  Account  an amount equal to the difference, if positive between (i) the
sum of the required principal and interest payments for each First Mortgage Loan
that  has  a  required payment prior to the next subsequent Master Lease Payment
Date  minus  (ii)  the  sum,  for  all  First  Mortgage Loans that have required
payments  prior  to  the  next  subsequent Master Lease Payment Date, of (x) the
amount  held  by  the  holders  of  such First Mortgage Loans for the payment of
principal  and  interest  with  respect  to such First Mortgage Loan and (y) the
amount  held  by  the  Property Owners for the payment of principal and interest
with  respect  to  such  First  Mortgage Loans.  Amounts in the Mortgage Payment
Reserve Account may only be used to make required payments on the First Mortgage
Loans  on  the  date  such  payments  are  due.
None  of  the  Reserve  Accounts  shall, unless otherwise explicitly required by
applicable  law,  be  or be deemed to be escrow or trust funds, but, at Lender's
option  and  in Lender's discretion, may either be held in a separate account or
be  commingled with the other Reserve Accounts.  The Reserve Accounts are solely
for  the  protection  of  Lender  and  entail no responsibility on Lender's part
beyond  the  payment  of  the respective items for which they are held following
receipt  of  bills, invoices or statements therefor in accordance with the terms
hereof and beyond the allowing of due credit for the sums actually received.  If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender may, but shall not be
obligated,  to apply at any time the balance then remaining in any or all of the
Reserve  Accounts  against  the  Obligations  in  whatever  order  Lender  shall
subjectively  determine.  No  such  application  of  any  or  all of the Reserve
Accounts shall be deemed to cure any Event of Default.  Upon full payment of the
Obligations  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the Loan Documents or at such
earlier  time  as  Lender  may  elect,  the balance of any or all of the Reserve
Accounts  then  in  Lender's control shall be paid over to Borrower and no other
party  shall  have  any right or claim thereto.  Lender and Borrower acknowledge
that Borrower, and not Lender, shall be treated as the owner of the funds in the
Reserve  Accounts  for  tax purposes, except to the extent and at such time that
Lender  actually  withdraws funds from a Reserve Account in accordance with this
Section  5.3(n)  and  the  Reserve  Account  Security  Agreement.
 --------------
On  any  Distribution Date so long as no Event of Default has occurred, Borrower
may  substitute  a  Permitted  Letter  of  Credit  for  any  cash required to be
maintained  in  a  Reserve  Account,  so  long  as  after  giving effect to such
substitution  the  stated amount of such Permitted Letter of Credit plus amounts
on deposit in the Reserve Account with respect to which such Permitted Letter of

status  of  Lender  as  a  REIT.
(c)     Notwithstanding  anything  to  the contrary herein, while Borrower shall
not  be  required  independently  to  determine  whether  any  transaction  or
arrangement  would  adversely  affect  Lender's  ability to qualify as a REIT or
would result in a Property Owner or ESC-Land holding any assets other than "real
estate  assets"  as  defined  in  Section  856(c)(5)(B)  of  the Code ("Non-REIT
                                                                        --------

Owner  or  ESC-Land  holding  Non-REIT Assets or generating Non-REIT Income, the
Borrower  or  any Subsidiary, as applicable, shall take such actions (or refrain
from  taking such actions) as are required to protect Lender's REIT status or to
avoid  a  Property  Owner's or ESC-Land's receipt of such Non-REIT Income and/or
its  ownership  of  such  Non-REIT  Assets  (as  the  case  may  be).
