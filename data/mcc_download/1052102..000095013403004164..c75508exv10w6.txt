                                    not vary materially from the estimates. If

                                    faith will endeavor to agree on and
                                    substitute the actual amount of such
                                    Liability (provided that the actual amount

                                    Ordinary Course and is not materially
                                    different than the estimates) for the
                                    estimated amount reflected on the January

                                    amount of such Liability instead of the
                                    estimated amount;

                           (iii)    Any executory Liability to the Seller's
                                    customers incurred by the Seller in the

                                    SCHEDULE 2.1(b)(VI) attached hereto (other

                  (c)      A contingent amount ("CONTINGENT AMOUNT"), if any,
                           payable to the Seller, within 45 days of the Buyer's
                           receipt of an audited financial statement for the
                           Business for its fiscal year ending December 31,
                           2005, equal to (i) eighty-nine and three-tenths
                           percent (89.3%) of twenty percent (20%) of the
                           Business Equity Value of the Buyer as determined by
                           the Buyer's independent certified public accountants,
                           less (ii) those amounts specified or described in
                           Section 10.6 hereof and/or any other amounts properly
                           offset against the Contingent Amount in accordance
                           with this Agreement. "BUSINESS EQUITY VALUE" shall
                           mean an amount equal to the product of five (5) times
                           the weighted average Adjusted EBITDA of the Business
                           for its fiscal years ending December 31, 2003, 2004
                           and 2005, weighting 2003 Adjusted EBITDA by a factor
                           of one (1), weighting 2004 Adjusted EBITDA by a
                           factor of four (4), weighting the 2005 Adjusted
                           EBITDA by a factor of five (5), and dividing the
                           resulting sum by a factor of ten (10). "ADJUSTED
                           EBITDA" shall mean the separate earnings of the
                           Business as conducted by the Buyer computed before
                           interest, income taxes, depreciation and
                           amortization, as reflected on an income statement of
                           the Buyer, adjusted to: (i) eliminate the effect of
                           (A) extraordinary or non-recurring items of gain
                           (such as the gain or sale of disposed capital assets
                           or insurance proceeds) and (B) receipt of indemnity
                           payments, if any, received by the Buyer in connection
                           with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
                           hereby, and (ii) reflect reasonable charges (as
                           determined by such independent certified public
                           accountants) for services (e.g., corporate services
                           including, but not limited to, accounting, sales and
                           marketing, general management/administrative, and

                           Inc. to the Buyer. The Buyer shall cause its
                           independent certified public accountants to provide
                           the Seller, reasonably promptly after the end of each
                           calendar year and the

                           completion of the financial statements for such year,
                           commencing with calendar year 2002, with such
                           accountant's calculation of such year's Adjusted
                           EBITDA. The Seller shall have a period of 30 days
                           after receipt thereof to confirm such calculation as
                           being made correctly in accordance with this Section
                           2.1(c) or issue an objection thereto. If the Seller
                           fails to object to such calculation within such
                           30-day period, the calculation shall be conclusive
                           and final. If the Seller objects within such 30-day
                           period, the Seller shall specify its objection in
                           writing, detailing the portion(s) of such calculation
                           which the Seller believes has not been made in
                           accordance with this Section 2.1(c), and supplying
                           such information as the Seller possesses to support
                           its objection. If, within 20 days after receipt of
                           such objection, the Buyer and Seller have not
                           resolved their differences, the parties shall submit
                           such differences (to the extent not reconciled during
                           such 20-day period) to arbitration pursuant to
                           Section 11.5 of this Agreement.

                           In the event that the Buyer disposes of the Business
                           prior to December 31, 2005 (which the Buyer covenants
                           that it shall not do, unless (i) the Buyer pays any
                           Contingent Amount due the Seller in accordance
                           herewith simultaneously with the closing of such
                           disposition, or (ii) if such Contingent Amount is not
                           so simultaneously paid, the acquiror thereof agrees
                           expressly to assume the obligation herein contained
                           to pay the Contingent Amount in accordance with its
                           terms, or (iii) the Seller expressly agrees in
                           writing to such disposition), Adjusted EBITDA will be
                           determined by utilizing the weighted average Adjusted
                           EBITDA of the Business for the three (3) completed
                           fiscal years of the Buyer immediately preceding the
                           year of such disposition, weighting such years'
                           Adjusted EBITDA in a similar manner as set forth
                           above, and the contingent Amount, as so determined,
                           will be paid by the Buyer simultaneously with the
                           closing of such disposition. If the Business is
                           disposed of at a time such that the Buyer has not
                           completed three (3) fiscal years' conduct of the
                           Business, weighted average Adjusted EBITDA shall be
                           based upon the actual number of completed fiscal
                           years which the Buyer has conducted the Business
                           preceding the disposition. In such event: if the
                           number of such completed fiscal years is two (2), the
                           Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year immediately
                           preceding the year of the Business's disposition
                           shall be weighted by a factor of six (6) and the next
                           preceding fiscal year's Adjusted EBITDA shall be
                           weighted by a factor of four (4), and the resulting
                           sum shall be divided by a factor of ten (10); if the
                           number of such completed fiscal years is one (1), the
                           Business Value will be determined based upon the
                           product of five (5) times such year's Adjusted EBITDA
                           and no weighting shall be required.

         2.2      Mateski Properties Purchase Price. The full consideration
payable to Mateski Properties for the Mateski Properties Purchased Assets (the
"MATESKI PROPERTIES PURCHASE PRICE") shall be the Buyer's assumption at the
Closing of, and agreement to discharge, the following (and only the following)
obligations of Mateski Properties (the "ASSUMED MATESKI PROPERTIES

                           balance sheet may contain some estimates, but that
                           the actual amounts will not vary materially from the
                           estimates. If Mateski Properties identifies any of
                           the Liabilities described in Section 2.2(a) as
                           estimated due only to the absence of final
                           information as of the date of this Agreement, the

                           endeavor to agree on and substitute the actual amount
                           of such Liability (provided that the actual amount of
                           such Liability was incurred in the Ordinary Course
                           and is not materially different than the estimates)
                           for the estimated amount reflected on the January 31
                           balance sheet, and the Buyer shall then assume such

                           estimated amount; and

                  (b)      Denials of Coverage. Neither the Seller nor Mateski
Properties has been refused any insurance with respect to the Business, Purchase
Assets or Mateski Properties Purchased Assets, nor has the dollar amount of any
coverage that has been previously in effect or requested by Seller or Mateski

Section, Hired Employees shall cease to be covered by the Seller's Welfare Plans
(as hereinafter defined). The Seller shall be responsible for all of the
following claims incurred by Hired Employees under the Seller's Welfare Plans:
(i) under any medical, dental or health plans for any treatment or service
actually rendered prior to the Closing Date (but not rendered thereafter)
regardless of whether the service or treatment is part of an ongoing course of
treatment that commenced prior to the Closing Date; (ii) under any life
insurance plans or contracts with respect to deaths occurring prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) for any payments or benefits incurred prior to the
Closing Date under any other Seller's Welfare Plan, except that the extent to
which any such claims are payable shall be determined by the provisions of the
applicable Seller's Welfare Plan. The Seller or Mateski Properties shall be
responsible for providing all employees of the Seller or Mateski Properties
whose employment is terminated and who are covered under a "group health plan"
(within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) maintained by the Seller
or Mateski Properties (the "SELLER'S GROUP HEALTH PLAN"), and the qualified
spouses and dependents of these employees, with continuation coverage under
the Seller's Group Health Plan to the extent required by the provisions of
COBRA, as amended, as currently set forth in Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, and the implementing regulations
promulgated or proposed under either of those laws. The Buyer shall have no
obligation to provide, nor any liability for, any benefits of any kind under

                                       35

<PAGE>

any of the Seller's Welfare Plans, including, but not limited to, any COBRA
benefits under any group health plan of the Seller or Mateski Properties. For
purposes of this Section, the "SELLER'S WELFARE PLANS" shall include each
"employee welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA)
and each other Benefit Plan that is not an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA.

                  (b)      The Seller's 401(k) Plan. The Seller maintains the
Systematic Refrigeration, Inc. Employee Savings & Retirement Plan (the "SELLER'S
401(k) PLAN"), a defined contribution profit-sharing plan with a cash or
deferred arrangement that is intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the Code. The Seller shall retain sponsorship of the Seller's 401(k)
Plan after the Closing Date and neither the Buyer nor any plan maintained by the
Buyer shall be entitled to any assets of the Seller's 401(k) Plan. The Buyer
shall not assume any responsibility or liability for the Seller's 401(k) Plan,
and the Seller and the Seller's 401(k) Plan shall remain solely and entirely
responsible for satisfying any and all obligations and liabilities arising under
the Seller's 401(k) Plan. The accrued benefits under the Seller's 401(k) Plan of
all Hired Employees shall become 100% vested and non-forfeitable as of the
Closing Date to the extent not already 100% vested and non-forfeitable and the
Seller shall cause the Seller's 401(k) Plan to be amended, if necessary, to
provide for such 100% vesting and nonforfeitability. The accrued benefits of the
Hired Employees under the Seller's 401(k) Plan shall be distributed to the Hired
Employees after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Seller's
401(k) Plan and the applicable provisions of the Code.

         6.21     Confidentiality; Noncompetition.

                  (a)      Confidential Information. The Seller, Mateski
Properties, Shareholders and Members acknowledge that they possess information
of a confidential nature relating, inter alia, to the operations, finances,
business relationships and trade secrets of the Business and agree that, for a
period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, other than as required in
the course of their employment with the Buyer, none of them directly or
indirectly shall use, publish, disclose or authorize anyone else to use, publish
or disclose, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, within the
geographical area in which such use, publication or disclosure could harm the
Business, any confidential information pertaining to the Business, including,
without limitation, any information relating to existing or potential business,
customers, suppliers, trade or industrial practices, finances, plans, costs,
processes, product formulae, technical or engineering data, or trade secrets;
provided, however, that the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders and Members
shall be prohibited from ever using, publishing, disclosing or authorizing
anyone else to use, publish or disclose, any confidential information which
constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. However, such restrictions
shall not apply to any information which is generally known to the public
through no fault of the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or Members or
which is required by Law to be disclosed (provided, however, that before any
such disclosure required to be made by Law, the disclosing Person shall inform
the Buyer thereof, and shall cooperate with the Buyer in obtaining a protective,
limiting or similar order restricting the scope or dissemination of such
disclosed information).

                  (b)      Noncompetition. For a five (5) year period following
the Closing Date, none of the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or
Members directly or indirectly (through Related Persons or otherwise) shall: (i)
engage, as an employee, officer, director, partner, consultant, owner (other
than a minority shareholder interest of not more than 1% of a company whose
equity interests are publicly traded on a nationally recognized stock exchange
or over-the-counter), financier or in any other capacity, or assist any other
person, firm or entity to engage in any activity (A) competitive to the Business
as such Business is conducted on the Closing Date or as planned by the Seller to
be conducted within one year of the Closing Date, in any

                                       36

<PAGE>

geographic area in which the Seller conducts the Business or promotes its
products and services or in any geographic area wherein the Seller has made
plans to enter within one year from the Closing Date; or (ii) solicit or accept
the competitive business of any person, firm or entity which is or was a
customer of the Business or of any prospective customer to whom the Seller made
any proposal, sales effort or solicitation since January 1, 1999, with respect
to products or services which compete with the Business.

                  (c)      Non-Solicitation. For a period of five (5) years
following the Closing Date, none of the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders
or Members shall directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, or assist another person,
firm or entity to solicit, any employee, supplier or other person having
business relations with the Business to terminate such employee's employment or
terminate or curtail such supplier's or other Person's relationship with the
Business; or (ii) hire, employ or retain, or solicit or assist another Person,
firm or entity to hire, employ or retain, any employee of the Business.

                  (d)      Referral. For a period of five (5) years following
the Closing Date, if the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or Members
receives any request or inquiry to provide the types of products and services of
the type provided by the Business, such Person will promptly refer such request
or inquiry to the Buyer. In no event shall the Seller, Mateski Properties,
Shareholders or Members disparage the Buyer or the Business's reputation.

                  (e)      Agreement on Fairness. The Seller, Mateski
Properties, Shareholders and Members acknowledge that, with respect to the
reasonableness of this noncompetition covenant: (i) in determining the
consideration paid to the Seller and Mateski Properties for the Purchased
Assets, Mateski Properties Purchased Assets and Business, the Buyer has valued
the Purchased Assets, Mateski Properties Purchased Assets and Business in
reliance upon the goodwill and earnings stream reasonably expected to be derived
therefrom and, further, upon the absence of activities by the Seller, Mateski
Properties, Shareholders and Members competitive to the Business and the absence
of disclosure by such Persons of confidential information, which reliance and
reasonable expectations would be unfairly frustrated if the Seller, Mateski
Properties, Shareholders or Members failed to comply with the restrictions
contained herein; (ii) the covenants contained in this Section 6.21 have been
specifically bargained between the parties in the context of the contemplated
transactions; (iii) the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders and Members
have obtained legal counsel to review this Agreement; (iv) the covenants made by
and duties imposed upon them hereby are fair, reasonable and minimally necessary
to protect the legitimate business interests and expectations of the Buyer, and
such covenants and duties will not place an undue burden upon the Shareholders
or Members in the event of the strict enforcement of the covenants contained
herein; and (v) the economic benefits of the contemplated transactions directly
and indirectly accruing to the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders and
Members constitute full, fair and adequate consideration to them in exchange for
their execution of and compliance with this Agreement.

                  (f)      Equitable Relief. The Seller, Mateski Properties,
Shareholders and Members acknowledge that any Breach of this Section 6.21 will
cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Buyer for which money damages
would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other rights or
remedies available at law, in equity or by statute, the Buyer shall in any such
event be entitled, without the necessity of posting bond or other assurance, to
obtain injunctive and other forms of equitable relief to prevent such Breach.

                                       37

<PAGE>

                  (g)      Joint and Several Obligations. The covenants and
representations of the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders and Members
contained in this Section 6.21 shall be their joint and several obligations.

                  (h)      Extension of Time Periods. In the event of a Breach
by the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or Members of any covenant set
forth in this Section 6.21, the duration of such covenant shall be extended by
the period of the duration of such Breach.

                  (i)      Severability; Blue-Pencil. Each of the covenants
contained herein is independent and divisible. If any arbitrator or court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any particular provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then such invalidity or unenforceability
shall have no effect on the other provisions hereof, which shall remain valid,
binding and enforceable and in full force and effect. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable due to an excessively broad
duration, activity or subject, such provision shall be construed by limiting or
reducing it to such duration or scope as will render the remaining provision, as
so construed, valid and enforceable.

         6.22     Termination of Lease. Mateski Properties and the Seller shall
have executed, and at the Closing delivered a counterpart thereof to the Buyer,
a termination of that certain Lease, dated April 1, 2000 by and between them,
effective as of the Closing, and on terms acceptable to the Buyer (including,
without limitation, a complete release by Mateski Properties in favor of the
Seller with respect to any and all obligations of the Seller thereunder, other
than the Seller's obligation to pay not more than $134,500 of any rent accrued
but unpaid through the Closing).

         6.23     Agreement to Subordinate. At Closing, the Seller shall execute
and deliver to the Buyer and Buyer's lender the Subordination Agreement
(Contingent Amount) in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT E ("SUBORDINATION
AGREEMENT"). In the event that, subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer or Zero
Zone, Inc. extends, amends (including, without limitation, any amendment
increasing the amount of the senior indebtedness), modifies, refinances or
replaces the senior debt described in the Subordination Agreement, whether in
whole or part and with the senior lender named in such Subordination Agreement
or with one or more different or other lenders, the Seller (together with any
Person to whom the Seller has transferred or assigned any rights to the
Contingent Amount), upon the request of the Buyer, shall execute any such other
or further subordination, intercreditor or similar agreement as may be requested
by the Buyer so as to subordinate the contingent Amount to the Buyer's or its
Related Persons' (including Zero Zone, Inc.'s) indebtedness to its or their
lenders, provided that no such subsequent subordination, intercreditor or
similar agreement shall impose subordination terms or conditions upon the Seller
as are materially more adverse to the interest of the Seller than those
contained in the Subordination Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                             COVENANTS OF THE BUYER

         The Buyer covenants and agrees with the Seller as follows:

         7.1      Certified Resolutions. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller a copy of the resolutions of the Buyer's Board of
Directors, authorizing and approving the execution of this Agreement and the
performance by the Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby, certified by
the secretary or the president of the Buyer.

                                       38

<PAGE>

         7.2      Employment Agreement. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
execute and deliver to Theodore A. Mateski the Employment Agreement.

         7.2      Fulfill Conditions. The Buyer shall use its best efforts to
cause to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing each of the conditions set
forth in Article IX hereof.

         7.4      The Buyer's Benefit Plans.

                  (a)      The Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall provide Hired Employees with coverage under a defined
contribution profit-sharing plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is
intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the
"BUYER'S 401(k) PLAN"). The Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall provide credit to Hired
Employees for all of their service with the Seller, solely for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting, to the same extent such service would
have been credited if the service had been performed for the Buyer. After the
Closing Date, Buyer shall permit Hired Employees who are entitled and who elect
to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" (as described in Section
402(f)(2)(A) of the Code) from the Seller's 401(k) Plan to direct that the
eligible rollover distribution be transferred to the Buyer's 401(k) Plan in
accordance with Section 402(c) of the Code and the Buyer shall cause the Buyer's
401(k) Plan to contain provisions permitting such transfers.

                  (b)      The Buyer's Welfare Plans. The Buyer shall not assume
or continue any of the Seller's Benefit Plans. Other than the Buyer's 401(k)
Plan described in the preceding subsection of this Section, the Buyer shall
provide Hired Employees, as of the Closing Date, with such employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements (the "BUYER'S WELFARE PLANS") as the
Buyer may determine. With respect to medical and other health-related benefits,
the Buyer shall provide each Hired Employee (and each such Hired Employee's
spouses and dependents) with immediate coverage as of the Closing Date under a
"group health plan" (within the meaning of Section 5001(b) of the Code)
maintained by the Buyer (the "BUYER'S GROUP HEALTH PLAN") that provides benefits
and includes terms and conditions as determined by the Buyer, except that the
Buyer shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions or restrictions with
respect to Hired Employees under the Buyer's Group Health Plan to the same
extent as coverage is provided under the Seller's Group Health Plan. Each Hired
Employee shall receive credit under the Buyer's Group Health Plan for all
amounts paid by each Hired Employee in calendar year 2002 under the Seller's
Group Health Plan for purposes of any applicable deductibles, co-payments or
out-of-pocket maximums for calendar year 2002. The Buyer shall be solely
responsible for providing Hired Employees with any continuation coverage (and
shall have sole liability in respect of any failure to provide such continuation
coverage) under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA resulting from any "qualifying event" occurring on or after the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall grant full credit to Hired Employees under the Buyer's
Welfare Plans that are not group health plans, for service with the Seller for
purposes of (i) satisfying any and all eligibility and participation
requirements under the Buyer's Welfare Plans and (ii) determining the amount and
duration of any benefits under the Buyer's Welfare Plans to the extent that
service or seniority is a consideration in calculating benefits but the Buyer
shall not be required to credit any service that would result in a duplication
of benefits. The Seller shall have no obligation to provide nor any liability
for any benefits of any kind to Hired Employees under any of the Buyer's Welfare
Plans, including but not limited to COBRA benefits under any group health plan
of Buyer.

                  (c)Employment Terms and Benefits after the Closing Date.
Nothing in this Section or Section 6.20 shall be construed to limit or restrict
the Buyer in any way with respect to (i) the Buyer's conduct of the Business
after the Closing Date; (ii) the Buyer's modification or change in

                                       39

<PAGE>

the terms of employment (including the termination of employment) of any Hired
Employee; and (iii) the Buyer's modification, amendment or termination of any
employee benefit plan maintained or contributed to by the Buyer, including but
not limited to any of the Buyer's Welfare Plans.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

or the performance of services, by the Seller prior to the Closing) or any
incident, occurrence, condition or claim existing, arising or accruing prior to
the Closing and relating to or arising from the operation or conduct of the
Business or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets or Mateski Properties
Purchased Assets, other than any Assumed Liability or Assumed Mateski Properties
Obligations or

                  (e)      Any of the matters set forth in Schedules 2.1(b)(vi),
item 8; 4.18, items 2, 4 and 5; and 4.21, item 1 of the DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE.

         10.2     Indemnification by Buyer. Notwithstanding the Closing, and
regardless of any investigation made by, or on behalf of, the Seller, Mateski
Properties or Members, or any information known to them, the Buyer, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Article X, shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Seller, Mateski Properties and Members harmless from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses or deficiencies including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses
reasonably incident to proceedings or investigations or the defense or
settlement of any claim or claims, incurred by the Seller due to or arising from
any of the following:

                  (a)      Representations or Warranties. The Breach of any
representation or warranty of the Buyer given in or pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (b)      Covenants. The Breach or default in the performance
by the Buyer of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements in or pursuant
to this Agreement;

                  (c)      Liabilities Expressly Assumed. Any Assumed Liability
or Assumed Mateski Properties Obligations; or

                  (d)      Post-Closing Operations. The operation or conduct of
the Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets or Mateski Properties
Purchased Assets after the Closing, or any incident, occurrence, condition or
claim first arising and accruing after the Closing and arising from

                                       43

<PAGE>

the operation of the Business or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets or
Mateski Properties Purchased Assets after the Closing, but in any case only if
the matter is not of a type for which the Seller, Mateski Properties and Members
are obligated to indemnify the Buyer under SECTION 10.1 hereof.

         10.3     Procedures for Making Claims. If and when a party (the
"INDEMNITEE") desires to assert a claim for Indemnifiable Damages against
another party or parties (collectively, the "INDEMNITOR") pursuant to the
provisions of this Article X, the Indemnitee shall deliver a Notice of Claim to
the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor shall object to such Notice of Claim, the
Indemnitor shall simultaneously deliver a Notice of Objection to the Indemnitee
within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnitee's delivery of the Notice of Claim.
If the Notice of Objection shall not have been so delivered within such fifteen
(15) day period, all Indemnitors shall be conclusively deemed to have
acknowledged the correctness of the claim or claims specified in the Notice of
Claim for the full amount thereof, and the Indemnifiable Damages set forth in
the Notice of Claim shall be promptly paid to the Indemnitee, on demand, in
cash. If the Indemnitor shall make timely objection to a claim or claims set
forth in any Notice of Claim, and if such claim or claims shall not have been
resolved or compromised within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of the
Notice of Objection, then such claims shall be settled by arbitration pursuant
to Section 11.5 hereof. The arbitrator shall promptly obtain such information
regarding the matter that the arbitrator deems necessary and shall decide the
matter and render a written award which shall be delivered to the Indemnitor and
Indemnitee. Any award shall be a conclusive determination of the matter and
shall be binding upon the Indemnitor and Indemnitee. If, by arbitration, it
shall be determined that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to any Indemnifiable
Damages by reason of its claim or claims, the Indemnifiable Damages so
determined shall be paid to the Indemnitee by the Indemnitor in the same manner
as if the Indemnitee had not delivered a Notice of Objection.

         10.4     Participation in Defense of Third Party Claims. If any third
Person shall assert any claim against an Indemnitee which, if successful, might
result in an obligation of the Indemnitor to pay Indemnifiable Damages and which
can be remedied to the sole satisfaction of the Indemnitee by the payment of
money damages without further adverse consequence to the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitor, at the sole expense of the Indemnitor, may assume the primary
defense thereof with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, but only
if and so long as: (i) the Indemnitor diligently pursues the defense of such
claim; and (ii) the Indemnitor acknowledges to the Indemnitee in writing that
the claim, if resolved or settled adversely to the Indemnitee, is one for which
the Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder; and (iii) the
Indemnitor reasonably demonstrates to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee
currently possesses sufficient cash and/or other liquid assets adequate to
defend and, if necessary, in the event that the claim is resolved or settled
adversely to the Indemnitor, satisfy the claim. If the Indemnitor fails or is
unable so to elect to assume the primary defense of any such claim, the
Indemnitee may (but need not) do so; in which event the Indemnitee may defend,
settle or compromise the claim, at the expense and cost of the Indemnitor, in
any such manner as the Indemnitee reasonably deems appropriate.

         10.5     Survival of Indemnification. An Indemnitor's obligation to pay
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of claims described in Sections 10.1(b),
10.1(c), 10.1(d), 10.2(b), 10.2(c) and 10.2(d) hereof shall survive the Closing
of this transaction indefinitely. The representations and warranties contained
in Articles IV and V hereof, and an Indemnitor's obligation to pay Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of Section 10.1(a) and 10.2(a) hereof, shall survive the
Closing Date, as follows:

                  (a)      Fraudulent Breach of Representations; Certain
Representations. In the case of a claim based upon the inaccuracy or Breach of a
representation or warranty which was made

                                       44

<PAGE>

fraudulently or with respect to any representation or warranty contained in
Sections 4.1 through and including 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.30 and 4.31 hereof,
indefinitely;

                  (b)      Taxes. In the case of a claim based upon the
inaccuracy or Breach of a representation or warranty pertaining to taxes, for a
period equal to the applicable statute of limitations; and

                  (c)      All Other Claims. In the case of all other claims
based upon the inaccuracy or Breach of representation or warranty, for a period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the date in 2006 that the Contingent
Amount, if any, becomes due as described in Section 2.1(c) hereof.

                  No claim for recovery of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of
Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.2(a) hereof may be asserted by an Indemnitee after
the expiration of the applicable time period described in the foregoing Sections
10.5(a)-(c); provided, however, that any claim first asserted by the giving of a
Notice of Claim within the applicable survival period shall neither be abated
nor barred.

         10.6     Offset. The Buyer shall be entitled (but not required) to
offset against any obligations now or hereafter owed by the Buyer to the Seller,
Mateski Properties, Shareholders or Members (including, without limitation, the
Contingent Amount which may become due and payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
hereof) the sum of all Indemnifiable Damages that the Buyer is entitled to
pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof. Any Indemnifiable Damages which the Buyer
elects to set-off against an obligation owed the Buyer shall be deemed "paid"
(for purposes of calculating the interest component of such Indemnifiable
Damages) not earlier than the date when the obligation against which the
Indemnifiable Damages are offset otherwise becomes fixed, due and payable to the
Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or Members. For example, if
Indemnifiable Damages are incurred by the Buyer on July 1, 2002 and the Buyer
then elects to set-off such Indemnifiable Damages against the Contingent Amount
due the Seller pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof, such Indemnifiable Damages
shall not be deemed paid (for purposes of computing the interest component
thereof) until that time in 2006 (or, in the event of a prior disposition of the
Business, such earlier time) when such Contingent Amount becomes fixed, due and
payable. No offset made by the Buyer pursuant to this Section shall constitute a
default under any of the Buyer's payment obligations or, even if it is
subsequently determined that no Indemnifiable Damages were due the Buyer, give
rise to any right of acceleration.

         10.7     Limitations on Indemnifiable Damages.

                  (a)      Minimum Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Buyer shall not be entitled to recover Indemnifiable Damages for any matter
described in Section 10.1(a) hereof (other than a claim under Section 10.1(a)
based upon a Breach of Sections 4.1 through and including 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.22,
4.30 and 4.31) unless and until the aggregate of all claims for Indemnifiable
Damages asserted pursuant to Section 10.1(a) hereof exceeds $25,000 (but, if
such claims exceed $25,000 in the aggregate, the Buyer shall be entitled to
recover from the first dollar). Furthermore, the Buyer shall not be entitled to
recover the first $5,000 of Indemnifiable Damages for the matters described in
Section 10.1(e) hereof.

                  (b)      Assignment of Uncollected Receivables. In the event
that Indemnifiable Damages are payable to the Buyer because all or a portion of
the Receivables are not collected by the Buyer as herein provided, the Buyer
shall assign (without recourse) such Receivables (to the

                                       45

<PAGE>

extent uncollected) to the Seller promptly after payment by the Indemnitors of
the Indemnifiable Damages becoming due as a result of such noncollection.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1     Further Assurances. Each party hereto from time to time
hereafter, and upon request, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such other
instruments as reasonably may be required to more effectively transfer and vest
in the Buyer the Purchased Assets and Mateski Properties Purchased Assets or to
otherwise carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         11.2     Benefit and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the parties hereto, their heirs, successors, assignees, and beneficiaries in
interest. No rights under this Agreement may be assigned nor any obligations
delegated, in whole or part, by the Seller, Mateski Properties, Shareholders or
Members, other than assignment of rights (in the case of the Shareholders or
Members, upon their death in accordance with their testamentary deposition or
the laws of intestacy or, in the case of the Seller or Mateski Properties, upon
their dissolution to their respective shareholders or members). The Buyer may
assign all or any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, in favor of any Person providing financing to the Buyer).

         11.3     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Minnesota
(regardless of such State's conflict of laws principles), and without reference
to any rules of construction regarding the party responsible for the drafting
hereof.

         11.4     Expenses. The Buyer shall pay all of its own expenses, fees or
costs incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, drafting and
performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholders and
Members (and not the Seller or Mateski Properties) shall pay all of the
expenses, fees and costs incurred by them, the Seller or Mateski Properties in
connection with the negotiation, drafting and performance of their, the Seller's
and Mateski Properties' obligations under this Agreement or the Settlement
Agreement or any other document executed in connection herewith or therewith
(including their legal accounting and other professional fees; costs of the
Commitment, the premiums for the title insurance policy and the Survey; transfer
taxes, and any costs incurred in connection with the procural of third Person
consents or Licenses), and none of such expenses, fees and costs shall have been
paid or be paid by or accrued as a liability of the Seller or Mateski
Properties.

         11.5     Arbitration. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any claim
regarding the scope or effect of this Section and any claim that this Section is
invalid or unenforceable), or the Breach hereof or thereof, shall be settled by
a single arbitrator in binding arbitration conducted in Madison, Wisconsin in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") (or such other arbitration service as the parties may agree
upon), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's decision shall be in
writing. In addition to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA and unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, the following rules shall apply:

                  (a)      Each party shall be entitled to discovery exclusively
                           by the following means: (i) requests for admission,
                           (ii) requests for production of documents, (iii) up

                                       46

<PAGE>

                           to 15 written interrogatories (with any subpart to be
                           counted as a separate interrogatory), and (iv)
                           depositions of no more than six individuals.

                  (b)      Unless the arbitrator finds that delay is reasonably
                           justified or as otherwise agreed to by the parties,
                           all discovery shall be completed, and the arbitration
                           hearing shall commence within five months after the
                           appointment of the arbitrator.

                  (c)      Unless the arbitrator finds that delay is reasonably
                           justified, the hearing will be completed, and an
                           award rendered within 30 days of commencement of the
                           hearing.

                  (d)      If the dispute submitted to arbitration arises from
                           disagreement concerning Adjusted EBITDA or the proper
                           calculation of the Contingent Amount pursuant to
                           Section 2.1(c) hereof, the arbitrator shall be a
                           partner at the Madison, Wisconsin office of a "Big
                           Five" firm of independent certified public
                           accountants having no then current relationship to
                           any of the Buyer, Seller, Mateski Properties,
                           Shareholders or Members.

The arbitrator's authority shall include the ability to render equitable types
of relief and, in such event, any aforesaid court may enter an Order enjoining
and/or compelling such actions or relief ordered or as found by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator also shall make a determination regarding which party's legal
position in any such controversy or claim is the more substantially correct (the
"Prevailing Party") and the arbitrator shall require the other party to pay the
legal and other professional fees and costs incurred by the Prevailing Party in
connection with such arbitration proceeding and any necessary court action.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties expressly agree that a court
of competent jurisdiction may enter a temporary restraining order or an order
enjoining a Breach of this Agreement pending a final award or further order by
the arbitrator. Such remedy, however, shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, and
shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the parties may be entitled.

         11.6     Notices. Any and all notices, demands, and communications
provided for herein or made hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be
deemed given to a party at the earlier of (i) when actually delivered to such

indicated for such party below (or to such other facsimile number for a party as
