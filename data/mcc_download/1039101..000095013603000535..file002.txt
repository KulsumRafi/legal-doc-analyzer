satisfaction of each of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 4
of this Amendment, Borrower and the Required Lenders hereby agree to amend the
Credit Agreement as follows:

          2.1     The fifth sentence in Section 4.12 of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

                  "As of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on
          which this representation is made or deemed made, the actuarial
          present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under the Single
          Employer Plans taken as a whole did not exceed the fair market value
          of the assets available for benefits under such Plans by an amount
          which would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
          Effect (with all valuations determined in accordance with Statement of
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 87)."

          2.2     Section 6.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:


         "6.10    Additional Collateral.

                  (a)  With respect to any Capital Stock of any newly created or
          acquired Subsidiary or any newly issued Capital Stock of any existing
          Subsidiary acquired after the Original Closing Date by the Borrower or
          any of its Subsidiaries that is intended to be subject to the Lien
          created by any of the Pledge Agreements but which is not so subject,
          promptly (and in any event within 30 days after the acquisition
          thereof): (i) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such
          amendments to the relevant Pledge Agreements or such other documents
          as the Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or advisable to grant
          to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a Lien on
          such Capital Stock, (ii) take all actions necessary or advisable to
          cause such Lien to be duly perfected in accordance with all applicable
          Requirements of Law, including delivering all such original
          certificates evidencing such Capital Stock to the Administrative Agent
          together with undated stock powers executed in blank therefor, and
          (iii) if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required
          Lenders, deliver to the Administrative Agent legal opinions relating
          to the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) immediately
          preceding, which opinions shall be in form and substance, and from
          counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Borrower nor any of its
          Subsidiaries shall be required to grant to the Administrative Agent a
          Lien upon the Capital Stock of any Immaterial Subsidiary; provided
          that if an Immaterial Subsidiary ceases to be an Immaterial
          Subsidiary, Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be,
          shall within thirty (30) days of such event comply with the foregoing
          requirements."

                  (b)  With respect to any Person that, subsequent to the
          Original Closing Date, becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
          Borrower, promptly (and in any event within 30 days after such Person
          becomes a Subsidiary): (i) cause such new Subsidiary to become a party
          to the Subsidiary Guarantee and, to the extent such Subsidiary holds
          any Capital Stock of any Subsidiary that is not an Immaterial
          Subsidiary, to the Subsidiary

          Pledge Agreement and (ii) if requested by the Administrative Agent or
          the Required Lenders, deliver to the Administrative Agent legal
          opinions relating to the matters described in clause (i) immediately
          preceding, which opinions shall be in form and substance, and from
          counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Immaterial Subsidiary, Foreign
          Subsidiary or TCAS Subsidiary (except as provided below) of the
          Borrower or its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute a Subsidiary
          Guarantee or Subsidiary Pledge Agreement, and no more than 65% of the
          total combined voting power of the Capital Stock of or equity
          interests in (A) any direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary of the
          Borrower or (B) any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Borrower if
          more than 65% of the assets of such Subsidiary are securities of
          foreign companies (such determination to be made on the basis of fair
          market value), and no Subsidiary of any Person described in clause (A)
          or (B), shall be required to be pledged hereunder; provided, that if,
          after the consummation of any sale of a portion of Capital Stock of
          the TCAS Subsidiary, the TCAS Subsidiary thereafter becomes a Wholly
          Owned Subsidiary, then the TCAS Subsidiary shall become a party to the
          Subsidiary Guarantee and Subsidiary Pledge Agreement and Borrower
          shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days after such event
          occurs) comply with the requirements of this subsection 6.10(b) with
          respect to the TCAS Subsidiary."

          2.3     Schedule 4.14 to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as provided on Schedule 4.14 attached hereto.

          2.4     The last sentence in Section 10.6(c) of the Credit Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as provided below:

          required for any assignment which occurs at any time when any events
          described in clause (a) or (f) of Section 8 shall have occurred and be
          continuing."

          to or granted to, or held by, such Grantor while this Agreement is in
          effect; provided that if such Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary or if
