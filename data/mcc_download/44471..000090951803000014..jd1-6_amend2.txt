                                   Witnesseth:
                                   -----------

               WHEREAS, the Company and the Consultant desire to amend the
Consulting Agreement which they entered into as of March 12, 2002 and amended as
of August 30, 2002 (the "Consulting Agreement"), upon the terms and conditions
below.

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
conditions contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

               1. The first sentence of Section 1(a) of the Consulting Agreement
is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following sentence is substituted in
its place:

                     The Company hereby retains the Consultant and the
                     Consultant hereby accepts retention by the Company, as a
                     consultant on the terms and subject to the conditions set
                     forth herein, for the period which commenced as of February
                     14, 2002 and which will end on December 31, 2002, unless
                     terminated earlier as provided herein (the "Consulting
                     Period").

               2. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Consultant shall remain
entitled to the second installment of his retention bonus, subject to the terms
and conditions of the August 8, 2002 retention bonus letter agreement between
the Consultant and the Company, notwithstanding that the company may make
payment of the second installment of such retention bonus amounts to
participants in the retention bonus program after the end of the Consulting
Period.

               3. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Consulting
Agreement remains unmodified and in full force and effect.

           In witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this Second
Amendment as of the date first above written.
