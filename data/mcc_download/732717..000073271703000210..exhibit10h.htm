       <u>Non-Competition</u>.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, no coverage shall be provided under this Plan with
        respect to any Eligible Employee who shall, without the written consent of SBC, and while employed by SBC or any subsidiary thereof,
or within three (3) years after termination of employment from SBC or any subsidiary thereof, engage in competition with SBC or any
subsidiary thereof or with any business with which a subsidiary of SBC or an affiliated company has a substantial interest
(collectively referred to herein as "Employer business").  For purposes of this Plan, engaging in competition with any Employer

substantially similar business or activity is being carried on as an Employer business.  Such term shall not include owning a
nonsubstantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business that competes with an Employer business.  However, engaging in
competition with an Employer business shall include representing or providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any
person or entity that is engaged in competition with any Employer business or that takes a position adverse to any Employer
business.  Accordingly, coverage shall not be provided under this Plan if, within the time period and without the written consent
specified, Eligible Employee either engages directly in competitive activity or in any capacity in any location becomes employed by,
associated with, or renders service to any company, or parent or affiliate thereof, or any subsidiary of any of them, if any of them
is engaged in competition with an Employer business, regardless of the position or duties the Eligible Employee takes and regardless
of whether or not the employing company, or the company that Eligible Employee becomes associated with or renders service to, is
itself engaged in direct competition with an Employer business.</FONT></TD>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
1.   <u>General.</u>  The purpose of these guidelines is to list the procedures to be followed in administering the Executive Health
         Plan (&#147;EHP&#148;).</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Senior Vice President -
Human Resources will establish internal procedures and group insurance policies
with health carrier(s) as appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
2.  <u>Coverage Considerations.</u></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Eligible Employees:</u></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Coverage is provided only
for an Eligible Employee covered by a subsidiary&#146;s basic medical plan
(&#147;basic plan&#148;), except as otherwise provided for in Section 4 of the
Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Coverage continues during
periods of disability and during retirement in certain circumstances as
described in the Plan. Coverage during such periods shall be the same as
provided to active Eligible Employees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Coverage for a new Eligible
Employee is effective the first day of the month in which the employee is
declared to be eligible to participate in the Plan by the Chairman. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Coverage will cease on the last day of the month in which one of the following conditions exist:</FONT></P>

<ol type="a">
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               Eligible Employee is no longer a participant in the Basic Plan</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               termination of Eligible Employee from active service for reasons other than disability or the retirement of an
                  Eligible Employee who became an Eligible Employee before January 1, 1999</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               death of Eligible Employee (unless surviving dependents continue coverage under basic plan)</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               demotion of Eligible Employee so as to no longer be eligible to participate in the Plan</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               transfer to a subsidiary that will not bear expenses for the Eligible Employee to participate in the Plan</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               Eligible Employee engages in competitive activity</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               discontinuance of the Plan by SBC or a subsidiary</font>
</ol>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Dependents:</u></FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Coverage is provided for
dependents of a covered Eligible Employee if the dependents are covered by the
basic plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If coverage for a dependent
ceases under the basic plan, coverage under this Plan will cease with the same
effective date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If coverage for the
Eligible Employee under this Plan ceases for any reason, dependent coverage will
cease with the same effective date except where employee coverage ceases due to
death of the Eligible Employee, the Plan will continue in effect for surviving
dependents as long as the dependents are covered under the basic plan (through
automatic coverage or through payment of basic premiums) and are paying any
applicable premiums under this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
3.       <u>Enrollment.</u>  Upon approval as an Eligible Employee, enrollment in the basic plan and payment of any applicable premium under
         this Plan, the Eligible Employee and current dependents (provided they are also enrolled in the basic plan) shall be covered under
the Plan.  The Executive Compensation Administration (ECA) contact will forward a portfolio to the Eligible Employee including the
following:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
       Blank claim forms (5 to 10 copies)</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
       Blue return envelopes (5 to 10)</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
       Filing instructions</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
       I. D. Cards with Eligible Employee's name imprinted (for use for Eligible Employee, spouse, and eligible dependents)</FONT>
</ul>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
As a matter of convenience for the Eligible Employee, the ECA contact will advise the appropriate payroll office regarding the
enrollment and withholding of basic coverage premiums for dependents who are not already enrolled in the basic plan.  The Eligible
Employee must authorize and make premium payments under the basic plan in order for such dependents to obtain coverage under the
EHP.  There is no additional premium to be paid for EHP coverage for the dependent.  Withholding of dependent basic premiums for
retired Eligible Employees, where applicable, shall be handled in the same manner as other withholding arrangements for retired
executives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Each month, the ECA contact will provide the EHP carrier and subsidiary benefit administration groups with a list of Eligible
Employees currently enrolled in the Plan.  The ECA contact will provide updated dependent information to the carrier whenever new or
revised Dependent Enrollment Forms are received from Eligible Employees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
4.       <u>Eligible Charges.</u>  Charges for medical care services will be eligible for reimbursement under this Plan if such charges are
         deductible as medical expenses under the Internal Revenue Code.  Group health plan premiums and contributions are not considered
"services", and are therefore not covered under this Plan.  In general, medical expenses are defined to include any amounts paid for
the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the
body, and transportation for and essential to medical care.  Amounts paid for illegal operations or treatments are not eligible
medical expenses.  In addition, expenses incurred which are merely beneficial to the general health of an individual are also not
considered eligible medical expenses unless they are for the primary purpose of curing a particular disease or ailment and prescribed
by a doctor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Eligible Employees are encouraged to use basic plan cost management features, including pre-certification, continued stay, second
surgical opinion and designation of Primary Care Physician.  Use of these features is optional for Eligible Employees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
5.       <u>Annual Limits.</u>  The annual limits for charges which will be paid under the Plan are specified in the Plan.  Expenses
        incurred under provisions of basic medical, dental and vision plans are not counted against the Plan's limits.  The Plan's limits
apply to the following eligible charges:</FONT></P>

<ol type="a">
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
              Medical expenses not paid under a basic medical expense plan (deductibles, co-pay amounts, excluded charges, etc.,
                  but not premiums to enroll dependents in the basic plan); plus</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                Dental expenses not paid under basic dental plan (deductibles, co-pay amounts, excluded charges etc., but not
                  premiums to enroll dependents in the basic plan); plus</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
               All vision expenses not covered by basic vision plan, but not premiums to enroll dependents in the basic plan</font>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
When an Eligible Employee or dependent or the Eligible Employee's family exhausts annual coverage, the Eligible Employee will be
notified by the carrier.</font>
</ol>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
6.       <u>Claims Processing.</u>  Eligible Employees or their Providers (Doctors, Hospitals, etc.) should submit all basic medical, dental
         and vision plan and EHP claims to the EHP carrier (UnitedHealthcare).  In no case should claims be submitted for processing under the
procedures of the basic medical, dental and vision plans. UnitedHealthcare will coordinate processing for both basic and EHP claims
to reduce administrative efforts for Eligible Employees.  Retired Eligible Employees who are eligible for coverage under the Plan and
who are eligible for Medicare should file with Medicare first.  See Medicare Section below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
To submit a claim, Eligible Employees or their Providers should use a claim form (see Attachment 1) and one of the blue envelopes
provided in the enrollment portfolio.  Documentation of service provided should be attached to the claim form.  Additional forms and
envelopes are available from the carrier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The carrier will receive completed forms, verify participation and make payment to the Eligible Employee or to the Provider as
appropriate.  The Explanation of Benefits statement will be forwarded to the Eligible Employee when payments are made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Medical and Dental Claims.</u>  The carrier will allocate claim charges to either basic medical or dental plan coverage, EHP coverage or
non-covered charges.  The Eligible Employee or the Eligible Employee's Provider will be reimbursed for all charges except those not
eligible under either a basic medical or dental plan or EHP.  The carrier will use the separation of charges between plans to produce
reports and to track against annual limits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Vision Claims.</u>  The carrier will allocate claim charges to either basic vision plan coverage, EHP coverage or non-covered charges.
The Eligible Employee or the Eligible Employee's Provider will be reimbursed for all charges except those not eligible under either a
basic vision plan or EHP.  The carrier will use the separation of charges between plans to produce reports and to track against
annual limits. Eligible Employees should not submit vision claims to carriers other than the EHP carrier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Medicare.</u>  Any retired Eligible Employee eligible for coverage under the Plan or his or her dependents any of whom are eligible for
Medicare shall file claims with Medicare first.  Expenses not reimbursed by Medicare should then be filed with UnitedHealthcare using
the Executive Health Plan Claim Form.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Coordination by Administrators.</u>  The ECA contact will instruct claims administrators for basic plans (vision, dental, medical) to
forward all Eligible Employee claims to the EHP carrier for processing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<u>Release of Information.</u>  If requested by a Provider, it will be necessary for the Eligible Employee to sign a form to authorize the
carrier to obtain additional information from a Provider.  In those cases, the carrier will forward an information release form
directly to the Eligible Employee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
7.       <u>I. D. Cards.</u>  Each enrollment portfolio includes I.D. cards for the Eligible Employee and eligible spouse and dependents.
         The dependent's name will be shown on the dependent's card.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Additional cards can be obtained by contacting the ECA Group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Each card will contain a carrier telephone number dedicated to the EHP.  This number is also on the claim forms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
8.       <u>Prescriptions.</u>  Participants in the EHP should use the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program or purchase prescriptions from
         a pharmacy, as appropriate.  The Eligible Employee should attach his/her receipt for any amount not covered by the basic Plan to a
claim form, and forward to the carrier for full reimbursement.  Only prescription medicines are eligible for reimbursement.
Over-the-counter medicines (cold tablets, aspirin, etc.) and hygienic supplies (contact lens solution, eye drops, etc.) are not
covered under the plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
9.      <u> Billing.</u>  The carrier will issue insurance premium bills at the beginning of each quarter to the following SBC entities:</FONT></P>


<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
      SBC ECA Group (for corporate staff Eligible Employees)</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        Each subsidiary's Human Resources/Personal  Administration Group (for subsidiary Eligible Employees).</FONT>
</ul>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Quarterly payments are due to the carrier by the end of the first month in the quarter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Bills will provide sufficient detail to show the following:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        Amounts above that allocated to basic medical, dental and vision plans</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        EHP premiums</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        Other EHP charges/credits</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        SBC code</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
       State code</FONT>
<li><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
        Individual bills for each Eligible Employee as requested by the employing subsidiary</FONT>
</ul>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
10.      <u>Reports.</u>  The carrier will issue quarterly reports to the SBC ECA contact.  These will include claim-to-premium
        reconciliation data for use in forecasting end-of-year true-ups and determining whether or not accruals will be required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
11.      <u>Accruals.</u>  If claim-to premium reconciliation data indicates claims are significantly exceeding premiums during a quarter,
         accruals should be considered during the year.  At the end of the year, an accrual is generally required unless a year-end true-up
bill is not expected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
12.      <u>Taxes.</u>  If receipt of coverage/benefits under this Plan results in taxable income, an Eligible Employee's income will be
        grossed-up.</FONT></P>
