                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.2



                       AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING NOTE


EXECUTED AS OF THE 1ST DAY OF DECEMBER, 2002                AMOUNT $3,000,000.00


                  FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned jointly and severally
promise to pay to the order of LASALLE BUSINESS CREDIT, INC. (hereinafter,
together with any holder hereof, called "LaSalle"), at the main office of
LaSalle, 135 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, the principal sum of
THREE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($3,000,000.00) plus the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all advances made by LaSalle to the undersigned pursuant to
and in accordance with Paragraph 2 of the Loan Agreement (as hereinafter
defined) in excess of such amount, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all advances made by LaSalle to the undersigned pursuant to and in
accordance with Paragraph 2 of the Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal
balance shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Loan
Agreement. The undersigned further promises to pay interest on the outstanding
principal amount hereof on the dates and at the rates provided in the Loan
Agreement from the date hereof until payment in full hereof.

                  This Amended and Restated Revolving Note (the "Note") is
referred to in and was delivered pursuant to that certain Loan and Security
Agreement, as it has been and may be amended from time to time, together with
all exhibits thereto, dated July 31, 2000, between LaSalle and HEI, Inc. (the
"Loan Agreement"). This Note is issued and accepted not in payment or
satisfaction, but as an amendment and restatement of that certain Amended and
Restated Revolving Note dated October 31, 2001 issued by HEI and payable to the
order of the Lender in the original principal amount of $5,000,000. All terms
which are capitalized and used herein (which are not otherwise defined herein)
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.

                  The undersigned hereby authorizes LaSalle to charge any
account of the undersigned for all sums due hereunder. If payment hereunder
becomes due and payable on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday under the laws of
the United States or the State of Minnesota, the due date thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding business day, and interest shall be payable
thereon at the rate specified during such extension. Credit shall be given for
payments made in the manner and at the times provided in the Loan Agreement. It
is the intent of the parties that the rate of interest and other charges to the
undersigned under this Revolving Note shall be lawful and shall be limited to
the maximum nonusurious rate of interest permitted by law; therefore, if for any
reason the interest or other charges payable hereunder are found by a court of
competent jurisdiction, in a final determination, to exceed the limit which
LaSalle may lawfully charge the undersigned, then the obligation to pay interest
or other charges shall automatically be reduced to such limit and, if any amount
in excess of such limit shall have been paid, then such amount shall be refunded
to the undersigned.

                  The principal and all accrued interest hereunder may be
prepaid by the undersigned, in part or in full, at any time; provided, however,
that if the undersigned prepays all of the Liabilities prior to the end of the
Original Term or any Renewal Term, the undersigned shall pay a prepayment fee as
provided in the Loan Agreement.

                  The undersigned waives the benefit of any law that would
otherwise restrict or limit LaSalle in the exercise of its right, which is
hereby acknowledged, to set-off against the Liabilities, without notice and at
any time hereafter, any indebtedness matured or unmatured owing from LaSalle to
the undersigned. The undersigned waives every defense, counterclaim or setoff
which the undersigned may now have or hereafter may have to any action by
LaSalle in enforcing this Note and/or any of the other Liabilities, or in
enforcing LaSalle's rights in the Collateral and ratifies and confirms whatever
LaSalle may do pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Loan Agreement and with
respect to the Collateral and agrees that LaSalle shall not be liable for any
error in judgment or mistakes of fact or law.

                  The undersigned, any other party liable with respect to the
Liabilities and any and all endorsers and accommodation parties, and each one of
them, if more than one, waive any and all presentment, demand, notice of
dishonor, protest, and all other notices and demands in connection with the
enforcement of LaSalle's rights hereunder.
