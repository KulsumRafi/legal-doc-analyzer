sales price of the Finished Product in the combination when sold separately and B is the total sales price of all other active ingredients in the combination when sold separately. If the Finished
Product and the other active ingredients are not sold separately, the percentage of the total cost of the combination product attributed to Cost of Product shall be multiplied times the sales price of
the combination product to arrive at New Sales. For all Licensed Product used or consumed by others than Licensee, Licensee shall be entitled to deduct (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED) from Net
