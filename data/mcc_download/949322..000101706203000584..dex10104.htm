be payable on the date hereof.&#160; Interest shall be paid in arrears and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and actual number of days elapsed for any whole or partial month in which interest on this Note is being calculated and shall

which such payment was due (and not the date of the payment default)</font></p> <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1</font></p>

of the close of business announced on the last business day of the month immediately preceding the Rate Adjustment Date; in the event Bloomberg ceases publication or ceases to publish the one month LIBOR, Holder shall select a comparable publication
to determine the one month LIBOR and provide notice thereof to Borrower; LIBOR may or may not be the lowest rate based upon the market for U.S. Dollar deposits in the London Interbank Eurodollar Market at which Holder prices loans on the date on

Holder shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of such monthly payment (and the corrected amount of the Note Rate, if applicable) and (a) if the corrected amount of such monthly payment represents an increase thereof, Borrower shall,
within ten (10) calendar days after the date of such notice, pay to Holder any sums that Borrower would have otherwise been obligated under this Note to pay to Holder had the amount of such monthly payment not been miscalculated or (b) if the
corrected amount of such monthly payment represents a decrease thereof, and Borrower is not otherwise in breach or default under any of the terms and provisions of the Note or the Loan Agreement of even date herewith by and between Borrower and
Lender (the <b>&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;</b>), Borrower shall, within ten (10) calendar days thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise been obligated to pay to Holder had the amount of such monthly payment not been

occurred which materially and adversely affects the London Interbank Eurodollar Market at which Holder prices loans on the date on which the Note Rate is determined by Holder as set forth above, or (b) at any time Holder shall have determined in
good faith (which determination shall be conclusive) that the making, maintenance or funding of any part of the Loan has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by Holder in good faith with any law or guideline or interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or with any request or directive of any such governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) then, and in any such event,

Borrower of the amount determined in good faith (using any averaging and attribution methods) by Holder (which determination shall be conclusive) to be necessary to compensate Holder for such increase, reduction or imposition and, if Borrower is by
