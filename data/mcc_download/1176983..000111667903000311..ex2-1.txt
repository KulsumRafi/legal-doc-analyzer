            C. Seller  desires to sell to Purchaser,  and  Purchaser  desires to
purchase  from Seller,  substantially  all the assets of the  Business,  as more
particularly described below.

            NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises and the mutual
covenants  contained  herein,  the parties hereto hereby  mutually  covenant and
agree as follows:

herein, at the Closing (as hereinafter defined),  Seller agrees to sell, convey,
transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from
Seller,  free and clear of all liens,  mortgages,  charges,  security interests,

the  operation  of the  Business;  and (d) such  other  Liens as are  listed  in

            1.2.2  During the period  beginning  on the Closing  Date and ending
one (1) year  following the Closing Date (the  "Collection  Period"),  Purchaser
shall pay to the  Seller,  or such  other  Person as Seller may  direct,  within
fifteen (15) days  following the end of each calendar month (each, a "Collection
Month") during the Collection Period, an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying  (A) the Applicable  Percentage (as defined below) by (B) the excess
(the  "Excess  Amount") of (x) the sum of all amounts  collected  or received by
Purchaser or Parent (the "Collected Accounts Receivable") during such Collection
Month from the  Accounts  Receivable  acquired  by  Purchaser  pursuant  to this
Agreement  and  (y) the  sum of the  accounts  payable  amounts  assumed  by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, if any, directly related to such Collected
Accounts  Receivable to be paid or payable to the list owners as provided in the
applicable  Contracts  with such list  owners.  For  purposes  of clarity and as
illustrated  below,  where  only a  percentage  of  the  Account  Receivable  is
collected  in  any  particular  month  or  during  the  Collection   Period,  as
applicable, only that percentage of the account payable directly related to such
Collected  Accounts  Receivable  shall be  deemed  paid or  payable  during  the
applicable  month or the  Collection  Period,  as  applicable,  for  purposes of
determining the Excess Amount by which to multiply the Applicable Percentage.

            For  purposes of this Section  1.2.2,  the  "Applicable  Percentage"
shall  equal  ninety-two  and one  half  percent  (92.5%)  with  respect  to all
Collected  Accounts  Receivable  collected  or received by  Purchaser  or Parent
during  the  first six (6)  months  of the  Collection  Period  and shall  equal
forty-six  and  one-quarter  percent  (46.25%)  with  respect  to all  Collected
Accounts Receivable collected or received by Purchaser or Parent during the last
six (6) months of the  Collection  Period.  In  addition,  for  purposes of this
Section 1.2.2, in calculating any Collected Accounts  Receivable  amount,  third
party  collection  fees and  expenses  (if any) paid or payable by  Purchaser or
Parent in connection  with the collection of such Collected  Account  Receivable
shall not be taken into account if such fees are  incurred  during the first six
(6)  months of the  Collection  Period,  and  third  party  collection  fees and
expenses (if any) paid or payable by Purchaser or Parent in connection  with the
collection of such Collected Accounts  Receivable shall be taken into account if
such fees are incurred during the last six (6) months of the Collection Period.

            For  illustrative  purposes  only, if Purchaser  acquires an Account
Receivable for $100.00 and assumes a related account payable to a list owner for
$90.00, then for every $1.00 collected or received by Purchaser or Parent during
the first six (6) months of the  Collection  Period with respect to such Account
Receivable,  the Excess  Amount with  respect to such  dollar  would be equal to
$0.10 and  Purchaser  shall  pay to  Seller  $0.0925  within  fifteen  (15) days
following  the end of the calendar  month during which such dollar was collected
or received by Purchaser or Parent and for every $1.00  collected or received by
Purchaser or Parent during the last six (6) months of the Collection Period with
respect to such  Account  Receivable,  the Excess  Amount  with  respect to such
dollar would be $0.10 and Purchaser  shall pay to Seller $0.04625 within fifteen
(15) days  following the end of the calendar  month during which such dollar was
collected  or received by  Purchaser or Parent.  In this  example,  if Purchaser
collected  $50.00 with respect to such  $100.00  Account  Receivable  during the
first month of the Collection Period,  then Purchaser shall pay to Seller


                                      -5-
<PAGE>


$4.625 within  fifteen (15) days  following the end of the calendar month during
which such  amount was  collected  or received by  Purchaser  or Parent,  and if
Purchaser  collected  $50.00 with  respect to such  $100.00  Account  Receivable
during the seventh month of the Collection  Period,  then Purchaser would pay to
Seller  $2.3125 within fifteen (15) days following the end of the calendar month
during which such amount was  collected  or received by Purchaser or Parent.  In
addition,  if in the above  example  Purchaser  collected  the $50.00 during the
first six months of the  Collection  Period with the assistance of a third party
collection agency and paid such collection  agency $10.00,  then Purchaser would
be deemed  to have  received  $50.00  for  purposes  of the  Collected  Accounts
Receivable and the  collection  fees would be  disregarded.  If,  however,  such
collection  was made  during the last six (6) months of the  Collection  Period,
then such  collection  fees would be taken into account and  Purchaser  would be
deemed  to  have  received  $40.00  for  purposes  of  the  Collected   Accounts
Receivable.

            Purchaser  acknowledges  and agrees that if,  during the  Collection
Period,  it or Parent  should  collect or receive  any amount from a client with
whom  Purchaser  has  an  outstanding  account  receivable  balance,  then  such
collected amount shall be treated as a Collected  Accounts  Receivable for which
payment  shall be made by Purchaser to Seller  pursuant to this Section 1.2.2 if
(x) such client  designates  that its  payment is being made  against an Account
Receivable  acquired  by  Purchaser  hereunder  or  (y) in  the  absence  of any
designation by such client,  if Purchaser  determines  (in accordance  with this
Section  1.2.2) that client  intends  such payment to be made against an Account
Receivable acquired by Purchaser. If (a) such client designates that its payment
is being made against an account  receivable  that was not acquired by Purchaser
hereunder, or (b) in the absence of any designation by such client, if Purchaser
determines (in  accordance  with this Section 1.2.2) that client does not intend
such  payment to be made  against an Account  Receivable  acquired by  Purchaser
hereunder,  then such  payment  shall not be  treated  as a  Collected  Accounts
Receivable  for which payment shall be made pursuant to this Section  1.2.2.  If
such  client  fails to specify  whether  such  payment is being made  against an
outstanding  Account  Receivable  balance  or fails  to  specify  which  account
receivable  balance is being paid if there is more than one  account  receivable
balance  applicable  to such  client,  Purchaser  shall  act in good  faith  and
reasonably  to  determine  whether  such client  intends such payment to be made
against an outstanding  Account Receivable  acquired by Purchaser hereunder and,
if there is more than one account  receivable balance applicable to such client,
which  account  receivable  balance  is  being  paid.  In  all  instances,   the
specification  made by each client as to which  account  receivable it is paying
shall be binding on the parties hereto for purposes of this Section  1.2.2.  The
sum of all payments made to Seller under this Section 1.2.2 shall be referred to
as the "Additional Cash  Consideration." It is understood that amounts collected
by Purchaser or Parent after the  Collection  Period on the Accounts  Receivable
purchased by Purchaser  hereunder  shall be the property of Purchaser  and shall
not be subject to the  provisions  of this Section  1.2.2.  For purposes of this
Agreement,  "Person" means any  individual,  sole  proprietorship,  partnership,
limited liability  company,  joint venture,  trust,  incorporated  organization,
association, corporation, institution, public benefit corporation, any national,
federal, state, municipal,  local,  territorial,  foreign or other government or
any


                                      -6-

department,   commission,   board,  bureau,  agency,   regulatory  authority  or
instrumentality thereof, any court, judicial, administrative or arbitral body or
public or private tribunal or other entity.

            During the Collection  Period,  Purchaser  shall treat,  and use the
same efforts to collect,  all Accounts Receivable acquired by Purchaser pursuant
to this  Agreement  in the same manner as Parent  treats and attempts to collect
its own accounts receivable.  Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each
calendar month during the Collection  Period,  Purchaser shall provide a written
report to Seller with each  payment of  Additional  Cash  Consideration  for the
calendar  month  preceding  such report,  each such report to show in reasonable
detail the  customer  payment  information,  including  the  individual  amounts
received by Purchaser,  customer names and invoice  numbers.  Purchaser  further
agrees  that  during  the  Collection  Period,  it shall  accurately  and fairly
maintain its books of accounts and records in  accordance  with GAAP (as defined
below). In addition, during the Collection Period, Purchaser shall permit Seller
and its  representatives to have access to and to examine  Purchaser's books and
records (and to copy and make extracts  therefrom) at such reasonable  times and
intervals as Seller may request for purposes of reviewing  the  Additional  Cash
Consideration payments paid or payable by Purchaser.

            1.2.3  Earnout Provision.

                        (a) As additional  consideration for the Assets,  Seller
shall have the right to receive  additional cash (the  "Earnout"),  payable,  if
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.2.3.

                        (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Revenue" shall mean
all revenue  (calculated in accordance  with GAAP whether or not such revenue is
collected, provided, however, that with respect to amounts invoiced prior to the
Closing  relating to mailings  occurring  after the Closing,  the term "Revenue"
shall not include any such amounts  except to the extent  collected by Purchaser
or Parent)  generated from billings,  exchange charges,  analytical  charges and
mail fulfillment charges (collectively, "Sales"): (i) related to or arising from
the operation of the Assets (including without limitation, all Revenue generated
hereunder at any place by any Person from Sales  related to or arising under the
list management  Contracts  assigned  hereunder or the AMSS Software  acquired),
(ii) to the extent not  included in clause (i) above,  related to or arising out
of the office or the analytical and mail fulfillment  team presently  located at
7616 Currell  Boulevard,  Woodbury,  MN 55125 (the  "Minnesota  Office") or such
future location to which such office or analytical and mail fulfillment team may
move and (iii) to the extent  not  included  in clause (i) above,  related to or
arising out of the work of the sales team (the "Max Sales Team") operating under
Britt  Vatne's  management  (including  any  successor to Ms.  Vatne)  presently
located at 400 Columbus Avenue,  Valhalla,  NY 10595 (the "Valhalla  Office") or
such future location to which such sales team may move  (including  future sales
people hired with respect to the Max Sales Team or future sales people reporting
under Britt Vatne (or any successor to Ms. Vatne) (whether to replace any former
Max Sales Team  employee or as an addition to the


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


Max Sales Team)).  Parent and Purchaser agree to maintain the separate existence
of the Max Sales Team for a period  beginning  on the Closing Date and ending on
the first  anniversary  of the Closing  Date;  provided,  however,  that neither
Purchaser nor Parent shall be prohibited from  terminating in good faith without
cause the  employment  of any Max Sales Team employee or from  terminating  with
cause the employment of any Max Sales Team employee.


                        (c) If  Revenue  during  the  first  365 days  after the
Closing Date (the "Earnout  Period") is equal to at least $2,500,000 (the "First
Target"),  then  Purchaser  shall pay to Seller an amount equal to $500,000 (the
"First  Earnout").  If Revenue  during the  Earnout  Period is equal to at least
$3,500,000 (the "Second Target"),  then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount,
in addition to the First Earnout, equal to $1,000,000 (the "Second Earnout" and,
together with the First Earnout,  the "Earnout");  provided,  however,  that the
Second  Earnout shall be increased an additional  $0.50 for every $1.00 that the
Revenue for the Earnout  Period  exceeds  the Second  Target.  In the event that
Revenue  during  the  Earnout  Period is less than the  First  Target,  no First
Earnout shall be payable by Purchaser or Parent hereunder, and in the event that
Revenue  during the  Earnout  Period is less than the Second  Target,  no Second
Earnout shall be payable by Purchaser or Parent hereunder.

                        (d) The  Earnout,  if any,  shall  be  promptly  paid by
Purchaser to Seller, or to such Persons as Seller may direct, as follows:

                           (i) The First  Earnout  shall be paid  within  thirty
(30) days after the date on which Revenue exceeds $2,500,000; and

                           (ii)  The  Second  Earnout  shall  be paid in two (2)
equal installments on the ninetieth (90th) and one hundred and twentieth (120th)
days after the end of the Earnout Period.

To the extent Seller disputes Purchaser's calculation of the Earnout, Seller and
Purchaser  shall  negotiate  in good faith for thirty (30) days to resolve  such
dispute  and  payment of the Earnout  shall be  deferred  until such  dispute is
resolved.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of Article VI hereof,  to the extent
Seller and  Purchaser  are unable to resolve  such  dispute  within  such 30 day
period,  Seller and  Purchaser  shall  select a mutually  acceptable  nationally
recognized  independent  accounting  firm  (other than an  accounting  firm then
engaged by Seller or Purchaser) to resolve such dispute  within thirty (30) days

                         ------------------------------
                                    OF SELLER
                                    ---------

            As an  inducement  to  Purchaser  and  Parent  to  enter  into  this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby, Seller hereby
represents and warrants to, and covenants with, Purchaser and Parent as follows:

            3.1         Organization and Authority.  Seller (a) is a corporation
duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good  standing  under the laws of the
State of Delaware,  (b) has full corporate  power and authority to own and lease
the Assets and to carry on the Business as and where the Assets are now owned or
leased and the Business is now conducted, and (c) is qualified to do business as
a foreign  corporation in each jurisdiction  where the ownership or operation of
its properties or conduct of its business  requires such  qualification,  except
where the failure to be so  qualified,  when taken  together with all other such
failures, is not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            For purposes of this Agreement,  "Material Adverse Effect" means any
change in or effect that,  individually or in the aggregate (taking into account
all other such changes or effects) is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially
adverse to the Business or the  liabilities,  results of operations or condition
(financial  or  otherwise)  of the  Assets or  Business;  provided  that (a) the
failure  to retain or hire  employees  and the  consequences  thereof  shall not
itself be deemed to be a Material  Adverse Effect or itself be considered in any
determination   of  whether  a  Material  Adverse  Effect  has  occurred  or  is
continuing,  (b) circumstances,  developments,  changes in or effects on general
economic or financial or securities  market  conditions in the United States and
elsewhere  or changes  affecting  the


                                      -10-
<PAGE>


industry  generally  in  which  the  Business  operates  (whether  or  not  such
circumstances,  developments,  changes  or effects  are the  direct or  indirect
result  of the  initiation,  continuation,  escalation  or  cessation  of  armed
hostilities  involving or the declaration of war by or against the United States
or its territories),  provided that such changes do not affect the Assets or the
Business in a materially  disproportionate way, shall not itself be deemed to be
a  Material  Adverse  Effect or itself be  considered  in any  determination  of
whether a  Material  Adverse  Effect  has  occurred  or is  continuing,  (c) the
initiation,  continuation,  escalation or cessation of armed hostilities against
or involving or the  declaration  of war by or against the United  States or its
territories shall not itself be deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect or itself
be  considered in any  determination  of whether a Material  Adverse  Effect has
occurred or is  continuing,  provided that such changes do not affect the Assets
or the Business in a materially  disproportionate  way, (d) any change or effect
caused by or relating to, the announcement of the  transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  shall not itself be deemed to be a Material  Adverse  Effect or
itself be considered in any  determination  of whether a Material Adverse Effect
has occurred or is continuing, (e) any change or effect relating to the Seller's
online  business  and  operations  shall not  itself be deemed to be a  Material
Adverse  Effect  or itself  be  considered  in any  determination  of  whether a
Material  Adverse Effect has occurred or is  continuing,  (f) any adverse change
arising from or relating to any change in accounting  requirements or principles
or any change in applicable  laws,  rules or regulations  or the  interpretation
thereof shall not itself be deemed to be a Material  Adverse Effect or itself be
considered  in any  determination  of  whether a  Material  Adverse  Effect  has
occurred or is  continuing  and (g) any loss of  customers  from the Business to
Purchaser or Parent shall not itself be deemed to be a Material  Adverse  Effect
or itself be  considered  in any  determination  of whether a  Material  Adverse
Effect has occurred or is continuing.

            3.2         Absence of Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery
of this  Agreement  by  Seller,  the  compliance  by  Seller  with the terms and
conditions   hereof  nor  the   consummation  by  Seller  of  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby  will (a)  conflict  with any of the terms,  conditions  or
provisions of the certificate of organization, bylaws or other charter documents
of Seller,  (b) violate any provision of, or require any consent,  authorization
or  approval  under,  any  law or  administrative  regulation  or any  judicial,
administrative or arbitration order, award, judgment, writ, injunction or decree
applicable to the Assets or the Business,  or any governmental permit or license
issued to Seller,  (c)  violate or be in  conflict  with,  result in a breach or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or
accelerate or permit the acceleration of the performance  required by, or except
as set forth in Schedule 3.2 annexed hereto, require any consent,  authorization
or approval  under,  any term or  provision  of any Lien,  lease,  agreement  or
instrument to which Seller is a party or by which the Business or the Assets are
bound, (d) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Assets or (e) give
to others any rights or interests (including rights of purchase,  termination or
cancellation) under any such Lien, lease, agreement or instrument, except in the
case  of  (b),  (c),  (d) or (e)  above,  for a  conflict,  breach,  default  or
acceleration  that does not render  consummation  of the Closing  illegal and is
not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            3.3         Power and Authority.

                        3.3.1  Seller  has all  requisite  corporate  power  and
authority  and has taken all  corporate  action  necessary  in order to execute,
deliver  and carry out all the terms and  provisions  of this  Agreement  and to
perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement.  Seller has taken, or caused to
have been taken,  all necessary  action,  corporate or  otherwise,  to authorize
Seller's  execution,   delivery  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  and  the
consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  does not  require  the  approval of Seller's
stockholders.

                        3.3.2 This Agreement constitutes, and upon the execution
and  delivery by Seller of the other  agreements  among the parties  referred to
herein and each instrument and certificate  delivered by Seller pursuant hereto,
such agreements, instruments and certificates shall constitute, the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
fraudulent  conveyance,  reorganization,  moratorium  and other  similar laws of
general  application  relating to or affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors'
rights  and  to  general  equitable   principles  (the  "Bankruptcy  and  Equity
Exception").

            3.4         Financial Statements. Seller has previously delivered or
made available to Purchaser (a) an unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of
December  31, 2002 (the  "Balance  Sheet  Date") and an  unaudited  statement of
revenue for the twelve month period then ended for the Business (such  financial
statements,   collectively,  the  "Financial  Statements").  The  balance  sheet
included in the Financial Statements fairly presents,  in all material respects,
the  financial  position  of the  Business as of its date and the  statement  of
revenue included in the Financial  Statements  fairly presents,  in all material
respects,  the revenue of the Business for the period set forth therein (subject
to footnotes and normal year-end audit adjustments),  in each case in accordance
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States  ("GAAP")
consistently  applied  (except for the absence of footnotes  and year-end  audit
adjustments).

            3.5         Title to Property; Encumbrances.

                        3.5.1  Except as set  forth on  Schedule  3.5.1  annexed
hereto,  the Assets are all of the assets  necessary  to conduct the Business of
Seller as currently being  conducted.  Seller has, and upon  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing, Purchaser will have,
good and marketable title to all of the Assets, real and personal,  moveable and
immovable,  tangible and intangible,  free and clear of any and all Liens (other
than the Permitted Liens and other than Liens which do not materially affect the
value  of such  property  or do not  materially  interfere  with the use of such
property by Seller).

                        3.5.2 Seller owns no real  property and, with respect to
the  Business,  does not lease or license  any  personal  property  to any third
party.  Schedule  3.5.2  annexed  hereto  contains  a list of all real  property
leases, licenses and personal property leases relating


                                      -12-
<PAGE>


primarily  to the Business  under which  Seller is the lessee or  licensee.  All
leases and licenses relating  primarily to the Business pursuant to which Seller
leases  or  licenses  from  others  real or  personal  property  are  valid  and
subsisting in full force and effect in accordance with their  respective  terms,
and there is not,  under any real property  lease,  personal  property  lease or
license,  any existing  material  default by or event of default (or event that,
with notice or passage of time, or both,  would constitute a material default by
Seller, or would constitute a basis of force majeure or other claim of excusable
delay or nonperformance).  To Seller's  knowledge,  there is not, under any real
property lease,  personal property lease or license set forth on Schedule 3.5.2,
any existing material default by or event of default (or event that, with notice
or passage of time, or both, would  constitute a material  default) by any other
party thereto.  Except as set forth in Schedule  3.5.2, no such lease or license
will  require  the  consent of the lessor or  licensor  to or as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            3.6         Proprietary Information.

                        3.6.1 Schedule 3.6.1 annexed hereto  contains a true and
complete list of all Internet domain names, letters patent, patent applications,
trade names, trademarks, service marks, trademark and service mark registrations
and applications,  copyrights, copyright registrations and applications,  grants
of a license or right to Seller with respect to the foregoing, both domestic and
foreign,  claimed by Seller and used or proposed to be used by Seller  primarily
in the conduct of the Business,  whether registered or not (collectively herein,
"Registered Rights").  Except as described in such Schedule 3.6.1, Seller is not
obligated  or  under  any  liability  whatever  to make any  payments  by way of
royalties,  fees or otherwise to any owner or licensor of, or other claimant to,
any  Registrable  Right with  respect to the use  thereof in the  conduct of the
Business or otherwise.

                        3.6.2  Except as set  forth on  Schedule  3.6.2  annexed
hereto,  Seller owns, is transferring such ownership to Purchaser  hereunder and
has the  unrestricted  right to use every trade  secret,  customer  and supplier
list,  promotional idea,  marketing and purchasing  strategy,  computer program,
discovery,  know-how,  confidential data and all other intellectual property and
information  required for the  operation of the Business  (collectively  herein,
"Proprietary  Information"),  free and  clear of any  right,  equity or claim of
others. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,  "Proprietary Information" shall
not  include  the lists  owned by  customers  of the  Business,  which lists are
managed by Seller as part of the Business.

                        3.6.3  Seller  has  not  sold,  transferred,   assigned,
licensed or subjected to any right,  Lien,  encumbrance or claim of others,  any
Registrable Rights or Proprietary Information or any interest therein. There are
no claims or demands of any Person  pertaining to, or any  proceedings  that are
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,  threatened,  which challenge the rights
of Seller in respect of any Registrable Rights or Proprietary Information.

                        3.6.4 Schedule  3.6.4 annexed hereto  indicates the name
and address of any Person which owns any patent, patent application,  trademark,
trademark  application,


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


trade name or copyright  primarily used by Seller in the Business.  There are no
outstanding  Liens,  whether  written,  oral or implied,  inconsistent  with the
transfer of the right,  title and interest of Seller in all of Seller's patents,
patent applications,  trademarks, copyrighted works, trademarks, trade names and
service  marks  which  are to be  transferred  to  Purchaser  pursuant  to  this
Agreement.  All required annuities,  renewal fees, maintenance fees, amendments,
and/or other  filings which are necessary to preserve and maintain in full force
and effect the patents,  patent  applications,  trademarks,  copyrighted  works,
trademarks, trade names and service marks identified in such Schedule 3.6.4 have
been filed and/or paid. Each of the patents, trademark registrations,  copyright
registrations,  trademarks,  trade names and service  marks  identified  in such
Schedule  3.6.4  was  obtained  in  compliance  with  the  statutes,  rules  and
regulations  governing  the  issuance  of  patents,   trademark   registrations,
copyright registrations,  trademarks, trade names and service marks. To Seller's
knowledge,  the  use,  marketing  and or sale of any  products  presently  used,
marketed  or sold by the  Business  do not  infringe  any  patents,  trademarks,
copyrights  or  other  proprietary  rights  of any  third  parties.  Seller  has
furnished  or made  available  to  Purchaser  a true  and  complete  list of all
drawings, sketches and blueprints used by Seller in connection with the Business
and has, as of the date hereof,  furnished to Purchaser the source codes used by
Seller in connection with the Business.

            3.7         Insurance.  Seller  maintains  insurance  policies  with
respect to the operation of the Business  ("Insurance  Policies") with reputable
insurers  against such risks and in such amounts as  management  reasonably  has
determined to be prudent in  accordance  with  industry  practices.  To Seller's
knowledge,  all  Insurance  Policies are in full force and effect.  Schedule 3.7
annexed  hereto sets forth a list of all such Insurance  Policies  maintained by
the Seller  since May 14,  2001 and a summary  description  of all  claims  with
respect to the Business made under any such the Insurance Policies since May 14,
2001.

            3.8         Employees and Labor Matters. Schedule 3.8 annexed hereto
contains a true and complete  list of all current  employees of Seller  relating
primarily to the Business and  describes  their base  compensation,  bonuses and
other  compensation  during the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.8 annexed  hereto,  all such  employees,  as of the date
hereof,  are actively at work (or on vacation or on temporary sick leave) and no
such  employee is currently  on a leave of absence,  suspension,  extended  sick
leave (more than two weeks),  short or longer term  disability,  family leave or
military leave. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8 annexed hereto, none of such
Seller's  employees  is subject to any  collective  bargaining  agreement or any
written employment  agreement to which Seller is a party or is bound.  Except in
each case as is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have
a Material  Adverse  Effect,  with respect to the  Business,  the Business is in
compliance with all federal and state laws respecting  employment and employment
practices and has not engaged in any unfair labor practice.  To the knowledge of
Seller,  no union or other labor  organization  has attempted to organize any of
the  employees of Seller  relating to the  Business.  Seller is not aware of any
worker's  compensation  or similar claims  relating to or involving the Business
that has been filed, or threatened to be filed,  with Seller or any governmental
authority  and is  currently  pending.  Seller has made

<PAGE>


available to Purchaser  copies of all  currently  effective  employee  handbooks
utilized in connection  with the Business since May 14, 2001.  Since October 31,
2002,  there has not been in respect of the Business  any plant  closing or mass
layoff  of  employees  as those  terms  are  defined  in the  Worker  Adjustment
Retraining  and  Notification  Act of 1988, as amended,  or any similar state or
local law or regulation  applicable to employees of the Business.  There has not
been in respect of the Business any plant closing or mass layoff of employees as
those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act
of 1988, as amended,  or any similar state or local law or regulation.*****

retirement,  profit-sharing,  thrift, savings,  employee stock ownership,  stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, employment,  termination,
severance,  compensation,  medical,  health,  welfare,  fringe benefits or other
material  plan,  policy,  agreement  or other  arrangement  that covers  current
employees or  directors  of Seller with  respect to service for Seller  relating
primarily to the Business (the  "Compensation  or Benefit  Plans") and any trust
agreement  or  insurance  contract  forming a part of any such  Compensation  or
Benefit Plans is listed in Schedule 3.8 and has been made available to Purchaser
prior to the date hereof.  Except in each case as is not, individually or in the
aggregate,  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to
the Business,  the Seller is not in default with respect to any  Compensation or
Benefit Plans. No Compensation or Benefit Plan has terms requiring assumption by
Purchase or Parent.

            There are no  actions or claims  existing  or  pending  (other  than
routine claims for benefits) to which Seller has received notice or, to Seller's
knowledge,  threatened  with  respect to any  Compensation  or Benefit Plan that
could have a material  effect on Seller's  ability to consummate the transaction
or the  Assets,  and  neither  Seller  nor any other  ERISA  Affiliate  has been
notified of any audit or  investigation of a Compensation or Benefit Plan by any
governmental entity.  "ERISA Affiliate" means any entity, trade or business that
would be  treated  as under  common  control  with  Seller  or as a member  of a
controlled  group  including any Seller within the meaning of Section 414 of the
U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Code  (the  "Code")  or  Section  4001 of the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act as from time to time amended ("ERISA").

            No event has occurred  and no  condition  exists with respect to any
"multi-employer  plan" (as  defined in ERISA  Section  3(37)) that Seller or any
ERISA  Affiliate has ever had an obligation to contribute  to, that could result
in the  imposition of a Lien or any other claim against any of the Assets of the
Business or for which  Purchaser or Parent could have any  liability as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            Seller has paid and discharged promptly when due all liabilities and
obligations  arising  under ERISA or the Code of a character  which if unpaid or
unperformed

could result in the  imposition  of a Lien or any other claim against any of the
Assets of the Business or for which Purchaser or Parent could have any liability
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            3.9         Litigation.  Except  as  disclosed  in any  registration
statement,  report,  proxy  statement or  information  statement  (including all
annexes,  supplements,  restatements and amendments  thereto) prepared by Seller
since January 28, 2000, and filed with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission
(the  "SEC")  (collectively,  including  any  such  reports  filed  with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof,  the "Seller  Reports") or except as set forth on
Schedule 3.9 annexed  hereto,  there is no legal action,  suit,  arbitration  or
other legal, administrative or governmental investigation, inquiry or proceeding
(whether federal,  state,  local or foreign) pending or, to Seller's  knowledge,
threatened in writing against or affecting the Business or the Assets except for
those that are not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Seller Reports filed prior
to the date hereof or except as set forth on such Schedule 3.9, Seller is not in
default  with  respect  to  any  order,  writ,  judgment,   injunction,  decree,
determination  or  award  of  any  court  or  of  any  governmental   agency  or
instrumentality  (whether federal,  state, local or foreign). The Seller Reports
disclose  that the SEC and Nasdaq have  undertaken an  investigation  of certain
acts or omissions pertaining to Seller and certain former officers and directors
of  Seller  (the  "SEC   Investigation").   To  Seller's   knowledge,   the  SEC
Investigation  has  not  involved  the  Business  in any  respect.  To  Seller's
knowledge,  the  subject  matter of the SEC  Investigation  relates to  Seller's
online business and does not relate to the Business in any respect.

            3.10        Taxes.

                        3.10.1  Seller:  (1) has or will have filed (taking into

respects;  (2) except for Taxes  properly  and  adequately  reserved  for on its

amounts  owing to any employee,  creditor or other Person all Taxes  relating to
the Business or the Assets  required by  applicable  laws to be withheld and has

extent due and payable, except where the failure to file such Tax Returns or pay
or withhold  such Taxes or the  failure of such Tax  Returns to be complete  and
accurate  in all  material  respects  would not be  reasonably  likely to have a

                        3.10.3 No  deficiencies  for any Taxes  relating  to the
Business have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Seller, which have not
been  fully  paid  or  adequately  provided  for  in the  appropriate  financial

                        3.10.4 No waivers or comparable  consents of the time to
assess any Taxes  relating  to the  Business  are  outstanding,  and no power of
attorney granted by Seller with respect to any Taxes relating to the Business is
currently in force.

            As used in this  Agreement,  (i) the  term  "Tax"  (including,  with
correlative  meaning,  the terms "Taxes", and "Taxable") shall mean all federal,
state, local and foreign income, profits,  premium,  franchise,  gross receipts,
environmental,  customs duty, capital stock,  severance,  stamp, payroll, sales,
employment,  unemployment,   disability,  use,  property,  withholding,  excise,
production,  value  added,  occupancy  and other Taxes,  duties or  governmental
levies of any nature  whatsoever,  together  with all  interest,  penalties  and
additions  imposed  with  respect to such amounts and any interest in respect of
such penalties and  additions,  and (ii) the term "Tax Return" means any return,
declaration,  report, claim for refund, information return or statement relating
to Taxes,  including  any schedule or  attachment  thereto,  and  including  any
amendment  thereof,  to be filed (whether on a mandatory or elective basis) with
any governmental authority.

            3.11        No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) to the extent set
forth or provided for in the Financial Statements,  (b) as set forth on Schedule
3.11 annexed  hereto or (c) for current  liabilities  incurred since the Balance
Sheet  Date in the  usual  and  ordinary  course  of  business  (none of  which,
individually  or in the aggregate,  are material to the Assets or the Business),
the  Business  has no  debts,  liabilities  or  obligations  of the  type  to be
disclosed on a financial  statement prepared in accordance with GAAP or in notes
thereto that, individually or in the aggregate,  has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the Assumed Liabilities have arisen in
the ordinary course of business of the Business.

other approvals of governmental bodies,  agencies and instrumentalities  thereof
necessary  to conduct  the  Business as  currently  conducted  (the  "Permits").
Schedule  3.12  annexed  hereto  sets  forth a list  of all  such  Permits.  The
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement will not result
in the  revocation,  suspension  or  limitation  of any  material  Permit and no
material  Permit will require the consent of its issuing  authority  to, or as a
result of, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

            3.13        Consents. All consents,  authorizations and approvals of
any  court,  governmental  body or  agency  or  instrumentality  thereof  or any
arbitrator or any other Person necessary to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement

contains a true and complete list of all material Contracts (other than purchase
orders from  advertisers)  relating  primarily  to the  Business  (collectively,
"Material  Contracts")  to  which  Seller  is a party or by  which  Seller,  the
Business or the Assets are bound or affected. For purposes of this Section 3.14,

federal,  state or local statute,  law,  rule,  regulation,  ordinance,  permit,
order,  decree  of,  or  other  lawful  obligation  imposed  by,  any  court  or
governmental  authority  or  instrumentality.  Except  in  each  case as is not,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect,  Seller  has  made  all  required  registrations  and  filings  with all
applicable material federal,  state and local government authorities relating to
the Business as  currently  conducted.  Seller has not  received  notice nor has
knowledge of any violation of any applicable zoning regulation, zoning ordinance
or land use law or regulation (including setback  requirements)  relating to the
Business or any real property owned, operated or leased by Seller.

any change in  accounting  methods,  principles  or  practices  affecting in any

(5%) made in accordance with past practices;

                        3.16.9  there  has  been  no  execution,   amendment  or

Business) is a party or by which it may be bound;

                        3.16.11 no  governmental  authority  or agency has taken
any position materially adverse to any aspect of the Business.

            3.17        Customers.  Schedule  3.17  annexed  hereto  contains  a
complete and accurate  list setting  forth,  for the twelve  months prior to the
Balance Sheet Date,  the top fifteen (15)  customers of the Business (the "Major
Customers"),  the total dollar  amount of business  transacted  with each of the
Major  Customers  during such  period,  and,  if  applicable,  the reasons  such

hereto, the Seller has not been notified that any of the Major Customers intends
to terminate or change  significantly  its relationship  with the Business on or
after the Closing Date.

            3.18        Affiliations.  Except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  3.18
annexed hereto or in the Seller Reports filed prior to the date hereof,  none of

any Assets are bound or affected.

            3.19        Brokers  and  Finders.  Neither  Seller  nor  any of its
officers,  directors or employees  has employed any broker or finder or incurred
any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated in this Agreement,  except
that Seller has employed,  and incurred a fee to, Allen & Company  Incorporated.

other  person  who may have had access to such trade  secrets.  All of  Seller's
material  trade secrets  pertaining to the Business  have been  communicated  to

                                   ARTICLE IV.
             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER AND PARENT
             ------------------------------------------------------

            Each of  Purchaser  and Parent  hereby  represents  and  warrants to
Seller as follows:

            4.1         Organization  and Good  Standing.  Each of Purchaser and
Parent  (a) is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly  existing  and in  good
standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, (b) has full corporate power
and authority to own and operate its  properties  and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and (c) is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation  in each  jurisdiction  where  the  ownership  or  operation  of its
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,  except where
the  failure  to be so  qualified,  when  taken  together  with all  other  such
failures, is not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably likely to have a
material  adverse  effect on the business,  liabilities,  properties,  assets or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent.

            4.2         Absence of Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Purchaser or Parent,  the compliance by Purchaser or Parent
with the terms and  conditions  hereof nor the  consummation  by  Purchaser  and
Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with any of the
terms,  conditions or provisions of the certificate of incorporation,  bylaws or
other charter documents of Purchaser or Parent, (b) violate any provision of, or
require any consent,  authorization or approval under, any law or


                                      -20-

with,  result in a breach or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) a default  under,  or  accelerate  or permit  the  acceleration  of the
performance  required  by, or require  any  consent,  authorization  or approval
(other  than those  required  to be  obtained  which have been,  or prior to the
Closing will be, duly obtained by Purchaser) under, any term or provision of any
Lien, lease,  agreement or instrument to which Purchaser or Parent is a party or
by which Purchaser or Parent or the assets of Purchaser or Parent are bound, (d)
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the assets of Purchaser or Parent
or (e) give to others any rights or  interests  (including  rights of  purchase,
termination  or  cancellation)   under  any  such  Lien,  lease,   agreement  or
instrument,  except in the case of (b),  (c), (d) or (e) above,  for a conflict,
breach, default or acceleration that does not render consummation of the Closing
illegal and is not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on the business,  liabilities,  properties,  assets or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent.

            4.3         Power and Authority.

                        (a)  Each of  Purchaser  and  Parent  has all  requisite

order to  execute,  deliver and carry out all the terms and  provisions  of this
Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each of Purchaser
and  Parent has  taken,  or caused to have been  taken,  all  necessary  action,
corporate or otherwise,  to authorize  Purchaser's and Parent's, as the case may
be,  execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Consummation  of  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby does not require the approval of the stockholders of Parent
or Purchaser.

                        (b) This Agreement  constitutes,  and upon the execution
and delivery by each of Purchaser and Parent of the other  agreements  among the
parties referred to herein and each instrument and certificate delivered by each
of Purchaser  and Parent  pursuant  hereto,  such  agreements,  instruments  and
certificates  shall  constitute,  the legal,  valid and binding  obligations  of
Purchaser  or Parent,  as the case may be,  enforceable  against  Purchaser  and
Parent in accordance with their respective terms,  subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception.

            4.4         Consents.  All necessary  consents,  authorizations  and
approvals of any court,  governmental body or agency or instrumentality  thereof
or any  arbitrator  or any other  Person  relating  to  Purchaser's  or Parent's
consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
obtained.

            4.5         Brokers and Finders. None of Purchaser, Parent or any of
their  respective  officers,  directors or employees  has employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders'
fees in connection with this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated in this
Agreement.  Each  of  Purchaser


                                      -21-

and Parent acknowledges that Seller has no obligation to pay any portion of such

respect to such fee.


                                   ARTICLE V.
                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES.
                            -------------------------

            5.1         Online  Services.  It is understood that no provision in
this  Agreement  is  intended  to  preclude  Seller,  Parent or  Purchaser  from
providing online services either prior or subsequent to the Closing.

            5.2         Covenant Against Competition.

                        5.2.1  Prohibited  Acts.  Seller hereby agrees that from
and after the Closing Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, whether through
an affiliated company or otherwise,  in any capacity  whatsoever,  do any of the
following:

                               (a) At any time during the first twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing, engage, directly or indirectly,  in any business which
(i) operates an offline list marketing services  business,  consisting of one or
more of list management  services,  database enhancement  services,  list rental
fulfillment  services,  modeling  and  analytical  services or list  maintenance
hygiene services (but expressly excluding email list management, email brokerage
and all other online  services)  and (ii) does  business  anywhere in the United
States.

                               (b) Except as  required by law or pursuant to the
SEC  Investigation,  at any time  disclose  or furnish to any third  parties any
confidential  information  concerning the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and/or
the Business,  including  without  limitation  any trade  secrets,  the names of
customers or suppliers,  the methods of operations,  pricing,  the techniques of
distribution or any other similar information;

                               (c) For a  period  of two  (2)  years  after  the
Closing,  cause or induce any person  employed  by the  Business  at any time to
leave his or her employment with the Business except with the written consent of
Purchaser; or

                               (d) For a  period  of two  (2)  years  after  the
Closing,  use the name "MaxDirect" or any name substantially  equivalent thereto
(it  being  understood  that  the  use of the  names  "MaxWorldwide,"  "Max " or
"MaxOnline" shall not violate this Section 5.2.1(d)).

                        5.2.2  Damages for Breach.  Seller  hereby  acknowledges
that the  covenants  contained  in  Section  5.2.1  are of the  essence  of this
Agreement and that if it violates any such covenants,  monetary damages would be
inadequate.  Seller  hereby  agrees  that in the  event of any  such  violation,
Purchaser  and Parent  shall be entitled to  injunctive


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


relief,  as a matter of right,  and to all other  remedies  and  rights to which
Purchaser  and  Parent  may be  entitled  at law or in  equity  and  under  this
Agreement.

                        5.2.3  Other  Matters.  Seller  agrees  that each of the
provisions of this Section 5.2, including without limitation the period of time,
geographical area and types and scope of the restrictions on Seller's activities
specified  herein,  are intended to be and shall be  divisible.  Seller  further
acknowledges the  reasonableness  of these provisions as an integral part of the
terms of this  Agreement.  If any provision of this Section 5.2  (including  any
sentence,  clause  or part  thereof)  shall  be  adjudicated  to be  invalid  or
unenforceable,  such provision  shall be deemed amended to delete  therefrom the
portion thus adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable,  such deletion to apply
only  with  respect  to the  operation  of  such  provision  in  the  particular
jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. In addition,  if any particular
provision  contained  in this  Section  5.2 shall  for any  reason be held to be
excessively broad as to duration,  geographical  scope,  activity or subject, it
shall  be  construed  by  limiting  and  reducing  such  provision  as  to  such
characteristic  so that the  provision  is  enforceable  to the  fullest  extent
compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.

            5.3         Employees.

                        5.3.1  Purchaser or Parent shall have extended offers to
all  of  Seller's  employees  of  the  Business  (the  "Potentially  Transferred
Employees"), on the terms and conditions set forth below, of employment and none
of such offers shall be withdrawn prior to the Closing. Each offer of employment
to the Potentially  Transferred  Employees shall be for a substantially  similar
position as such Potentially Transferred Employees held immediately prior to the
Closing,  for employment on an "at-will"  basis,  and for at least the same base
salary or regular wage and target bonus and commissions,  if applicable, as such
Potentially  Transferred  Employees  received  immediately prior to the Closing;
provided,  however,  that on and after the first anniversary of the Closing such
base salary or regular wage,  position and all other  compensation  and benefits
shall be otherwise  determined in the sole discretion of the Purchaser or Parent
or any of their respective successors or assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subject to  Section  5.3.4,  Purchaser  shall  have the right to  terminate  the
services  of any  such  Potentially  Transferred  Employee  at any  time  in its
discretion.  Purchaser  or  Parent  may,  in  compliance  with  applicable  law,
interview and conduct background  investigations with respect to all Potentially
Transferred Employees.  Potentially Transferred Employees who accept Purchaser's
or Parent's offer of employment and commence such  employment with the Purchaser
or Parent,  as the case may be, upon the Closing are heretofore and  hereinafter
collectively  referred  to as  the  "Transferred  Employees."  Effective  on the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and hereby does,  release all Transferred  Employees
from any of their  post-Closing  obligations  under any employment,  non-compete
and/or confidentiality  agreement previously entered into between the Seller and
such  Transferred  Employees  solely  to the  extent  necessary  to  allow  such
Transferred  Employees to serve  Purchaser  or Parent,  or their  successors  or
assigns; provided,  however, that Seller is not hereby releasing any Transferred
Employee from any employment,  non-


                                      -23-
<PAGE>


compete or confidentiality agreement as such agreement relates to any portion of
Seller's or its affiliates' businesses other than the Business.

                        5.3.2 Each of Purchaser and Parent shall  recognize each
of the Transferred Employees' service with Seller and Novus List Marketing prior
to the Closing as service with the  Purchaser or Parent,  as the case may be, in
connection with any pension plan,  401(k) savings plan or other employee benefit
plans  (including  vacations and holidays)  maintained and made available by the
Purchaser  or Parent,  as the case may be,  following  the Closing in which such
Transferred  Employees  elect to participate  solely for purposes of vesting and
eligibility (but excluding benefit accruals other than for vacation and sick day
accruals).  Each of Purchaser  and Parent  shall cause any welfare  benefit plan
that such  Transferred  Employees  may be eligible to  participate  in after the
Closing maintained by the Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, to the extent
not  prohibited  by  applicable   laws,  to  waive  any  preexisting   condition
limitation,  exclusion or waiting  period for  Transferred  Employees  and their
dependents,  to the same extent such limitations,  exclusions or waiting periods
were satisfied,  covered or waived under similar  Seller's welfare benefit plans
prior to the Closing.  Each of Purchaser and Parent shall also recognize each of
the Transferred  Employees'  service with Seller prior to the Closing as service
with the Purchaser or Parent,  as the case may be, in  connection  with the paid
vacation policy maintained by Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be.

                        5.3.3   Seller   shall  take  all   reasonable   actions
(including, without limitation, amendment of Seller's 401(k) plan), necessary to
permit lump sum or eligible  rollover  distributions  to be made to  Transferred
Employees  of  their  account  balances  under  Seller's  401(k)  plan  within a
reasonable period of time following the Closing.

                        5.3.4 In the  event  that any  Transferred  Employee  is
dismissed by Parent or Purchaser without cause under circumstances in which such
Transferred  Employee  would be entitled  to receive  severance  under  Parent's
severance  plans or policies,  Parent shall cause such  Transferred  Employee to
receive  severance  under  Parent's  severance  plans  and  policies  as if such
Transferred  Employee had been retained by Parent from the date such Transferred
Employee commenced service with Seller, or if earlier, the date such Transferred
Employee  commenced  service  with Novus  List  Marketing.  Except as  otherwise
expressly provided herein and except for any probationary  periods applicable to
Parent's  employee  benefit  plans,  during the first  twelve  months  after the
Closing,  the Transferred  Employees in Purchaser's  employ shall be entitled to
participate in the same, or  substantially  the same,  employee benefit plans as
the employee benefit plans in which Parent's employees generally participate.

                        5.3.5  This  Section  5.3  confers  no legal  rights  or
responsibilities  upon any Person  other  than  Purchaser,  Parent  and  Seller.

            6.4         Limitations. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the

                        6.4.1  No claim  for  indemnification  shall be  brought

<PAGE>


                        6.4.3  No  claim  shall  be  made  for   indemnification
pursuant  to  Section  6.2.1 or 6.3.1  after the  expiration  of the  applicable
Survival Period.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,  neither
the  Indemnity  Basket nor the Indemnity Cap shall apply to any claim for Losses
relating to or arising from the  provisions of Section 1.2 or from the breach of
any other covenant in this Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, neither Seller, on one hand, nor Purchaser or Parent, on
the other hand,  shall have any  liability to indemnify the other for any Losses
resolved by the parties pursuant to Section 1.2.3.

            6.5         Procedures for  Third-Party  Claims.  In the case of any
claim for indemnification  arising from a claim of a third party, an indemnified
party  shall  give  written  notice,  within  twenty  (20) days  following  such
indemnified  party's receipt of such claims or demand, to the indemnifying party
of any claims or demand of which such indemnified  party has knowledge and as to
which it may request  indemnification  hereunder;  provided,  however,  that the
failure to provide  notice  within such twenty (20) day time period shall reduce
the  indemnification  obligations of the  indemnifying  party only to the extent
that the  indemnifying  party is prejudiced by such  failure.  The  indemnifying
party shall have the right to defend and to direct the defense  against any such
claims or demand,  in its name or in the name of the  indemnified  party, as the
case may be, at the expense of the indemnifying party, and with counsel selected
by the  indemnifying  party  unless  (i) such  claim or  demand  seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief against the indemnified  party, or (ii) the
indemnified  party shall have reasonably  concluded that (x) there is a conflict
of interest  between the  indemnified  party and the  indemnifying  party in the
conduct of the defense of such claim or demand or (y) the indemnified  party has
one or more defenses not available to the  indemnifying  party.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  the indemnified party shall, at the
expense of the indemnifying  party,  cooperate with the indemnifying  party, and
keep the  indemnifying  party  fully  informed,  in the defense of such claim or
demand. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of any claim or demand  with  counsel  employed  at its own  expense;  provided,
however,  that,  in the case of any claim or demand  described  in clause (i) or
(ii) of the second  preceding  sentence  or as to which the  indemnifying  party
shall not in fact have  employed  counsel to assume the defense of such claim or
demand,  the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of such counsel shall be at the
expense  of the  indemnifying  party.  The  indemnifying  party  shall  have  no
indemnification obligations with respect to any such claim or demand which shall
be settled by the  indemnified  party without the prior  written  consent of the
indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            6.6         Fees and  Expenses.  In the  event  that any  claim  for
indemnification  hereunder  results in litigation  that is not resolved prior to
the rendering of a judgment thereunder,  the successful party in such litigation
shall  be  entitled  to  receive  from  the  other  party  in  such   litigation
compensation  for all reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses  incurred by such
successful party in connection with such litigation.

            6.7         Exclusive  Remedy.  Except  for  fraud and  except  with
respect to the  provisions  of Section 1.2, and subject to any party's right for
equitable  relief,  the  indemnification  provisions  of this  Article  VI shall
constitute  the sole and exclusive  remedy of the parties  hereto for any Losses
arising  under  Sections  6.2.1 and 6.3.1,  and the parties each waive any other
remedy which they or any other Person entitled to indemnification  hereunder may
have at Law or otherwise with respect to such Losses.

            6.8         Definitions.  For  purposes of this Article XI, the term
"Qualified  Representation  and Warranty" means any  representation  or warranty
that is qualified by concepts of materiality or Material  Adverse Effect and the
term  "Unqualified  Representation  and Warranty"  means any  representation  or
warranty that is not so qualified.

with respect to any other  party's  purposes for entering  into this  Agreement;

specifically provided in this Agreement;  and (c) may be executed in two or more
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
counterparts shall together constitute a single agreement.

      7.16      Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each party hereto ("Party") hereby waives
to the fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect to any suit,  action or other  proceeding  directly  or
indirectly  arising out of, under or in  connection  with this  Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby. Each Party (a) certifies that no representative
of any other Party has  represented,  expressly  or  otherwise,  that such other
Party would not, in the event of any suit, action or other  proceeding,  seek to
enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties
have been  induced to enter into this  Agreement,  by, among other  things,  the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 7.16.

      7.17      Consent to Jurisdiction.  Each Party irrevocably  submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of New York and
any New  York  state  court,  for the  purposes  of any  suit,  action  or other
proceeding  arising out of this Agreement or any agreement  ancillary  hereto or
any transaction  contemplated hereby or thereby.  Each party further agrees that
service of any process,  summons,  notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such Party's  respective  address set forth herein shall be effective service of
process,  summons or notice for any such suit, action or proceeding  pursuant to
this Section.  Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally  waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any action,  suit or proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
