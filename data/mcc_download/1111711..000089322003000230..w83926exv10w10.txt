Patrick J. Mulchay

Dear Pat:

This Letter Agreement confirms our decision concerning your employment status.
As we discussed, you will retire from your employment with NiSource Corporate
Services Company. If you sign this Letter Agreement, it will constitute the
mutual agreement between you and NiSource Corporate Services Company ("the
Company" which, as used herein shall mean NiSource Inc. or any of its affiliates
or subsidiaries, including NiSource Corporate Services Company; except in
Exhibit 1, references to "NiSource" shall mean exclusively NiSource Inc.)
regarding the terms of your retirement.

      1.    Employment Status

            Unless you are discharged for cause (which would include but not be
            limited to a breach of Paragraph 12 of this Letter Agreement), you
            will continue as an active employee of the Company through January
            31, 2003, for all purposes, including participation in the 2002
            NiSource Inc. ("NiSource") bonus plan, all Company employee benefit
            plans and for purposes of vesting (a) any restricted stock in
            NiSource owned by you and (b) any NiSource stock options owned by
            you. Thereafter, you will retire from the Company with the benefits
            set forth herein provided that you execute a release at that time in
            the form attached as Exhibit 1 hereto.

      2.    Business Transition

            You will not be required to report to your Company office or perform
            your management duties after August 28, 2002 ("Separation Date")
            although you may be required to render services as requested to
            ensure a smooth business transition between August 28 and January
            31, 2003. After your Separation Date, you agree to cooperate
            whenever needed in the preparation for and/or defense of any
            litigation in which the Company is involved. If your assistance is
            required by the Company in such matters following the end of your
            consulting arrangement, you will be paid $1,000 per day and
            reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses.
<PAGE>
      3.    Consulting Arrangement

            Between February 1, 2003 and March 31, 2004, you agree to provide
            consulting services to the Company as requested by the CEO and COO
            of the Company. You will be paid a fee of $15,000.00 per month for
            said consulting services, provided that your services are not
            terminated prior to March 31, 2004 for cause or due to death or
            disability. These services will include but not be limited to
            assistance with the establishment of an RTO, review of strategic
            options and general matters related to electric operations. You will
            provide these services as and you agreed that you will be an
            independent contractor and you will not be eligible to participate
            in the Company benefit plans except as specifically provided for in
            this Letter Agreement. During the consulting arrangement, you will
            be reimbursed for appropriately documented and approved business
            expenses and you will be provided comparable office space. In
            addition, at the termination of your consulting arrangement, you
            will receive a lump sum payment of $230,000.

      4.    Change In Control

            You acknowledge that you are not currently owed any benefits under
            your Change in Control and Termination Agreement ("CIC") dated
            September 1, 1997. Nonetheless, as additional consideration for your
            execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that, if

            (a)   an acquisition of all the outstanding stock of NiSource (**)
                  is closed on or before March 31, 2006, or

            (b)   (**)

            then you will receive the benefits set forth in the CIC less the
            amounts paid to you as a result of the consulting agreement provided
            in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement; and provided that in lieu of any
            welfare benefits set forth by the terms of the CIC to which you may
            be entitled under the CIC and which you are not already receiving,
            you will receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of
            such welfare benefits calculated as of the date of closing of such
            acquisition. You will not receive any payments under the CIC in the
            event all of the outstanding stock of NiSource is acquired under
            circumstances not specifically described in the previous sentence.

            In the event the CIC is triggered pursuant to this paragraph, you
            agree that Section 3(a)(2) of the CIC will be based on the 2002
            incentive bonus compensation plan and that Sections 3(a) (3), (4),
            (5) and (6) of the CIC will not apply.

            for Social Security and federal, state and local taxes, as well as
            deductions for any contributory benefit plans in which you elect to
            continue participation. Your vacation accrual through December 31,
            2002 is 356 hours, with an additional 20 hours to be earned in

            You will receive the greater of your threshold or actual bonus
            earned under the 2002 NiSource Inc. bonus plan.

      9.    Indemnification

            You will be entitled to indemnification by the Company to the same
