Coors Company, a Colorado corporation (the "Company"), previously established the Adolph Coors Company Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of February&nbsp;1,
1998. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective as of February&nbsp;16, 2001, and is hereby further amended and restated in its entirety, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2002.
The Plan is intended to provide a mechanism whereby certain of the highly compensated and select management employees of the Company and those affiliates that adopt the Plan may defer compensation and
have such amounts, together with credited earnings, if applicable, paid out upon the participant's retirement, death, disability or other termination of service with the Company or affiliate and upon
certain other specified events. The Company intends that the Plan shall not be treated as a "funded" plan for purposes of either the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). </FONT></P>

last address filed with the Company, or if no address is filed with the Company, then at his last address as shown on the Company's records, will be binding on the Participant and his spouse for all
purposes of the Plan. The Company shall not be required to search for or locate a Participant or his spouse. If the Committee notifies a Participant (or Beneficiary) that he is entitled to a
distribution and also notifies him of the provisions of this section, and the individual fails to claim his benefits under this Plan or make his address known to the Committee within five calendar
years after the notification, the benefits under the Plan of such individual shall be forfeited as of the end of the Plan Year coincident with or following the five year waiting period. If the
individual should later make a claim for his forfeited benefit, the Company shall cause the amount of the forfeited benefit to be distributed to the individual, either through a direct payment by the
