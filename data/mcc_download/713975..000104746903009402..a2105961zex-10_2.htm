continuation of benefits if he executes a General Release in favor of Corporation, Bank and their subsidiaries and affiliates. However, in the event the payments described herein, when added to all
other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf of the Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Code Section&nbsp;4999,

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>21.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B>Arbitration.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporation and Executive recognize that in the event a dispute should arise between them concerning the
interpretation or implementation of this Agreement (except for any enforcement sought with respect to Sections 9, 10, 11, or 12, which may be litigated in court), lengthy and expensive litigation will
not afford a practical resolution of the issues within a reasonable period of time. Consequently, each party agrees that all disputes, disagreements and questions of interpretation concerning this
Agreement are to be submitted for resolution, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the American Arbitration Association (the "Association") in accordance with the Association's National Rules for the
Resolution of Employment Disputes or other applicable rules then in effect ("Rules"). Corporation or Executive may initiate an arbitration proceeding at any time by giving notice to the other in
accordance with the Rules. Corporation and Executive may, as a matter or right, mutually agree on the appointment of a particular arbitrator from the Association's pool. The arbitrator shall not be
bound by the rules of evidence and procedure of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but shall be bound by the substantive law applicable to this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator,
absent fraud, duress, incompetence or gross and obvious error of fact, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in courts of proper jurisdiction. Following written notice
of a request for arbitration, Corporation, Bank and Executive shall be entitled to an injunction restraining all further proceedings in any pending or subsequently filed litigation concerning this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein or any enforcement sought with respect to Sections 9, 10, 11, or 12.
