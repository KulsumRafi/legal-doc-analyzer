                  1.       Title to Warrant. Prior to the Termination Date and
subject to compliance with applicable laws, this Warrant and all rights
hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, at the office or agency of the
Company by the Holder in person or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender
of this Warrant together with the Assignment Form annexed hereto properly
endorsed.

                  2.       Authorization of Shares. The Company covenants that
all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue
thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously
with such issue).

                  3.       Exercise of Warrant.

                                    (a)      Exercise of the purchase rights
         represented by this Warrant may be made at any time or times on or
         after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date
         by delivery to the Company of a duly executed facsimile copy of the
         Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto (or such other office or agency
         of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the
         registered Holder at the address of such Holder appearing on the books
         of the Company); provided, however, within 5 Trading Days of the date
         said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Holder shall
         have surrendered this Warrant to the Company and the Company shall have
         received payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby
         purchased by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn on a United States
         bank. Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be delivered to
         the Holder within the earlier of (i) 5 Trading Days after the date on
         which the Notice of Exercise shall have been delivered by facsimile
         copy or (ii) 3 Trading Days from the delivery to the Company of the
         Notice of Exercise Form by facsimile copy, surrender of this Warrant
         and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth above
         ("Warrant Share Delivery Date"); provided, however, in the event the
         Warrant is not surrendered or the aggregate Exercise Price is not
         received by the Company within 5 Trading Days after the date on which
         the Notice of Exercise shall be delivered by facsimile copy, the
         Warrant Share Delivery Date shall be extended to the extent such 5
         Trading Day period is exceeded. This Warrant shall be deemed to have
         been exercised on the date the Notice of Exercise is delivered to the
         Company by facsimile copy. The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have
         been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named
         therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such
         shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised
         by payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required
         to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 5 prior to the
         issuance of such shares, have been paid. If the Company fails to
         deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the
         Warrant Shares pursuant to this Section 3(a) by the Warrant Share
         Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such
         exercise. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if
         the Company fails to deliver to the Holder a certificate or
         certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise by
         the


                                        2
<PAGE>

         second Trading Day after the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after
         such Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or
         otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale
         by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated
         receiving upon such exercise (a "Buy-In"), then the Company shall (1)
         pay in cash to the Holder the amount by which (x) the Holder's total
         purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares
         of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by
         multiplying (A) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was
         required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at
         issue times (B) the closing bid price of the Common Stock at the time
         of the obligation giving rise to such purchase obligation, and (2) at
         the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant
         and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not
         honored or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
         that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its
         exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder
         purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to
         cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of
         Common Stock with a market price on the date of exercise totaled
         $10,000, under clause (1) of the immediately preceding sentence the
         Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall
         provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to
         the Holder in respect of the Buy-In. Nothing herein shall limit a
         Holder's right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder,
         at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
         performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company's
         failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common
         Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms
         hereof.

                                    (b)      If this Warrant shall have been
         exercised in part, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the
         certificate or certificates representing Warrant Shares, deliver to
         Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the
         unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new
         Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.

                                    (c)      Notwithstanding anything herein to
         the contrary, in no event shall the Holder be permitted to exercise
         this Warrant for Warrant Shares to the extent that (i) the number of
         shares of Common Stock owned by such Holder (other than Warrant Shares
         issuable upon exercise of this Warrant) plus (ii) the number of Warrant
         Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, would be equal to or
         exceed 4.9999% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and
         outstanding, including shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
         held by such Holder after application of this Section 3(c). As used
         herein, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with
         Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. To the extent that the limitation
         contained in this Section 3(c) applies, the determination of whether
         this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by
         the Holder) and of which a portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall
         be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a
         Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be such Holder's determination of
         whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities
         owned by such Holder) and of which portion of this Warrant is
         exercisable, in each case subject to such aggregate percentage
         limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or
         confirm the accuracy of such


                                        3
<PAGE>

         determination. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to restrict the
         right of a Holder to exercise this Warrant into Warrant Shares at such
         time as such exercise will not violate the provisions of this Section
         3(c). The provisions of this Section 3(c) may be waived by the Holder
         upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days' prior
         notice to the Company, and the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall
         continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as
         determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of
         waiver). No exercise of this Warrant in violation of this Section 3(c)
         but otherwise in accordance with this Warrant shall affect the status
         of the Warrant Shares as validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable.

                                    (d)      If after one year if there is no
         effective Registration Statement registering the Warrant Shares, this
         Warrant may also be exercised by means of a "cashless exercise" in
         which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the
         number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
         [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:

                           (A)      = the average of the high and low trading
                                    prices per share of Common Stock on the
                                    Trading Day preceding the date of such
                                    election;

                           (B)      = the Exercise Price of the Warrants; and

                           (X)      = the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon
                                    exercise of the Warrants in accordance with
                                    the terms of this Warrant.

                                    (e)      Until the Company obtains
         Shareholder Approval (as defined in Section 4.16 of the Purchase
         Agreement), the Holder's right to exercise this Warrant shall be
         limited to the extent such exercise causes the issuance to exceed such
         Holder's (or its predecessor's) pro-rata portion of the Issuable
         Maximum (as defined in Section 4(a)(iii) of the Debenture). The
         Termination Date shall be extended for a number of Trading Days equal
         to the number of days the exercise of this Warrant is prohibited
         hereunder.


                                        4
<PAGE>

                  4.       No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional shares
or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of
this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be
entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment
in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
by the Exercise Price.

                  5.       Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance of certificates
for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such
certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and
such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or
names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that in the event
certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name
of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied
by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder; and the
Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to
reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.

                  6.       Closing of Books. The Company will not close its
stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant.

                  7.       Transfer, Division and Combination.


                           (a)      Subject to compliance with any applicable
         securities laws, transfer of this Warrant and all rights hereunder, in
         whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the Company to be
         maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this Warrant at the
         principal office of the Company, together with a written assignment of
         this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by
         the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any
         transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such
         surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and
         deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
         assignees and in the denomination or denominations specified in such
         instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant
         evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this
         Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. A Warrant, if properly assigned,
         may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares
         without having a new Warrant issued.

                           (b)      This Warrant may be divided or combined with
         other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
         Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and
         denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the
         Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section
         7(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or
         combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or
         Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or
         combined in accordance with such notice.

                           (c)      The Company shall prepare, issue and deliver
         at its own expense (other than transfer taxes) the new Warrant or
         Warrants under this Section 7.


                                        5
<PAGE>

                           (d)      The Company agrees to maintain, at its
         aforesaid office, books for the registration and the registration of
         transfer of the Warrants.

                  8.       No Rights as Shareholder until Exercise. Upon the
surrender of this Warrant and the payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (or by
means of a cashless exercise), the Warrant Shares so purchased shall be and be
deemed to be issued to such Holder as the record owner of such shares as of the
close of business on the later of the date of such surrender or payment. This
Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a
shareholder of the Company prior to such date.

                  9.       Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant.
The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant
or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss,
theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it
(which shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and
cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the Company
will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated
as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.

                  10.      Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or
appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right
required or granted herein shall be a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, then
such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
day not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

                  11.      Adjustments of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant
Shares.

                           (a)      Stock Splits, etc. The number and kind of
         securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the
         Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon
         the happening of any of the following. In case the Company shall (i)
         pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock or make a distribution in
         shares of Common Stock to holders of its outstanding Common Stock, (ii)
         subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number
         of shares, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
         smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or (iv) issue any shares of
         its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock, then the
         number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant
         immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder shall be
         entitled to receive the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other
         securities of the Company which it would have owned or have been
         entitled to receive had such Warrant been exercised in advance thereof.
         Upon each such adjustment of the kind and number of Warrant Shares or
         other securities of the Company which are purchasable hereunder, the
         Holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase the number of Warrant
         Shares or other securities resulting from such adjustment at an
         Exercise Price per Warrant Share or other security obtained by
         multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such
         adjustment by the number of Warrant Shares purchasable pursuant hereto
         immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing by the number of
         Warrant Shares or other securities of the Company resulting from such
         adjustment. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become
         effective immediately after the effective date of such event
         retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event.


                                        6
<PAGE>

                           (b)      Anti-Dilution Provisions. During the
         Exercise Period, the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares
         issuable hereunder and for which this Warrant is then exercisable
         pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall be subject to adjustment from time
         to time as provided in this Section 11(b). In the event that any
         adjustment of the Exercise Price as required herein results in a
         fraction of a cent, such Exercise Price shall be rounded up or down to
         the nearest cent.

                           (i)      Adjustment of Exercise Price. If and
                  whenever the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with
                  Section 8(b) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any
                  shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share of less
                  than the then the Exercise Price or for no consideration (such
                  lower price, the "Base Share Price" and such issuances
                  collectively, a "Dilutive Issuance"), then, the Exercise Price
                  shall be reduced to equal the Base Share Price, provided, that
                  for purposes hereof, all shares of Common Stock that are
                  issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of Capital
                  Share Equivalents shall be deemed outstanding immediately
                  after the issuance of such Common Stock. Such adjustment shall
                  be made whenever such shares of Common Stock or Capital Share
                  Equivalents are issued.

                           (ii)     Effect on Exercise Price of Certain Events.
                  For purposes of determining the adjusted Exercise Price under
                  Section 11(b) hereof, the following will be applicable:

                                    (A)      Issuance of Rights or Options. If
                           the Company in any manner issues or grants any
                           warrants, rights or options, whether or not
                           immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to
                           purchase Common Stock or other securities
                           exercisable, convertible into or exchangeable for
                           Common Stock ("Convertible Securities") (such
                           warrants, rights and options to purchase Common Stock
                           or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to
                           as "Options") and the price per share for which
                           Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such
                           Options is less than the Exercise Price ("Below Base
                           Price Options"), then the maximum total number of
                           shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
                           all such Below Base Price Options (assuming full
                           exercise, conversion or exchange of Convertible
                           Securities, if applicable) will, as of the date of
                           the issuance or grant of such Below Base Price
                           Options, be deemed to be outstanding and to have been
                           issued and sold by the Company for such price per
                           share. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
                           "price per share for which Common Stock is issuable
                           upon the exercise of such Below Base Price Options"
                           is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if
                           any, received or receivable by the Company as
                           consideration for the issuance or granting of all
                           such Below Base Price Options, plus the minimum
                           aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
                           payable to the Company upon the exercise of all such
                           Below Base Price Options, plus, in the case of
                           Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
                           such Below Base Price Options, the minimum aggregate
                           amount of additional consideration payable upon the
                           exercise, conversion or exchange thereof at the time
                           such Convertible Securities first become exercisable,
                           convertible or

                           exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of
                           shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
                           all such Below Base Price Options (assuming full
                           conversion of Convertible Securities, if applicable).
                           No further adjustment to the Exercise Price will be
                           made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock
                           upon the exercise of such Below Base Price Options or
                           upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
                           Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such
                           Below Base Price Options.

                                    (B)      Issuance of Convertible Securities.
                           If the Company in any manner issues or sells any
                           Convertible Securities, whether or not immediately
                           convertible (other than where the same are issuable
                           upon the exercise of Options) and the price per share
                           for which Common Stock is issuable upon such
                           exercise, conversion or exchange is less than the
                           Exercise Price, then the maximum total number of
                           shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
                           conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
                           Securities will, as of the date of the issuance of
                           such Convertible Securities, be deemed to be
                           outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the
                           Company for such price per share. For the purposes of
                           the preceding sentence, the "price per share for
                           which Common Stock is issuable upon such exercise,
                           conversion or exchange" is determined by dividing (i)
                           the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
                           the Company as consideration for the issuance or sale
                           of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
                           aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any,
                           payable to the Company upon the exercise, conversion
                           or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible
                           Securities first become exercisable, convertible or
                           exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of
                           shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
                           conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
                           Securities. No further adjustment to the Exercise
                           Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such
                           Common Stock upon exercise, conversion or exchange of
                           such Convertible Securities.

                                    (C)      Change in Option Price or
                           Conversion Rate. If there is a change at any time in
                           (i) the amount of additional consideration payable to
                           the Company upon the exercise of any Options; (ii)
                           the amount of additional consideration, if any,
                           payable to the Company upon the exercise, conversion
                           or exchange of any Convertible Securities; or (iii)
                           the rate at which any Convertible Securities are
                           convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (in
                           each such case, other than under or by reason of
                           provisions designed to protect against dilution), the
                           Exercise Price in effect at the time of such change
                           will be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would
                           have been in effect at such time had such Options or
                           Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for
                           such changed additional consideration or changed
                           conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time
                           initially granted, issued or sold.

                                    (D)      Calculation of Consideration
                           Received. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible
                           Securities are issued, granted or sold for cash, the
                           consideration received therefor for purposes of this
                           Warrant will be the amount received by the Company
                           therefor, before deduction of reasonable commissions,
                           underwriting discounts or allowances or other
                           reasonable expenses paid or incurred by the Company
                           in connection with such issuance, grant or sale. In
                           case any Common Stock, Options or Convertible
                           Securities are issued or sold for a consideration
                           part or all of which shall be other than cash, the
                           amount of the consideration other than cash received
                           by the Company will be the fair market value of such
                           consideration, except where such consideration
                           consists of securities, in which case the amount of
                           consideration received by the Company will be the
                           Market Price thereof as of the date of receipt. In
                           case any Common Stock, Options or Convertible
                           Securities are issued in connection with any merger
                           or consolidation in which the Company is the
                           surviving corporation, the amount of consideration
                           therefor will be deemed to be the fair market value
                           of such portion of the net assets and business of the
                           non-surviving corporation as is attributable to such
                           Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as
                           the case may be. The fair market value of any
                           consideration other than cash or securities will be
                           determined in good faith by an investment banker or
                           other appropriate expert of national reputation
                           selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to
                           the holder hereof, with the costs of such appraisal
                           to be borne by the Company.

                                    (E)      Exceptions to Adjustment of
                           Exercise Price. No adjustment to the Exercise Price
                           will be made upon the grant or exercise of any
                           Convertible Securities which may hereafter be granted
                           or exercised under any employee benefit plan of the
                           Company now existing or to be implemented in the
                           future, so long as the issuance of such Convertible
                           Securities is approved by a majority of the
                           non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the
                           Company or a majority of the members of a committee
                           of non-employee directors established for such
                           purpose.

                           (iii)    Minimum Adjustment of Exercise Price. No
                  adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made in an amount of
                  less than 1% of the Exercise Price in effect at the time such
                  adjustment is otherwise required to be made, but any such
                  lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made
                  at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment
                  which, together with any adjustments so carried forward, shall
                  amount to not less than 1% of such Exercise Price.

                  12.      Reorganization, Reclassification, Merger,
Consolidation or Disposition of Assets. In case the Company shall reorganize its
capital, reclassify its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another
corporation (where the Company is not the surviving corporation or where there
is a change in or distribution with respect to the Common Stock of the Company),


                                        9
<PAGE>

or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its property,
assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such
reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of
assets, shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation, or any
cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever
(including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or
in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation ("Other
Property"), are to be received by or distributed to the holders of Common Stock
of the Company, then the Holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, at
their option, (a) upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of Common
Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the
surviving corporation, and Other Property receivable upon or as a result of such
reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets
by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is
exercisable immediately prior to such event, or (b) only if the Company is not
the surviving corporation and the Closing Bid Price immediately prior to such
event is less than 110% of the Exercise Price, cash equal to the value of this
Warrant as determined in accordance with the Black-Sholes option pricing formula
which amount shall in no event exceed 150% of the product of the Exercise Price
and the number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder. In case of any such
reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of
assets, the successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the Company) shall
expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and
every covenant and condition of this Warrant to be performed and observed by the
Company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such
modifications as may be deemed appropriate (as determined in good faith by
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company) in order to provide for
adjustments of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable which shall
be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this
Section 12. For purposes of this Section 12, "common stock of the successor or
acquiring corporation" shall include stock of such corporation of any class
which is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock
of such corporation and which is not subject to redemption and shall also
include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which
are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or
upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and
any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. The
foregoing provisions of this Section 12 shall similarly apply to successive
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of
assets.

                  13.      Voluntary Adjustment by the Company. The Company may
at any time during the term of this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise
Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors of the Company.

                  14.      Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the number of Warrant
Shares or number or kind of securities or other property purchasable upon the
exercise of this Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided,
the Company shall promptly mail by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the Holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments setting forth
the number of Warrant Shares (and other securities or property) purchasable upon
the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price of such Warrant Shares (and
other securities or property) after such adjustment, setting forth a brief
statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the
computation by which such adjustment was made. Such notice,


                                       10
<PAGE>

in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive evidence of the
correctness of such adjustment.

                  15.      Notice of Corporate Action. If at any time:

                           (a)      the Company shall take a record of the
         holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to
         receive a dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for
         or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of
         any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other
         right, or

                           (b)      there shall be any capital reorganization of
         the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital
         stock of the Company or any consolidation or merger of the Company
         with, or any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
         substantially all the property, assets or business of the Company to,
         another corporation or,

                           (c)      there shall be a voluntary or involuntary
         dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company;

then, in any one or more of such cases, the Company shall give to Holder (i) at
least 20 days' prior written notice of the date on which a record date shall be
selected for such dividend, distribution or right or for determining rights to
vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, liquidation or winding up, and (ii)
in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation,
sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, at least 20
days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place. Such
notice in accordance with the foregoing clause also shall specify (i) the date
on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to any such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and
character thereof, and (ii) the date on which any such reorganization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the time, if any
such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to exchange their Warrant Shares for securities or other property
deliverable upon such disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Each
such written notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed to Holder at the
last address of Holder appearing on the books of the Company and delivered in
accordance with Section 17(d).

                  16.      Authorized Shares. The Company covenants that during
the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and
unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance
of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this
Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall
constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of
executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for
the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure
that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of
any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Principal Market
upon which the Common Stock may be listed.


                                       11
<PAGE>

         The Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance
or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in
good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder
against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company will (a) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the
amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in
par value, (b) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order
that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable
Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (c) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents
from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary
to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant.

         Before taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the
number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions
thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory
body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.

                  17.      Miscellaneous.

                           (a)      Jurisdiction. This Warrant shall constitute
         a contract under the laws of New York, without regard to its conflict
         of law, principles or rules.

                           (b)      Restrictions. The Holder acknowledges that
         the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not
         registered, will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and
         federal securities laws.

                           (c)      Nonwaiver and Expenses. No course of dealing
         or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of
         Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice
         Holder's rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding all rights
         hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully
         and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which
         results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to
         Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and
         expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees,
         including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by Holder in
         collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing
         any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.

                           (d)      Notices. Any notice, request or other
         document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder
         by the Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice
         provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

                           (e)      Limitation of Liability. No provision
         hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by Holder to purchase
         Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges
         of Holder, shall give rise to any liability of Holder for the


                                       12

         purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company,
         whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by creditors of
         the Company.

                           (f)      Remedies. Holder, in addition to being
         entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of
         damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under
         this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be
         adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it
         of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive the
         defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
         would be adequate.

                           (g)      Successors and Assigns. Subject to
         applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations
         evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
         successors of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of
         Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the
         benefit of all Holders from time to time of this Warrant and shall be
         enforceable by any such Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.

                           (h)      Amendment. This Warrant may be modified or
         amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the
         Company and the Holder.

                           (i)      Severability. Wherever possible, each
         provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
         effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this
         Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such
         provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
         invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or
         the remaining provisions of this Warrant.

                           (j)      Headings. The headings used in this Warrant
         are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any
         purpose, be deemed a part of this Warrant.

                   NOTICE OF EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK WARRANT
                    PURSUANT TO CASHLESS EXERCISE PROVISIONS




To: Viragen, Inc.

Aggregate Price of Warrant Before Exercise: $_______
Aggregate Price Being Exercised: $______
Exercise Price: $______ per share
Number of Shares of Common Stock to be Issued Under this Notice: ________
Remaining Aggregate Price (if any) After Issuance: $_______


Gentlemen:

         The undersigned, registered Holder of the Warrant delivered herewith,
hereby irrevocably exercises such Warrant for, and purchases thereunder, shares
of the Common Stock of Viragen, Inc., as provided below. Capitalized terms used
herein, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings given in the
Warrant. The portion of the Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant) to be
applied toward the purchase of Common Stock pursuant to this Notice of Exercise
is $_______, thereby leaving a remaining Exercise Price (if any) equal to
$________. Such exercise shall be pursuant to the cashless exercise provisions
of Section 3 of the Warrant; therefore, Holder makes no payment with this Notice
of Exercise. The number of shares to be issued pursuant to this exercise shall
be determined by reference to the formula in Section 3 of the Warrant which, by
reference to Section 3, requires the use of the high and low trading price of
the Company's Common Stock on the Trading Day preceding the date of such
election. The high and low trading price of the Company's Common Stock has been
determined by Holder to be $______ and $_________, respectively, which figure is
acceptable to Holder for calculations of the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Notice of Exercise. Holder requests that the
certificates for the purchased shares of Common Stock be issued in the name of
_________________________ and delivered to ____________________________________.
To the extent the foregoing exercise is for less than the full Aggregate Price
of the Warrant, a replacement Warrant representing the remainder of the
Aggregate Price (and otherwise of like form, tenor and effect) shall be
delivered to Holder along with the share certificate evidencing the Common Stock
issued in response to this Notice of Exercise.

                                    Date:

                                    NOTE


         The execution to the foregoing Notice of Exercise must exactly
correspond to the name of the Holder on the Warrant.
