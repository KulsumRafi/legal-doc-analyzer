         the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Notes
         and (ii) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all outstanding Letters of

         incur no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting upon any telephonic
         request for Loan purportedly made by a Responsible Official of
         Borrower, and Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative
         Agent from any loss, cost, expense or liability as a result of so
         acting.

         applicable conditions set forth in Article 8, all Advances shall be
         credited on that date in immediately available funds to the Designated
         Deposit Account.

                           (d) Unless the Requisite Lenders otherwise consent,

         outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, then on the last day of such

         Days before the first day of the applicable Eurodollar Period, the
         Administrative Agent shall confirm its determination of the applicable

         of manifest error) and promptly shall give notice of the same to
         Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopier (and if by
         telephone, promptly confirmed by telecopier).

         the continuation of a Default or Event of Default.

                           (e) Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender

                           (a) The Existing Letters of Credit described in
         Schedule 2.4 shall be Letters of Credit for all purposes under this
         Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time and
         from time to time from the Closing Date through the Revolving Loan
         Maturity Date, the Issuing Lender shall issue such Letters of Credit
         under the Commitment as Borrower may request by a Request for Letter of
         Credit; provided that (i) giving effect to all such Letters of Credit,
         the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the
         Revolving Notes plus (B) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all
         outstanding Letters of Credit, does not exceed the then applicable
         Commitment and (ii) the Aggregate Effective Amount under all
         outstanding Letters of Credit does not exceed $4,000,000. Each Letter
         of Credit shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuing
         Lender. Unless all the Lenders otherwise consent in a writing delivered
         to the Administrative Agent, the term of any Letter of Credit (other
         than any Existing Letters of Credit) shall not exceed one (1) year or
         extend one hundred eighty (180) days beyond the Revolving Loan Maturity
         Date.

                           (b) Each Request for Letter of Credit shall be
         submitted to the Issuing Lender, with a copy to the Administrative
         Agent, at least two (2) Banking Days prior to the date upon which the
         related Letter of Credit is proposed to be issued. The Administrative
         Agent shall promptly notify the Issuing Lender whether such Request for
         Letter of Credit, and the issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant
         thereto, conforms to the requirements of this Agreement. Upon issuance
         of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the
         Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
         notify the Lenders, of the amount and terms thereof.

                           (c) Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each
         Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a pro rata participation in
         such Letter of Credit from the Issuing Lender in an amount equal to
         that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment. Without limiting the
         scope and nature of each Lender's participation in any Letter of
         Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed
         by Borrower for any payment required to be made by the Issuing Lender
         under any Letter of Credit, each Lender shall, pro rata according to
         its Pro Rata Share, reimburse the Issuing Lender through the
         Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for the amount of such
         payment. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing
         Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
         the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event.
         Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount
         of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit
         together with interest as hereinafter provided.

                           (d) Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender
         through the Administrative Agent an amount equal to any payment made by
         the Issuing Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit within one (1)
         Banking Day after demand made by the Issuing Lender therefor, together
         with interest on such amount from the date of



                                      -28-
<PAGE>

         any payment made by the Issuing Lender at the rate applicable to Base
         Rate Loans for two (2) Banking Days and thereafter at the Default Rate.
         The principal amount of any such payment shall be used to reimburse the
         Issuing Lender for the payment made by it under the Letter of Credit
         and, to the extent that the Lenders have not reimbursed the Issuing
         Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(c), the interest amount of any such
         payment shall be for the account of the Issuing Lender. Each Lender
         that has reimbursed the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(c) for
         its Pro Rata Share of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under a
         Letter of Credit shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to
         the extent of such reimbursement, in the claim of the Issuing Lender
         against Borrower for reimbursement of principal and interest under this
         Section 2.4(d) and shall share, in accordance with that pro rata
         participation, in any principal payment made by Borrower with respect
         to such claim and in any interest payment made by Borrower (but only
         with respect to periods subsequent to the date such Lender reimbursed
         the Issuing Lender) with respect to such claim.

                           (e) Borrower may, pursuant to a Request for Loan,
         request that Advances be made pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to provide
         funds for the payment required by Section 2.4(d) and, for this purpose,
         the conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 shall not apply. The
         proceeds of such Advances shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender
         to reimburse it for the payment made by it under the Letter of Credit.

                           (f) If Borrower fails to make the payment required by
         Section 2.4(d) within the time period therein set forth, in lieu of the
         reimbursement to the Issuing Lender under Section 2.4(c) the Issuing
         Lender may (but is not required to), without notice to or the consent
         of Borrower, instruct the Administrative Agent to cause Advances to be
         made by the Lenders under the Commitment in an aggregate amount equal
         to the amount paid by the Issuing Lender with respect to that Letter of
         Credit and, for this purpose, the conditions precedent set forth in
         Article 8 shall not apply. The proceeds of such Advances shall be paid
         directly to the Issuing Lender to reimburse it for the payment made by
         it under the Letter of Credit.

                           (g) The issuance of any supplement, modification,
         amendment, renewal, or extension to or of any Letter of Credit shall be
         treated in all respects the same as the issuance of a new Letter of
         Credit.

                           (h) The obligation of Borrower to pay to the Issuing
         Lender the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any
         Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable,
         subject only to performance by the Issuing Lender of its obligations to
         Borrower under Uniform Commercial Code Section 5109. Without limiting
         the foregoing, Borrower's obligations shall not be affected by any of
         the following circumstances:

                                    (i) any lack of validity or enforceability
                  prior to its stated expiration date of the Letter of Credit,
                  this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto;

                                    (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any
                  consent to departure from the Letter of Credit, this
                  Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto, with the consent of Borrower;

                                    (iii) the existence of any claim, setoff,
                  defense, or other rights which Borrower may have at any time
                  against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent or any
                  Lender, any beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (or any
                  persons or entities for whom any such beneficiary may be
                  acting) or any other Person, whether in connection with the
                  Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or
                  instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transactions;

                                    (iv) any demand, statement, or any other
                  document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be
                  forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect or
                  any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect whatsoever so long as any such document appeared
                  substantially to comply with the terms of the Letter of
                  Credit;

                                    (v) payment by the Issuing Lender in good
                  faith under the Letter of Credit against presentation of a
                  draft or any accompanying document which does not strictly
                  comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, unless the
                  acceptance of such draft or other accompanying document
                  constituted gross negligence;

                                    (vi) the existence, character, quality,
                  quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of any
                  Property purported to be represented by documents presented in
                  connection with any Letter of Credit or any difference between
                  any such Property and the character, quality, quantity,
                  condition, or value of such Property as described in such
                  documents;

                  in documents presented in connection with any Letter of Credit
                  or the existence, nature and extent of any insurance relative
                  thereto;

                                    (viii) the solvency or financial
                  responsibility of any party issuing any documents in

                                    (ix) any failure or delay in notice of

                  message;

                                    (xi) any error, neglect or default of any

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

                                    (xii) any consequence arising from acts of
                  God, war, insurrection, civil unrest, disturbances, labor
                  disputes, emergency conditions or other causes beyond the
                  control of the Issuing Lender;

                                    (xiii) so long as the Issuing Lender in good
                  faith determines that the contract or document appears
                  substantially to comply with the terms of the Letter of
                  Credit, the form, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
                  contract or document referred to in any document submitted to
                  the Issuing Lender in connection with a Letter of Credit
                  unless the Issuing Lender's actions constituted gross
                  negligence; and

                                    (xiv) where the Issuing Lender has acted in
                  good faith and observed general banking usage, any other
                  circumstances whatsoever unless the Issuing Lender's actions
                  constituted gross negligence.

                           (i) The Issuing Lender shall be entitled to the
         protection accorded to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
         10.6, with all necessary changes.

                           (j) The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
         Credits, as published in its most current version by the International
         Chamber of Commerce, shall be deemed a part of this Section and shall
         apply to all Letters of Credit to the extent not inconsistent with
         applicable Law.

                  2.5 Voluntary Reduction of Commitment. Borrower shall have the
right, at any time and from time to time, without penalty or charge, upon at
least five (5) Banking Days' prior written notice by a Responsible Official of
Borrower to the Administrative Agent, voluntarily to reduce, permanently and
irrevocably, in aggregate principal amounts in an integral multiple of $500,000
but not less than $5,000,000, or to terminate, all or a portion of the then
undisbursed portion of the Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Lenders of any reduction or termination of the Commitment under this
Section.

                  2.6 Administrative Agent's Right to Assume Funds Available for
Advances. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender
no later than 10:00 a.m. on the Banking Day of the proposed funding by the
Administrative Agent of any Loan that such Lender does not intend to make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of the total amount
of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of the Loan and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
Borrower a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent has made funds
available to Borrower based on such assumption and such corresponding amount is
not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
Agent promptly shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall pay such corresponding
amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be
entitled to recover from such Lender interest on such corresponding amount in
respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available
by the



                                      -31-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent to Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the daily
Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from
its obligation to fulfill its share of the Commitments or to prejudice any
rights which the Administrative Agent or Borrower may have against any Lender as
a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  2.7 Collateral. The Obligations shall be secured by a first
priority (subject to Liens permitted by Section 6.9) perfected Lien on the
Collateral pursuant to the Security Agreement.

                  2.8 Annual Collateral Audits. The Collateral Agent, or its
agent, may conduct or obtain, at Borrower's expense (not to exceed $4,000 in the
aggregate for any such audit), annual audits of the Accounts and the Inventory,
Borrower's books and records, Borrower's accounting system and such other items
as the Collateral Agent may reasonably require. Borrower hereby acknowledges and
agrees that if the Administrative Agent is not satisfied with its review of the
results of any such audit, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in its
reasonable credit judgment, to reduce the advance rate for Eligible Accounts or
Eligible Inventory.

                           (c) Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Rate Loan
         shall be due and payable on the last day of the related Eurodollar

         Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i)
         the interest rate specified in Sections 3.1(b) or 3.1(c), whichever is
         applicable, plus (ii) two (2) percentage points.

                           (e) If not sooner paid, the principal Indebtedness
         evidenced by the Notes shall be payable as follows:

                  (A) the principal Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving
                  Notes plus (B) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all
                  outstanding Letters of Credit at any time exceeds the then
                  applicable Commitment shall be payable immediately; and

                                    (ii) the principal Indebtedness evidenced by
                  the Revolving Notes shall in any event be payable on the
                  Revolving Loan Maturity Date.

                           (f) The principal Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes
         may, at any time and from time to time, voluntarily be paid or prepaid
         in whole or in part without premium or penalty, except that with
         respect to any voluntary prepayment under this Subsection, (i) any
         partial prepayment of a Revolving Loan shall be not less than $100,000
         and shall be an integral multiple of $50,000 unless the entire
         outstanding amount of such Loan is being prepaid, (ii) the
         Administrative Agent shall have received written notice of any
         prepayment by 9:00 a.m. California time on the date

         be a Banking Day) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, and, in the case of
         a Eurodollar Rate Loan, three (3) Banking Days before the date of
         prepayment, which notice shall identify the date and amount of the
         prepayment and the Loan(s) being prepaid, (iii) each prepayment of
         principal on any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by payment

                  3.2 Closing Fee. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to

Revolving Loan Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the ratable accounts of the Lenders pro rata according to their Pro Rata
Share of the Revolving Commitment, a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum
times the average daily amount by which the Commitment exceeds the (i) aggregate
daily principal Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Notes plus (ii) the
Aggregate Effective Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. The
commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears as of each Quarterly
Payment Date within ten (10) days after receipt by Borrower of an invoice
therefor from the Administrative Agent.

                  3.4 Letter of Credit Fees. With respect to each Letter of
Credit, Borrower shall pay the following fees:

                           (a) concurrently with the issuance of each Standby
         Letter of Credit, to the Administrative Agent a standby letter of
         credit fee in an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.50%) per
         annum times the face amount of such Standby Letter of Credit through
         the termination or expiration of such Standby Letter of Credit, the
         first 10% of which fee the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to
         UBOC and the remainder of which fee the Administrative Agent shall
         promptly pay to the Lenders ratably, in accordance with their
         respective Pro Rata Shares of the Commitment;

         pay to the Lenders ratably, in accordance with their respective Pro
         Rata Shares of the Commitment; and

                           (c) concurrently with each negotiation, drawing or
         amendment of each Commercial Letter of Credit, to the Issuing Lender
         for the sole account of the Issuing Lender, negotiation, drawing and
         amendment fees in the amounts set forth from time to time as the

<PAGE>

         Each of the fees payable with respect to Letters of Credit under this
         Section is earned when due and is nonrefundable.

                  3.5 Increased Commitment Costs. If any Lender shall determine
in good faith that the introduction after the Closing Date of any applicable
law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change
therein or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
central bank or other Governmental Agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Eurodollar Lending
Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender, with any request, guideline
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law)
of any such central bank or other authority not imposed as a result of such
Lender's or such corporation's failure to comply with any other Laws, affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and (taking into consideration
such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy
and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines in good faith that the
amount of such capital is increased, or the rate of return on capital is
reduced, as a consequence of its obligations under this Agreement, then, within
five (5) Banking Days after demand of such Lender, Borrower shall pay to such
Lender, from time to time as specified in good faith by such Lender, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in light of such circumstances, to
the extent reasonably allocable to such obligations under this Agreement,
provided that Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such amount unless such
Lender is charging similar amounts to similarly situated Borrowers and provided
further that Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such amount which arose
prior to the date which is ninety (90) days preceding the date of such demand or
is attributable to periods prior to the date which is ninety (90) days preceding
the date of such demand, and Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such
amount if, within five (5) Banking Days after demand of such Lender, Borrower
notifies such Lender of Borrower's intention to repay all Obligations then owing
to such Lender and to terminate the Commitments of such Lender, and if Borrower
in fact repays such Obligations and terminates such Commitments within thirty
(30) days after demand of such Lender. Each Lender's determination of such
amounts shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  3.6 Eurodollar Costs and Related Matters.

                           (a) In the event that any Governmental Agency imposes
         on any Lender any reserve or comparable requirement (including any
         emergency, supplemental or other reserve) with respect to the
         Eurodollar Obligations of that Lender, Borrower shall pay that Lender
         within five (5) Banking Days after demand all amounts necessary to
         compensate such Lender (determined as though such Lender's Eurodollar
         Lending Office had funded 100% of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the
         Designated Eurodollar Market) in respect of the imposition of such
         reserve requirements (provided, that Borrower shall not be obligated to
         pay any such amount which arose prior to the date which is ninety (90)
         days preceding the date of such demand or is attributable to periods
         prior to the date which is ninety (90) days preceding the date of such
         demand). The Lender's determination of such amount shall be conclusive
         in the absence of manifest error.

                           (b) If, after the date hereof, the existence or
         occurrence of any Special Eurodollar Circumstance:

                                    (1) shall subject any Lender or its
                  Eurodollar Lending Office to any tax, duty or other charge or
                  cost with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its
                  Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to
                  make Eurodollar Rate Advances, or shall change the basis of
                  taxation of payments to any Lender attributable to the
                  principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Advance or any
                  other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of any
                  Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing
                  Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar
                  Rate Advances, excluding (i) taxes imposed on or measured in
                  whole or in part by its overall net income by (A) any
                  jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
                  organized or maintains its principal office or Eurodollar
                  Lending Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or political
                  subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing business" and (ii)
                  any withholding taxes or other taxes based on gross income
                  imposed by the United States of America for any period with
                  respect to which it has failed to provide Borrower with the
                  appropriate form or forms required by Section 11.21, to the
                  extent such forms are then required by applicable Laws; -----

                                    (2) shall impose, modify or deem applicable
                  any reserve not applicable or deemed applicable on the date
                  hereof (including any reserve imposed by the Board of
                  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, special deposit,
                  capital or similar requirements against assets of, deposits
                  with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender
                  or its Eurodollar Lending Office); or

                                    (3) shall impose on any Lender or its
                  Eurodollar Lending Office or the Designated Eurodollar Market
                  any other condition affecting any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any
                  of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans, its obligation
                  to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or this Agreement, or shall
                  otherwise affect any of the same;

         and the result of any of the foregoing, as determined in good faith by
         such Lender, increases the cost to such Lender or its Eurodollar
         Lending Office of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Advance or
         in respect of any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing
         Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate
         Advances or reduces the amount of any sum received or receivable by
         such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office with respect to any
         Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate
         Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances (assuming such
         Lender's Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100% of its Eurodollar
         Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market), then, within five
         (5) Banking Days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
         additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
         increased cost or reduction (determined as though such Lender's
         Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100% of




                                      -36-
<PAGE>

         its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market);
         provided, that Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such amount
         which arose prior to the date which is ninety (90) days preceding the
         date of such demand or is attributable to periods prior to the date
         which is ninety (90) days preceding the date of such demand. A
         statement of any Lender claiming compensation under this subsection
         shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                           (c) If, after the date hereof, the existence or
         occurrence of any Special Eurodollar Circumstance shall, in the good
         faith opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impossible for such
         Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to make, maintain or fund its
         portion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, or materially restrict the
         authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of,
         Dollars in the Designated Eurodollar Market, or to determine or charge
         interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, and such Lender shall so
         notify the Administrative Agent, then such Lender's obligation to make
         Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended for the duration of such
         illegality or impossibility and the Administrative Agent forthwith
         shall give notice thereof to the other Lenders and Borrower. Upon
         receipt of such notice, the outstanding principal amount of such
         Lender's Eurodollar Rate Advances, together with accrued interest
         thereon, automatically shall be converted to Base Rate Advances on
         either (1) the last day of the Eurodollar Period(s) applicable to such
         Eurodollar Rate Advances if such Lender may lawfully continue to
         maintain and fund such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s) or (2)
         immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to fund and
         maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s), provided that in
         such event the conversion shall not be subject to payment of a
         prepayment fee under Section 3.6(e). Each Lender agrees to endeavor
         promptly to notify Borrower of any event of which it has actual
         knowledge, occurring after the Closing Date, which will cause that
         Lender to notify the Administrative Agent under this Section, and
         agrees to designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if such
         designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the
         good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
         disadvantageous to such Lender. In the event that any Lender is unable,
         for the reasons set forth above, to make, maintain or fund its portion
         of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, such Lender shall fund such amount as a
         Base Rate Advance for the same period of time, and such amount shall be
         treated in all respects as a Base Rate Advance. Any Lender whose
         obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances has been suspended under
         this Section shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and
         Borrower of the cessation of the Special Eurodollar Circumstance which
         gave rise to such suspension.

                           (d) If, with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Rate
         Loan:

                                    (1) the Administrative Agent reasonably
                  determines that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
                  Designated Eurodollar Market generally that are beyond the
                  reasonable control of the Lenders, deposits in Dollars (in the
                  applicable amounts) are not being offered to any Lender in the
                  Designated Eurodollar Market for the applicable Eurodollar
                  Period; or



                                      -37-
<PAGE>

                                    (2) the Requisite Lenders advise the
                  Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate as determined by
                  the Administrative Agent (i) does not represent the effective
                  pricing to such Lenders for deposits in Dollars in the
                  Designated Eurodollar Market in the relevant amount for the
                  applicable Eurodollar Period, or (ii) will not adequately and
                  fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making the
                  applicable Eurodollar Rate Advances;

         then the Administrative Agent forthwith shall give notice thereof to
         Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent
         notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension
         no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make any future
         Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

                           (e) Upon payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate
         Advance (other than as the result of a conversion required under
         Section 3.6(c)) on a day other than the last day in the applicable
         Eurodollar Period (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by reason of
         acceleration, or otherwise), or upon the failure of Borrower (for a
         reason other than the breach by a Lender of its obligation pursuant to
         Section 2.1(a) to make an Advance) to borrow on the date or in the
         amount specified for a Eurodollar Rate Loan in any Request for Loan
         after such Request for Loan has become irrevocable, Borrower shall pay
         to the appropriate Lender within five (5) Banking Days after demand a
         prepayment fee or failure to borrow fee, as the case may be (determined
         as though 100% of the Eurodollar Rate Advance had been funded in the
         Designated Eurodollar Market) equal to the sum of:

                                    (1) $250; plus

                                    (2) the amount, if any, by which (i) the
                  additional interest would have accrued on the amount prepaid
                  or not borrowed at the Eurodollar Rate plus two and one-half
                  percentage points (250 basis points) if that amount had
                  remained or been outstanding through the last day of the
                  applicable Eurodollar Period exceeds (ii) the interest that
                  the Lender could recover by placing such amount on deposit in
                  the Designated Eurodollar Market for a period beginning on the
                  date of the prepayment or failure to borrow and ending on the
                  last day of the applicable Eurodollar Period (or, if no
                  deposit rate quotation is available for such period, for the
                  most comparable period for which a deposit rate quotation may
                  be obtained); plus

                                    (3) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
                  the Lender reasonably attributable to such payment, prepayment
                  or failure to borrow.

         Each Lender's determination of the amount of any prepayment fee payable
         under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
         error.

                           (f) Each Lender agrees to endeavor promptly to notify
         Borrower of any event of which it has actual knowledge, occurring after
         the Closing Date, which will entitle such Lender to compensation
         pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b) of this Section, and agrees to
         designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if such



                                      -38-
<PAGE>

         designation will avoid the need for or reduce the amount of such
         compensation and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender,
         otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Any request for
         compensation by a Lender under this Section shall set forth the basis
         upon which it has been determined that such an amount is due from
         Borrower, a calculation of the amount due, and a certification that the
         corresponding costs have been incurred by the Lender. Borrower shall
         not be obligated to pay any such compensation to a Lender under this
         Section if, within five (5) Banking Days after receiving notice from
         such Lender requesting such compensation, Borrower notifies such Lender
         of Borrower's intention to repay all Obligations then owing to such
         Lender and to terminate the Commitments of such Lender, and if Borrower
         in fact repays such Obligations and terminates such Commitments within
         thirty (30) days after Borrower receipt of such Lender's notice
         requesting compensation.

                  3.7 Late Payments. If any installment of principal or interest
or any fee or cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender is not paid when due, it shall thereafter
bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
sum of the Base Rate plus 2%, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including, without
limitation, interest on past due interest) shall be compounded monthly, on the
last day of each calendar month, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws.

                  3.8 Computation of Interest and Fees. Computation of interest
and fees under this Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360
days and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan
for the day on which the Loan is made; interest shall not accrue on a Loan, or
any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid. Any
Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for
one day. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, interest in
excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable Laws shall not accrue or be
payable hereunder or under the Notes, and any amount paid as interest hereunder
or under the Notes which would otherwise be in excess of such maximum permitted
amount shall instead be treated as a payment of principal.

                  3.9 Non-Banking Days. If any payment to be made by Borrower or
any other Party under any Loan Document shall come due on a day other than a
Banking Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding
Banking Day and the extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest
and fees.

                  3.10 Manner and Treatment of Payments.

                           (a) Each payment hereunder (except payments pursuant
         to Sections 3.5, 3.6, 11.3, 11.11 and 11.22) or on the Notes or under
         any other Loan Document shall be made to the Administrative Agent at
         the Administrative Agent's Office for the account of each of the
         Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in immediately
         available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. California time, on the day
         of payment (which must be a Banking Day). All payments received after
         such time, on any Banking Day, shall be deemed received on the next
         succeeding Banking



                                      -39-
<PAGE>

         Day. The amount of all payments received by the Administrative Agent
         for the account of each Lender shall be immediately paid by the
         Administrative Agent to the applicable Lender in immediately available
         funds and, if such payment was received by the Administrative Agent by
         11:00 a.m., California time, on a Banking Day and not so made available
         to the account of a Lender on that Banking Day, the Administrative
         Agent shall reimburse that Lender for the cost to such Lender of
         funding the amount of such payment at the Federal Funds Rate. All
         payments shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.

                           (b) Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative
         Agent to debit the general operating bank account of Borrower to effect
         any payment due to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
         this Agreement. Any resulting overdraft in such account shall be
         payable by Borrower to the Administrative Agent on the next following
         Banking Day.

                           (c) Except to the extent provided in Sections 3.5 and
         3.6(f), each payment or prepayment on account of any Loan shall be
         applied pro rata according to the outstanding Advances made by each
         Lender comprising such Loan.

                           (d) Each Lender shall use its best efforts to keep a
         record (in writing or by an electronic data entry system) of Advances
         made by it and payments received by it with respect to each of its
         Notes and, subject to Section 10.6(g), such record shall, as against
         Borrower, be presumptive evidence of the amounts owing. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing sentence, the failure by any Lender to keep such a record
         shall not affect Borrower's obligation to pay the Obligations.

                           (e) Each payment of any amount payable by Borrower or
         any other Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
         be made free and clear of, and without reduction by reason of, any
         taxes, assessments or other charges imposed by any Governmental Agency,
         central bank or comparable authority, excluding (i) taxes imposed on or
         measured in whole or in part by its overall net income by (A) any
         jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
         organized or maintains its principal office or Eurodollar Lending
         Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in
         which it is "doing business" and (ii) any withholding taxes or other
         taxes based on gross income imposed by the United States of America for
         any period with respect to which it has failed to provide Borrower with
         the appropriate form or forms required by Section 11.21, to the extent
         such forms are then required by applicable Laws (all such non-excluded
         taxes, assessments or other charges being hereinafter referred to as
         "Taxes"). To the extent that Borrower is obligated by applicable Laws
         to make any deduction or withholding on account of Taxes from any
         amount payable to any Lender under this Agreement, Borrower shall (i)
         make such deduction or withholding and pay the same to the relevant
         Governmental Agency and (ii) pay such additional amount to that Lender
         as is necessary to result in that Lender's receiving a net after-Tax
         amount equal to the amount to which that Lender would have been
         entitled under this Agreement absent such deduction or withholding. If
         and when receipt of such payment results in an



                                      -40-
<PAGE>

         excess payment or credit to that Lender on account of such Taxes, that
         Lender shall promptly refund such excess to Borrower.

                  3.11 Funding Sources. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that
it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any
particular place or manner.

                  3.12 Failure to Charge Not Subsequent Waiver. Any decision by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender not to require payment of any interest
(including interest arising under Section 3.7), fee, cost or other amount
payable under any Loan Document, or to calculate any amount payable by a
particular method, on any occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver
of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's right to require full payment of
any interest (including interest arising under Section 3.7), fee, cost or other
amount payable under any Loan Document, or to calculate an amount payable by
another method that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other or
subsequent occasion.

                  3.13 Administrative Agent's Right to Assume Payments Will be
Made. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by Borrower prior
to the date on which any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder is due that
Borrower does not intend to remit such payment, the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion, assume that Borrower has remitted such payment when so due and
the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to each Lender on such payment date an amount equal
to such Lender's share of such assumed payment. If Borrower has not in fact
remitted such payment to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall forthwith
on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment
made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each
day from and including the date such amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  3.14 Fee Determination Detail. The Administrative Agent, and
any Lender, shall provide reasonable detail to Borrower regarding the manner in
which the amount of any payment to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or
that Lender, under Article 3 has been determined, concurrently with demand for
such payment.

                  3.15 Survivability. All of Borrower's obligations under
Sections 3.5 and 3.6 shall survive for the ninety (90) day period following the
date on which the Commitment is terminated and all Loans hereunder are fully
paid, and Borrower shall remain obligated thereunder for all claims under such
Sections made by any Lender to Borrower prior to the expiration of such period
to the extent provided in such Sections.

                                   Article 4.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                  4.1 Existence and Qualification; Power; Compliance With Laws.
Borrower is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of Delaware. Borrower is duly qualified or registered to transact
business and is in good standing in California and each other jurisdiction in
which the conduct of its business or the ownership or leasing of its Properties
makes such qualification or registration necessary, except where the failure so
to qualify or register and to be in good standing would not constitute a
Material Adverse Effect. Borrower has all requisite power and authority to
conduct its business, to own and lease its Properties and to execute and deliver
each Loan Document to which it is a Party and to perform its Obligations. The
chief executive offices of Borrower are located in California. All outstanding
shares of capital stock of Borrower are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, and no holder thereof has any enforceable right of
rescission under any applicable state or federal securities Laws. Borrower is in
compliance with all Laws and other legal requirements applicable to its
business, has obtained all authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses
and permits from, and has accomplished all filings, registrations and
qualifications with, or obtained exemptions from any of the foregoing from, any
Governmental Agency that are necessary for the transaction of its business,
except where the failure so to comply, obtain authorizations, etc., file,
register, qualify or obtain exemptions does not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  4.2 Authority; Compliance With Other Agreements and

         and such Party is not in violation of, or default under, any
         Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation, or any indenture, loan or
         credit agreement described in Section 4.2(e), in any respect that
         constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.3 No Governmental Approvals Required. Except as previously
obtained or made, no authorization, consent, approval, order, license or permit
from, or filing, registration or qualification with, any Governmental Agency is
or will be required to authorize or permit under applicable Laws the execution,
delivery and performance by Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor of the Loan
Documents to which it is a Party (except where the failure to do so does not
constitute a Material Adverse Effect).

                  4.4 Subsidiaries.

                           (a) Schedule 4.4 hereto correctly sets forth the
         names, form of legal entity, number of shares of capital stock issued
         and outstanding, number of shares owned by Borrower or a Subsidiary of
         Borrower (specifying such owner) and jurisdictions of organization of
         all Subsidiaries of Borrower and specifies which thereof, as of the
         Closing Date, are Inactive Subsidiaries. Except as described in
         Schedule 4.4, Borrower does not own any capital stock, equity interest
         or debt security which is convertible, or exchangeable, for capital
         stock or equity interest in any Person. Unless otherwise indicated in
         Schedule 4.4, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, or all of
         the units of equity interest, as the case may be, of each Subsidiary
         are owned of record and beneficially by Borrower, there are no
         outstanding options, warrants or other rights to purchase capital stock
         of any such Subsidiary, and all such shares or equity interests so
         owned are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
         non-assessable, and were issued in compliance with all applicable state
         and federal securities and other Laws, and are free and clear of all
         Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

                           (b) Each Subsidiary is a legal entity of the type
         described in Schedule 4.4 duly formed, validly existing and in good
         standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, is duly
         qualified to do business as a foreign organization and is in good
         standing as such in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
         business or the ownership or leasing of its Properties makes such
         qualification necessary (except where the failure to be so duly
         qualified and in good standing does not constitute a Material Adverse
         Effect), and has all requisite power and authority to conduct its
         business and to own and lease its Properties.

                           (c) Each Subsidiary is in compliance with all Laws
         and other requirements applicable to its business and has obtained all
         authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits
         from, and each such Subsidiary has accomplished all filings,
         registrations, and qualifications with, or obtained exemptions from any
         of the foregoing from, any Governmental Agency that are necessary for
         the transaction of its business, except where the failure to be in such
         compliance, obtain such authorizations, consents, approvals, orders,
         licenses, and permits, accomplish such filings, registrations, and
         qualifications, or obtain such exemptions, does not constitute a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.5 Financial Statements. Borrower has furnished to the
Lenders (a) the audited financial statements of Borrower for the Fiscal Year
ended March 31, 2002 and (b) the unaudited balance sheet and statement of
operations of Borrower for the six-month period ended September 30, 2002. The
financial statements described in clause (a) fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial
position, and the balance sheet and statement of operations described in clause
(b) fairly present the financial condition and results of operations of Borrower
as of such dates and for such periods in conformity with GAAP consistently

contingent liability required under GAAP to be reflected or disclosed, and not
reflected or disclosed, in the balance sheet described in Section 4.5(b), other
than liabilities and contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of
business since the date of such financial statements. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.6, as of the Closing Date, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, no
circumstance or event has occurred that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect
since September 30, 2002.

possess the right to use to the extent necessary in their respective businesses,
all material trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, patent rights,
computer software, licenses and other Intangible Assets that are used in the
conduct of their businesses as now operated, and no such Intangible Asset, to
the best knowledge of Borrower, conflicts with the valid trademark, trade name,
copyright, patent, patent right or Intangible Asset of any other Person to the
extent that such conflict constitutes a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.8, Borrower has not used any trade name, trade style or
"dba" during the five year period ending on the Closing Date.

                  4.9 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                  4.10 Litigation. Except for (a) any matter fully covered as to
subject matter and amount (subject to applicable deductibles and retentions) by
insurance for which the insurance carrier has not asserted lack of subject
matter coverage or reserved its right to do so, (b) any matter, or series of
related matters, involving a claim against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
of less than $1,000,000, (c) matters of an administrative nature not involving a
claim or charge against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and (d) matters set
forth in Schedule 4.10, there are no actions, suits, proceedings or

of them before any Governmental Agency.

                  4.11 Binding Obligations. Each of the Loan Documents to which
Borrower and any Subsidiary Guarantor is a Party will, when executed and
delivered by such Party, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Party, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by Debtor Relief Laws or equitable principles
relating to the granting of specific performance and other equitable remedies as
a matter of judicial discretion.

                  4.12 No Default. No event has occurred and is continuing that
is a Default or Event of Default.

                  4.13 ERISA.

                                    (i) such Pension Plan complies in all
                  material respects with ERISA and any other applicable Laws to
                  the extent that noncompliance could reasonably be expected to
                  have a Material Adverse Effect;

                                    (ii) such Pension Plan has not incurred any
                  "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of
                  ERISA) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
                  Adverse Effect;

                                    (iii) no "reportable event" (as defined in
                  Section 4043 of ERISA, but excluding such events as to which
                  the PBGC has by regulation waived the requirement therein
                  contained that it be notified within thirty days of the
                  occurrence of such event) has occurred that could reasonably
                  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                                    (iv) neither Borrower nor any of its
                  Subsidiaries has engaged in any non-exempt "prohibited
                  transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) that
                  could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                  Effect.

                           (b) Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         incurred or expects to incur any withdrawal liability to any

proceeds of any Loan hereunder will be used to purchase or carry, or to extend

to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this Agreement, or

                           (c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the
         Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, or any of
         them, without notice to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan
         Document) or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by
         Borrower (except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan
         Document), may proceed (but only with the consent of the Requisite
         Lenders) to protect, exercise and enforce their rights and remedies
         under the Loan Documents against Borrower and any other Party and such
         other rights and remedies as are provided by Law or equity.

                           (d) The order and manner in which the Lenders' rights
         and remedies are to be exercised shall be determined by the Requisite
         Lenders in their sole discretion, and all payments received by the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, or any of
         them, shall be applied first to the costs and expenses (including
         reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and the reasonably
         allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent, the
         Collateral Agent or by any Lender) of the Administrative Agent, the
         Collateral Agent and the Lenders, and thereafter paid pro rata to the
         Lenders in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed to
         each Lender under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations
         owed under the Loan Documents to all the Lenders, without priority or
         preference among the Lenders. Regardless of how each Lender may treat
         payments for the purpose of its own accounting, for the purpose of
         computing Borrower's Obligations hereunder and under the Notes,
         payments shall be applied first, to the costs and expenses of the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, as set
         forth above, second, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest due
         under any Loan Documents to and including the date of such application
         (ratably, and




                                      -65-
<PAGE>

         without duplication, according to the accrued and unpaid interest due
         under each of the Loan Documents), and third, to the payment of all
         other amounts (including principal and fees) then owing to the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders under the
         Loan Documents. No application of payments will cure any Event of
         Default (other than an Event of Default caused by a failure to pay), or
         prevent acceleration, or continued acceleration, of amounts payable
         under the Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued
         exercise, of rights or remedies of the Lenders hereunder or thereunder
         or at Law or in equity.

                                   Article 10.
                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

                  10.1 Appointment and Authorization. Subject to Section 10.8,
each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the terms thereof or are
reasonably incidental, as determined by the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent, thereto. This appointment and authorization is intended solely
for the purpose of facilitating the servicing of the Loans and the
administration of the Collateral and does not constitute appointment of the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as trustee for any Lender or as
representative of any Lender for any other purpose and, except as specifically
set forth in the Loan Documents to the contrary, the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent shall take such action and exercise such powers only in an
administrative and ministerial capacity.

                  10.2 The Agents and Their Affiliates. UBOC (and each successor
Administrative Agent) and Comerica (and each successor Collateral Agent) have
the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though they were not the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent, respectively, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" includes UBOC
and Comerica in their individual capacities. UBOC (and each successor
Administrative Agent) and Comerica (and each successor Collateral Agent) have
and their respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrower,
any Subsidiary thereof, or any Affiliate of Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof,
as if they were not the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent,
respectively, and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. Union
Bank of California, N.A. (and each successor Administrative Agent) and Comerica
(and each successor Collateral Agent) need not account to any other Lender for
any monies received by them for reimbursement of their costs and expenses as
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder, or (subject to Section
11.10) for any monies received by them in their capacity as Lenders hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to
hold a fiduciary relationship with any Lender and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent.

                  10.3 Proportionate Interest in any Collateral. The Collateral
Agent, on behalf of all the Lenders, shall hold in accordance with the Loan
Documents all items of any collateral or interests therein received or held by
the Collateral Agent. Subject to the Collateral Agent's, the Administrative
Agent's and the Lenders' rights to reimbursement for their costs and expenses
hereunder (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and other
professional services and the reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed
by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or a Lender) and subject to
the application of payments in accordance with Section 9.2(d), each Lender shall
have an interest in the Lenders' interest in such collateral or interests
therein in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed such Lender
under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed



                                      -67-
<PAGE>

under the Loan Documents to all the Lenders, without priority or preference
among the Lenders.

                  10.4 Lenders' Credit Decisions. Each Lender agrees that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any other Lender or the directors, officers, agents, employees
or attorneys of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or of any other
Lender, and instead in reliance upon information supplied to it by or on behalf
of Borrower and upon such other information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own independent credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Lender also agrees that it shall, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent any other Lender or the
directors, officers, agents, employees or attorneys of the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent or of any other Lender, continue to make its own
independent credit analyses and decisions in acting or not acting under the Loan
Documents.

                  10.5 Action by Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.

                           (a) Absent actual knowledge of the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent of the existence of a Default, the
         Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may assume that no
         Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the Administrative Agent
         or the Collateral Agent (or the Lender that is then the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent) has received notice from Borrower
         stating the nature of the Default or has received notice from a Lender
         stating the nature of the Default and that such Lender considers the
         Default to have occurred and to be continuing.

                           (b) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
         have only those obligations under the Loan Documents as are expressly
         set forth therein.

                           (c) Except for any obligation expressly set forth in
         the Loan Documents and as long as the Administrative Agent and the
         Collateral Agent may assume that no Event of Default has occurred and
         is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may,
         but shall not be required to, exercise its reasonable discretion to act
         or not act, except that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
         Agent shall be required to act or not act upon the instructions of the
         Requisite Lenders (or of all the Lenders, to the extent required by
         Section 11.2) and those instructions shall be binding upon the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and all the Lenders,
         provided that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall
         not be required to act or not act if to do so would be contrary to any
         Loan Document or to applicable Law or would result, in the reasonable
         judgment of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in
         substantial risk of liability to the Administrative Agent or the
         Collateral Agent.

                           (d) If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent has received a notice specified in clause (a), the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent shall immediately give notice thereof to
         the Lenders and shall act or not act upon the instructions of the
         Requisite Lenders (or of all the Lenders, to the extent required by



                                      -68-
<PAGE>

         Section 11.2), provided that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent shall not be required to act or not act if to do so would be
         contrary to any Loan Document or to applicable Law or would result, in
         the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent, in substantial risk of liability to the Administrative Agent or
         the Collateral Agent, and except that if the Requisite Lenders (or all
         the Lenders, if required under Section 11.2) fail, for five (5) Banking
         Days after the receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent, to
         instruct the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, then the
         Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion,
         may act or not act as it deems advisable for the protection of the
         interests of the Lenders.

                           (e) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
         shall have no liability to any Lender for acting, or not acting, as
         instructed by the Requisite Lenders (or all the Lenders, if required
         under Section 11.2), notwithstanding any other provision hereof.

                  10.6 Liability of Agents. Neither the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, nor any directors, officers, agents, employees or
attorneys of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be liable
for any action taken or not taken by them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation on the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
their respective directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys:

                           (a) May treat the payee of any Note as the holder
         thereof until the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent receives
         notice of the assignment or transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to
         the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, signed by the payee,
         and may treat each Lender as the owner of that Lender's interest in the
         Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement until the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent receives notice of the assignment or
         transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or
         the Collateral Agent, signed by that Lender;

                           (b) May consult with legal counsel (including
         in-house legal counsel), accountants (including in-house accountants)
         and other professionals or experts selected by it, or with legal
         counsel, accountants or other professionals or experts for Borrower
         and/or their Subsidiaries or the Lenders, and shall not be liable for
         any action taken or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with
         any reasonable advice of such legal counsel, accountants or other
         professionals or experts selected by it with reasonable care;

                           (c) Shall not be responsible to any Lender for any
         statement, warranty or representation made in any of the Loan Documents
         or in any notice, certificate, report, request or other statement
         (written or oral) given or made in connection with any of the Loan
         Documents except for those expressly made by it;

                           (d) Except to the extent expressly set forth in the
         Loan Documents, shall have no duty to ask or inquire as to the
         performance or observance by Borrower



                                      -69-
<PAGE>

         or its Subsidiaries of any of the terms, conditions or covenants of any
         of the Loan Documents or to inspect any collateral or any Property,
         books or records of Borrower or its Subsidiaries;

                           (e) Will not be responsible to any Lender for the due
         execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
         effectiveness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document, any other
         instrument or writing furnished pursuant thereto or in connection
         therewith, or any Collateral;

                           (f) Will not incur any liability by acting or not
         acting in reliance upon any Loan Document, notice, consent,
         certificate, statement, request or other instrument or writing
         reasonably believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
         proper party or parties; and

                           (g) Will not incur any liability for any arithmetical
         error in computing any amount paid or payable by Borrower or any
         Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or paid or payable to or received or
         receivable from any Lender under any Loan Document, including, without
         limitation, principal, interest, commitment fees, Advances and other
         amounts; provided that such error was not the result of gross
         negligence or willful misconduct and provided further that, promptly
         upon discovery of such an error in computation, the Administrative
         Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and (to the extent applicable)
         Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall make such
         adjustments as are necessary to correct such error and to restore the
         parties to the position that they would have occupied had the error not
         occurred.

                  10.7 Indemnification. Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance
with its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments (if the Commitments are then in
effect) or in accordance with its proportion of the aggregate Indebtedness then
evidenced by the Notes (if the Commitments have then been terminated), indemnify
and hold the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys harmless against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and allocated costs of
attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent) that may
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it or them in any way relating to
or arising out of the Loan Documents (other than losses incurred by reason of
the failure of Borrower to pay the Indebtedness represented by the Notes) or any
action taken or not taken by it as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent
thereunder, except such as result from its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation on the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent upon demand for that Lender's Pro Rata
Share of any reasonable out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery, amendment, waiver, restructuring,
reorganization (including a bankruptcy reorganization), enforcement or attempted
enforcement of the Loan Documents, to the extent that Borrower or any other
Party is required by Section 11.3 to pay that cost or expense but fails to do so
upon demand. Nothing in this Section 10.7 shall entitle the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any indemnitee referred to above to recover any
amount from the Lenders if and to the extent



                                      -70-
<PAGE>

that such amount has theretofore been recovered from Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the extent that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
or any indemnitee referred to above is later reimbursed such amount by Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, it shall return the amounts paid to it by the
Lenders in respect of such amount.

                  10.8 Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent may, and at the request of the Requisite Lenders shall, resign
as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent upon reasonable notice to the
Lenders and Borrower effective upon acceptance of appointment by a successor
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. If the Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under
this Agreement, the Requisite Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent for the Lenders, which
successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be approved by Borrower
(and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no
successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and Borrower, a successor Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment
as successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent and the term
"Administrative Agent" or "Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
or Collateral Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
or Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Article 10, and Sections 11.3, 11.11
and 11.22, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) the Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent has not been paid its agency fees under Section 3.4 or has not
been reimbursed for any expense reimbursable to it under Section 11.3, in either
case for a period of at least one (1) year and (b) no successor Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's or Collateral Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's or Collateral Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any,
as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent as provided for above.

                  10.9 No Obligations of Borrower. Nothing contained in this
Article 10 shall be deemed to impose upon Borrower any obligation in respect of
the due and punctual performance by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
Agent of its obligations to the Lenders under any provision of this Agreement,
and Borrower shall have no liability to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or any of the Lenders in respect of any failure by the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to perform any of its obligations to
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where any provision
of this Agreement



                                      -71-
<PAGE>

relating to the payment of any amounts due and owing under the Loan Documents
provides that such payments shall be made by Borrower to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders, Borrower's obligations to the Lenders in
respect of such payments shall be deemed to be satisfied upon the making of such
payments to the Administrative Agent in the manner provided by this Agreement.
In addition, Borrower may rely on a written statement by the Administrative
Agent to the effect that it has obtained the written consent of the Requisite
Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable under Section 11.2, in connection
with a waiver, amendment, consent, approval or other action by the Lenders
hereunder, and shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the same.



                                      -72-
<PAGE>

                                  Article 11.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  11.1 Cumulative Remedies; No Waiver. The rights, powers,
privileges and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
the Lenders provided herein or in any Note or other Loan Document are cumulative
and not exclusive of any right, power, privilege or remedy provided by Law or
equity. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy may be,
or may be deemed to be, a waiver thereof; nor may any single or partial exercise
of any right, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
of the same or any other right, power, privilege or remedy. The terms and
conditions of Article 8 hereof are inserted for the sole benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders; the same may be
waived in whole or in part, with or without terms or conditions, in respect of
any Loan without prejudicing the Administrative Agent's or the Collateral
Agent's or the Lenders' rights to assert them in whole or in part in respect of
any other Loan.

                  11.2 Amendments; Consents. No amendment, modification,
supplement, extension, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, no approval or consent thereunder, and no consent to
any departure by Borrower or any other Party therefrom, may in any event be
effective unless in writing signed by the Administrative Agent with the written
approval of the Requisite Lenders (and, in the case of any amendment,
modification or supplement of or to any Loan Document to which Borrower is a
Party, signed by Borrower, and, in the case of any amendment, modification or
supplement to Article 10, signed by the Administrative Agent), and then only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose given; and, without the
approval in writing of all the Lenders, no amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, waiver or consent may be effective:

                           (a) To amend or modify the principal of, or the
         amount of principal, principal prepayments or the rate of interest
         payable on, any Note, or the amount of the Commitments or the Pro Rata
         Share of any Lender or the amount of any commitment fee payable to any
         Lender, or any other fee or amount payable to any Lender under the Loan
         Documents or to waive an Event of Default consisting of the failure of
         Borrower to pay when due principal, interest or any fee;

                           (b) To postpone any date fixed for any payment of
         principal of, prepayment of principal of or any installment of interest
         on, any Note or any installment of any fee, or to extend the term of
         the Commitments;

                           (c) To amend the provisions of the definition of
         "Requisite Lenders" or "Revolving Loan Maturity Date"; or

                           (d) To release any Subsidiary Guarantor from the
         Subsidiary Guaranty or to release any Collateral from the Lien of the
         Collateral Documents, except if such release of Collateral occurs in
         connection with a Disposition permitted



                                      -73-
<PAGE>

         under Section 6.2, in which case such release shall not require the
         consent of any of the Lenders; or

                           (e) To amend or waive Section 8.1 or this Section
         11.2; or

                           (f) To amend any provision of this Agreement that
         expressly requires the consent or approval of all or a specified
         portion of the Lenders.

Any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent pursuant
to this Section 11.2 shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon, all the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.

                  11.3 Costs, Expenses and Taxes. Borrower shall pay within five
(5) Banking Days after demand, accompanied by an invoice therefor, the
reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, syndication, execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents. Borrower shall also pay on demand, accompanied by an invoice
therefor, the reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, and the Lenders in connection with each amendment of or waiver
relating to the Loan Documents and in connection with the refinancing,
restructuring, reorganization (including a bankruptcy reorganization) and
enforcement or attempted enforcement of the Loan Documents, and any matter
related thereto. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include filing fees,
recording fees, title insurance fees, appraisal fees, search fees, and other
out-of-pocket expenses, and the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
any legal counsel (including reasonably allocated costs of legal counsel
employed by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or any Lender),
independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or any Lender, whether or not such
costs and expenses are incurred or suffered by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, or any Lender in connection with or during the course of any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
Borrower shall pay any and all documentary and other taxes, excluding (i) taxes
imposed on or measured in whole or in part by a Lender's overall net income
imposed on it by (A) any jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in
which it is organized or maintains its principal office or Eurodollar Lending
Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
"doing business" or (ii) any withholding taxes or other taxes based on gross
income imposed by the United States of America for any period with respect to
which it has failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form or forms
required by Section 11.21, to the extent such forms are then required by
applicable Laws, and all costs, expenses, fees and charges payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the filing or recording of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or writing to be delivered hereunder
or thereunder, or in connection with any transaction pursuant hereto or thereto,
and shall reimburse, hold harmless and indemnify on the terms set forth in 11.11
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders from and against
any and all loss, liability or legal or other expense with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or failure to pay any such tax, cost,
expense, fee or charge or that any of them may suffer or incur by reason of the
failure of any Party to perform any of its Obligations. Any amount payable to
the Administrative

Agent, the Collateral Agent, or any Lender under this Section 11.3 shall bear
interest from the fifth Banking Day following the date of demand for payment at
the Default Rate.

                  11.4 Nature of Lenders' Obligations. The obligations of the
Lenders hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several. Nothing
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or the Lenders or any of them
pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make the Lenders a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or other entity, either among
themselves or with the Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower. A default by any
Lender will not increase the Pro Rata Share of the Commitments attributable to
any other Lender. Any Lender not in default may, if it desires, assume in such
proportion as the nondefaulting Lenders agree the obligations of any Lender in
default, but is not obligated to do so. The Administrative Agent agrees that it
will use its best efforts either to induce promptly the other Lenders to assume
the obligations of a Lender in default or to obtain promptly another Lender,
reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, to replace such a Lender in default.

                  11.5 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained herein or in any other Loan Document,
or in any certificate or other writing delivered by or on behalf of any one or
more of the Parties to any Loan Document, will survive the making of the Loans
hereunder and the execution and delivery of the Notes, and have been or will be
relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, and each Lender,
notwithstanding any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, or any Lender or on their behalf.

                  11.6 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Loan Documents, all notices, requests, demands, directions and other
communications provided for hereunder or under any other Loan Document must be
in writing and must be mailed, telegraphed, telecopied, dispatched by commercial
courier or delivered to the appropriate party at the address set forth on the
signature pages of this Agreement or other applicable Loan Document or, as to
any party to any Loan Document, at any other address as may be designated by it
in a written notice sent to all other parties to such Loan Document in
accordance with this Section. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any Loan
Document, if any notice, request, demand, direction or other communication
required or permitted by any Loan Document is given by mail it will be effective
on the earlier of receipt or the fourth Banking Day after deposit in the United
States mail with first class or airmail postage prepaid; if given by telegraph
or cable, when delivered to the telegraph company with charges prepaid; if given
by telecopier, when sent; if dispatched by commercial courier, on the scheduled
delivery date; or if given by personal delivery, when delivered.

                  11.7 Execution of Loan Documents. Unless the Administrative
Agent otherwise specifies with respect to any Loan Document, (a) this Agreement
and any other Loan Document may be executed in any number of counterparts and
any party hereto or thereto may execute any counterpart, each of which when
executed and delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, as the case may be,
when taken together will be deemed to be but one and the same instrument and (b)
execution of any such counterpart may be evidenced by a telecopier transmission
of the signature of such party. The execution of this Agreement or any other



                                      -75-
<PAGE>

Loan Document by any party hereto or thereto will not become effective until
counterparts hereof or thereof, as the case may be, have been executed by all
the parties hereto or thereto.

                  11.8 Binding Effect; Assignment.

                           (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
         which Borrower is a Party will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
         of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each of
         the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns, except that
         Borrower may not assign its rights hereunder or thereunder or any
         interest herein or therein without the prior written consent of all the
         Lenders. Each Lender represents that it is not acquiring its Note with
         a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
         Act of 1933, as amended (subject to any requirement that disposition of
         such Note must be within the control of such Lender). Any Lender may at
         any time pledge its Note or any other instrument evidencing its rights
         as a Lender under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank, but no such
         pledge shall release that Lender from its obligations hereunder or
         grant to such Federal Reserve Bank the rights of a Lender hereunder
         absent foreclosure of such pledge.

                           (b) From time to time following the Closing Date,
         each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any
         portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments; provided that (i)
         such Eligible Assignee, if not then a Lender or an Affiliate of the
         assigning Lender, shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and (if
         no Event of Default then exists) Borrower (neither of which approvals
         shall be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) such assignment shall
         be evidenced by a Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, a copy of which
         shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent as hereinbelow provided,
         (iii) except in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the
         assigning Lender, to another Lender or of the entire remaining
         Commitments of the assigning Lender, the assignment shall not assign a
         Pro Rata Share of the Commitments that is equivalent to less than
         $5,000,000 and (iv) the effective date of any such assignment shall be
         as specified in the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, but not
         earlier than the date which is five (5) Banking Days after the date the
         Administrative Agent has received the Commitment Assignment and
         Acceptance. Upon the effective date of such Commitment Assignment and
         Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee named therein shall be a Lender for
         all purposes of this Agreement, with the Pro Rata Share of the
         Commitments therein set forth and, to the extent of such Pro Rata
         Share, the assigning Lender shall be released from its further
         obligations under this Agreement. Borrower agrees that it shall execute
         and deliver (against delivery by the assigning Lender to Borrower of
         its Notes) to such assignee Lender, Notes evidencing that assignee
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Commitments, and to the assigning
         Lender, Notes evidencing the remaining balance Pro Rata Share retained
         by the assigning Lender.

                           (c) By executing and delivering a Commitment
         Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder
         acknowledges and agrees that: (i) other than the representation and
         warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the Pro Rata
         Share of the Commitments being assigned thereby free and clear of any
         adverse



                                      -76-
<PAGE>

         claim, the assigning Lender has made no representation or warranty and
         assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
         representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the
         execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness or
         sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (ii) the
         assigning Lender has made no representation or warranty and assumes no
         responsibility with respect to the financial condition of Borrower or
         the performance by Borrower of the Obligations; (iii) it has received a
         copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent
         financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 and such other
         documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
         credit analysis and decision to enter into such Commitment Assignment
         and Acceptance; (iv) it will, independently and without reliance upon
         the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender and based
         on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
         time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
         action under this Agreement; (v) it appoints and authorizes the
         Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action and
         to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
         Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent by this Agreement; and
         (vi) it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
         obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
         performed by it as a Lender.

                           (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at the
         Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Commitment Assignment and
         Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register") of the names
         and address of each of the Lenders and the Pro Rata Share of the
         Commitments held by each Lender, giving effect to each Commitment
         Assignment and Acceptance. The Register shall be available during
         normal business hours for inspection by Borrower or any Lender upon
         reasonable prior notice to the Administrative Agent. After receipt of a
         completed Commitment Assignment and Acceptance executed by any Lender
         and an Eligible Assignee, and receipt of an assignment fee of $3,000
         from such Lender or Eligible Assignee, the Administrative Agent shall,
         promptly following the effective date thereof, provide to Borrower and
         the Lenders a revised Schedule 1.1 giving effect thereto. Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders shall deem
         and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders
         and owners of the Pro Rata Share of the Commitments listed therein for
         all purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Pro Rata
         Share of the Commitments shall be effective, in each case unless and
         until a Commitment Assignment and Acceptance effecting the assignment
         or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by the Administrative
         Agent and recorded in the Register as provided above. Prior to such
         recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the applicable Pro Rata
         Share of the Commitments shall be owed to the Lender listed in the
         Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of
         any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such
         authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be
         conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee
         of the corresponding Pro Rata Share of the Commitments.

                           (e) Each Lender may from time to time grant
         participations to one or more banks or other financial institutions in
         a portion of its Pro Rata Share of the



                                      -77-
<PAGE>

         Commitments; provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
         under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
         remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
         performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating banks or other
         financial institutions shall not be a Lender hereunder for any purpose
         except, if the participation agreement so provides, for the purposes of
         Sections 3.6, 3.7, 11.11 and 11.22 but only to the extent that the cost
         of such benefits to Borrower does not exceed the cost which Borrower
         would have incurred in respect of such Lender absent the participation,
         (iv) Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, and the
         other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
         Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
         this Agreement, (v) the participation interest shall be expressed as a
         percentage of the granting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Commitments
         as it then exists and shall not restrict an increase in the
         Commitments, or in the granting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
         Commitments, so long as the amount of the participation interest is not
         affected thereby, (vi) the holder of the participation interest shall
         abide by the confidentiality provisions set forth herein and (vii) the
         consent of the holder of such participation interest shall not be
         required for amendments or waivers of provisions of the Loan Documents
         other than those which (A) extend the Revolving Loan Maturity Date or
         any other date upon which any payment of money is due to the Lenders,
         (B) reduce the rate of interest on the Notes, any fee or any other
         monetary amount payable to the Lenders, (C) reduce the amount of any
         installment of principal due under the Notes, (D) release any
         Subsidiary Guaranty, or (E) release any Collateral from the Lien of the
         Collateral Documents, except if such release of Collateral occurs in
         connection with a Disposition permitted under Section 6.2, in which
         case such release shall not require the consent of any of the Lenders
         or of any holder of a participation interest in the Commitments.

                  11.9 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender (but
in each case only with the consent of the Requisite Lenders) may exercise its
rights under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable Laws
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, apply any funds in any deposit
account maintained with it by Borrower and/or any Property of Borrower in its
possession against the Obligations.

                  11.10 Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender severally agrees that if
it, through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim
against Borrower, or otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it
that is ratably more than any other Lender, through any means, receives in
payment of the Obligations held by that Lender, then, subject to applicable
Laws: (a) the Lender exercising the right of setoff, banker's lien or
counterclaim or otherwise receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be
deemed to have simultaneously purchased, from each of the other Lenders a
participation in the Obligations held by the other Lenders and shall pay to the
other Lenders a purchase price in an amount so that the share of the Obligations
held by each Lender after the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or
counterclaim or receipt of payment shall be in the same proportion that existed
prior to the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or
receipt of payment; and (b) such other adjustments and purchases of
participations shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure
that all of the Lenders share any payment obtained



                                      -78-
<PAGE>

in respect of the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Lender's share of
the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into account, the
payment; provided that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment
obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien,
counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender by
Borrower or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrower,
the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price
thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without interest.
Each Lender that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant to this
Section 11.10 shall from and after the purchase have the right to give all
notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this
Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same
extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the
Obligations purchased. Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements
and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in an Obligation so purchased
pursuant to this Section 11.10 may exercise any and all rights of setoff,
banker's lien or counterclaim with respect to the participation as fully as if
the Lender were the original owner of the Obligation purchased.

                  11.11 Indemnity by Borrower. Borrower agrees to indemnify,
save and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, and each
Lender and their respective directors, officers, agents, attorneys and employees
(collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against: (a) any and all claims,
demands, actions or causes of action (except a claim, demand, action, or cause
of action for any amount excluded from the definition of "Taxes" in Section
3.12(d)) if the claim, demand, action or cause of action arises out of or
relates to any act or omission (or alleged act or omission) of Borrower, its
Affiliates or any of its officers, directors or stockholders relating to the
Commitment, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of any Loan, or the
relationship of Borrower and the Lenders under this Agreement; (b) any
administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental Agency arising
out of or related to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in
clause (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses, reasonable costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the reasonably allocated
costs of attorneys employed by any Indemnitee and disbursements of such
attorneys and other professional services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs
as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of
action; provided that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any
loss caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss
asserted against it by another Indemnitee. If any claim, demand, action or cause
of action is asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall promptly
notify Borrower, but the failure to so promptly notify Borrower shall not affect
Borrower's obligations under this Section unless such failure materially
prejudices Borrower's right to participate in the contest of such claim, demand,
action or cause of action, as hereinafter provided. Such Indemnitee may (and
shall, if requested by Borrower in writing) contest the validity, applicability
and amount of such claim, demand, action or cause of action and shall permit
Borrower to participate in such contest. Such Indemnitee shall act reasonably
and in good faith in dealing with such claim, demand, action or cause of action,
including in electing whether to offer or accept any settlement or compromise of
such claim, demand, action or cause of action. Borrower shall have the burden of
establishing the lack of good faith or reasonableness of such Indemnitee. Any
Indemnitee that proposes to settle or compromise any claim or proceeding for
which Borrower may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give
Borrower written notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise
reasonably in advance of



                                      -79-
<PAGE>

settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain Borrower's
prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In
connection with any claim, demand, action or cause of action covered by this
Section 11.11 against more than one Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees shall be
represented by the same legal counsel (which may be a law firm engaged by the
Indemnitees or attorneys employed by an Indemnitee or a combination of the
foregoing) selected by the Indemnitees and reasonably acceptable to Borrower;
provided, that if such legal counsel determines in good faith that representing
all such Indemnitees would or could result in a conflict of interest under Laws
or ethical principles applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense or
counterclaim is available to an Indemnitee that is not available to all such
Indemnitees, then to the extent reasonably necessary to avoid such a conflict of
interest or to permit unqualified assertion of such a defense or counterclaim,
each affected Indemnitee shall be entitled to separate representation by legal
counsel selected by that Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to Borrower, with
all such legal counsel using reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication
of effort by counsel for all Indemnitees; and further provided that the
Administrative Agent (as an Indemnitee) shall at all times be entitled to
representation by separate legal counsel (which may be a law firm or attorneys
employed by the Administrative Agent or a combination of the foregoing). Any
obligation or liability of Borrower to any Indemnitee under this Section 11.11
shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of all Loans and the payment and performance of all other Obligations owed to
the Lenders.

                  11.12 Nonliability of the Lenders. Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that:

                           (a) Any inspections of any Property of Borrower made
         by or through the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
         Lenders are for purposes of administration of the Loan only and
         Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or not such
         inspections are at the expense of Borrower);

                           (b) By accepting or approving anything required to be
         observed, performed, fulfilled or given to the Administrative Agent,
         the Collateral Agent or the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents,
         neither the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent nor the Lenders
         shall be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency,
         legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term,
         provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof
         shall not constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with
         respect thereto by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
         the Lenders;

                           (c) The relationship between Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders is, and
         shall at all times remain, solely that of borrowers and lenders;
         neither the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent nor the Lenders
         shall under any circumstance be construed to be partners or joint
         venturers of Borrower or its Affiliates; neither the Administrative
         Agent, the Collateral Agent nor the Lenders shall under any
         circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust
         or a fiduciary relationship with Borrower or its Affiliates, or to owe
         any fiduciary duty to Borrower or its Affiliates; neither the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent nor the Lenders undertake or
         assume any responsibility or duty to Borrower or its Affiliates to
         select, review, inspect, supervise,



                                      -80-
<PAGE>

         pass judgment upon or inform Borrower or its Affiliates of any matter
         in connection with their Property or the operations of Borrower or its
         Affiliates; Borrower and its Affiliates shall rely entirely upon their
         own judgment with respect to such matters; and any review, inspection,
         supervision, exercise of judgment or supply of information undertaken
         or assumed by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
         Lenders in connection with such matters is solely for the protection of
         the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders and
         neither Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely thereon; and

                           (d) The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
         and the Lenders shall not be responsible or liable to any Person for
         any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or
         death to Persons or damage to Property caused by the actions, inaction
         or negligence of Borrower and/or its Affiliates and Borrower hereby
         indemnifies and holds the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
         and the Lenders harmless on the terms set forth in Section 11.11 from
         any such loss, damage, liability or claim.

                  11.13 No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made for
the purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties
of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders in
connection with the Loans, and is made for the sole benefit of Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, and the
Administrative Agent's, the Collateral Agent's and the Lenders' successors and
assigns. Except as provided in Sections 11.8 and 11.11, no other Person shall
have any rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof.

                  11.14 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any
confidential information that it may receive from Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure: (a) to other Lenders or
Affiliates of a Lender; (b) to legal counsel and accountants for Borrower or any
Lender; (c) to other professional advisors to Borrower or any Lender, provided
that the recipient has accepted such information subject to a confidentiality
agreement substantially similar to this Section 11.14; (d) to regulatory
officials having jurisdiction over that Lender; (e) as required by Law or legal
process, provided that each Lender agrees to notify Borrower of any such
disclosures unless prohibited by applicable Laws, or in connection with any
legal proceeding to which that Lender and Borrower are adverse parties; and (f)
to another financial institution in connection with a disposition or proposed
disposition to that financial institution of all or part of that Lender's
interests hereunder or a participation interest in its Notes, provided that the
recipient has accepted such information subject to a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to this Section 11.14. For purposes of the foregoing,
"confidential information" shall mean any information respecting Borrower or its
Subsidiaries reasonably considered by Borrower to be confidential, other than
(i) information previously filed with any Governmental Agency and available to
the public, (ii) information previously published in any public medium from a
source other than, directly or indirectly, that Lender, and (iii) information
previously disclosed by Borrower to any Person not associated with Borrower
which does not owe a professional duty of confidentiality to Borrower or which
has not executed an appropriate confidentiality agreement with Borrower. Nothing
in this Section shall be construed to create or give rise to



                                      -81-
<PAGE>

any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
or the Lenders to Borrower.

                  11.15 Further Assurances. Borrower shall, at its expense and
without expense to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, or the Collateral
Agent, do, execute and deliver such further acts and documents as the Requisite
Lenders, the Administrative Agent, or the Collateral Agent from time to time
reasonably require for the assuring and confirming unto the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, or the Collateral Agent of the rights hereby created or
intended now or hereafter so to be, or for carrying out the intention or
facilitating the performance of the terms of any Loan Document.

                  11.16 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other
Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties
on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or
oral, on the subject matter hereof, including the Existing Loan Agreement and
all Loan Documents referred to therein. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control and govern; provided that the
inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not
be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with
the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed
neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the
fair meaning thereof.

                  11.17 Governing Law; JURISDICTION AND VENUE. Except to the
extent otherwise provided therein, each Loan Document shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of California applicable to
contracts made and performed in California. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL ACTIONS
OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED AND
LITIGATED ONLY IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY SUBMIT AND CONSENT IN ADVANCE TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE
ANY OBJECTION THEY MAY HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND HEREBY
CONSENT TO THE GRANTING OF SUCH LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RELIEF AS IS DEEMED
APPROPRIATE BY ANY SUCH COURT. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO ASSERT THAT
ANY SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR OTHERWISE TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE
EXTENT ANY PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 11.17.

                  11.18 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable or invalid as to any
party or in any jurisdiction shall, as to that party or jurisdiction, be
inoperative, unenforceable or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions
or the operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to any other
party or in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan
Documents are declared to be severable.

                  11.19 Headings. Article and Section headings in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and
are not part of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other
purpose.

                  11.20 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents.

                  11.21 Foreign Lenders and Participants. Each Lender that is
incorporated or otherwise organized under the Laws of a jurisdiction other than
the United States of America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia
shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), on or
before the Closing Date (or on or before accepting an assignment or receiving a
participation interest herein pursuant to Section 11.8, if applicable) two duly
completed copies, signed by a Responsible Official, of either Form 1001
(relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete exemption from
withholding on all payments to be made to such Lender by Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement) or Form 4224 (relating to all payments to be made to such Lender
by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) of the United States Internal
Revenue Service or such other evidence (including, if reasonably necessary, Form
W-9) satisfactory to Borrower and the Administrative Agent that no withholding
under the federal income tax laws is required with respect to such Lender.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Lender shall (a) promptly submit to
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), such additional duly
completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as
shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing
authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and
regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of any available exemption from, United States withholding
taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by Borrower pursuant
to this Agreement and (b) take such steps as shall not be materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be
reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Eurodollar Lending
Office, if any) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that Borrower make
any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. In
the event that Borrower or the Administrative Agent become aware that a
participation has been granted pursuant to Section 11.8(e) to a financial
institution that is incorporated or otherwise organized under the Laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the
District of Columbia, then, upon request made by Borrower or the Administrative
Agent to the Lender which granted such participation, such Lender shall cause
such participant financial institution to deliver the same documents and
information to Borrower and the Administrative Agent as would be required under
this Section if such financial institution were a Lender.

                  11.22 Hazardous Material Indemnity. Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, hold harmless and defend (by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent) the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each of
the Lenders and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, losses, damages,
liabilities, fines, penalties, charges, administrative and judicial proceedings
and orders, judgments, remedial action requirements, enforcement actions of any
kind, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith
(including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and the reasonably
allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
and expenses to the extent that the



                                      -83-
<PAGE>

defense of any such action has not been assumed by Borrower), arising directly
or indirectly out of (i) the presence on, in, under or about any Real Property
of any Hazardous Materials, or any releases or discharges of any Hazardous
Materials on, under or from any Real Property and (ii) any activity carried on
or undertaken on or off any Real Property by Borrower or any of its predecessors
in title, whether prior to or during the term of this Agreement, and whether by
Borrower or any predecessor in title or any employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors of Borrower or any predecessor in title, or any third persons at
any time occupying or present on any Real Property, in connection with the
handling, treatment, removal, storage, decontamination, clean-up, transport or
disposal of any Hazardous Materials at any time located or present on, in, under
or about any Real Property. The foregoing indemnity shall further apply to any
residual contamination on, in, under or about any Real Property, or affecting
any natural resources, and to any contamination of any Property or natural
resources arising in connection with the generation, use, handling, storage,
transport or disposal of any such Hazardous Materials, and irrespective of
whether any of such activities were or will be undertaken in accordance with
applicable Laws, but the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to Hazardous
Materials on any Real Property, the presence of which is caused by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders. Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees
that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents to the contrary, the obligations of Borrower under this Section
shall be unlimited corporate obligations of Borrower and shall not be secured by
any Lien on any Real Property. Any obligation or liability of Borrower to any
Indemnitee under this Section 11.22 shall survive the expiration or termination
of this Agreement and the repayment of all Loans and the payment and performance
of all other Obligations owed to the Lenders.

                  11.23 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. BORROWER HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR
TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND BORROWER HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
CONSENT OF BORROWER TO THE WAIVER OF BORROWER'S RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

                  11.24 Purported Oral Amendments. BORROWER EXPRESSLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY ONLY BE
AMENDED OR MODIFIED, OR THE PROVISIONS HEREOF OR THEREOF WAIVED OR SUPPLEMENTED,
BY AN INSTRUMENT IN WRITING THAT COMPLIES WITH SECTION 11.2. BORROWER AGREES
THAT IT WILL NOT RELY ON ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR ORAL
OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS BY ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY
BANK THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH



                                      -84-
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.2 TO EFFECT AN AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, WAIVER OR SUPPLEMENT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
