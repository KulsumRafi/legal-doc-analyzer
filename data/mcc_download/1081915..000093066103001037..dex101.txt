<PAGE>

          and validly completed, to be in recordable form and sufficient to
          effect the assignment of and transfer to the assignee thereof, under
          the Mortgage to which the assignment relates); provided that, if the

          assurance or substitution agreement, if any;

     (e)  either the original or duplicate original title policy (including all

          escrow company with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and

     (f)  in the case of a Cooperative Loan, the originals of the following
          documents or instruments:

                   (3)  The executed Proprietary Lease;

                   (4)  The executed Recognition Agreement;

                   (5)  The executed UCC-1 financing statement with evidence of
          recording thereon which have been filed in all places required to
          perfect the Seller's interest in the Coop Shares and the Proprietary
          Lease; and

                   (6)  Executed UCC-3 financing statements or other appropriate

     In the event that in connection with any Mortgage Loan the Seller cannot
deliver (i) the original recorded Mortgage or (ii) all interim recorded
assignments satisfying the requirements of clause (b) or (c) above,
respectively, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof because such
document or documents have not been returned from the applicable public
recording office, the Seller shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf such original Mortgage or such
interim assignment, as the case may be, with evidence of recording indicated
thereon upon receipt thereof from the public recording office, or a copy
thereof, certified, if appropriate, by the relevant recording office, but in no
event shall any such delivery of the original Mortgage and each such interim
assignment or a copy thereof, certified, if appropriate, by the relevant
recording office, be made later than one year following the

                                       -6-

<PAGE>

Closing Date; provided, however, in the event the Seller is unable to deliver or
cause to be delivered by such date each Mortgage and each such interim
assignment by reason of the fact that any such documents have not been returned
by the appropriate recording office, or, in the case of each such interim
assignment, because the related Mortgage has not been returned by the
appropriate recording office, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered
such documents to the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf as promptly as
possible upon receipt thereof and, in any event, within 720 days following the
Closing Date. The Seller shall forward or cause to be forwarded to the Trustee
or the Custodian on its behalf (i) from time to time additional original
documents evidencing an assumption or modification of a Mortgage Loan and (ii)
any other documents required to be delivered by the Seller to the Trustee. In
the event that the original Mortgage is not delivered and in connection with the
payment in full of the related Mortgage Loan and the public recording office
requires the presentation of a "lost instruments affidavit and indemnity" or any
equivalent document, because only a copy of the Mortgage can be delivered with
the instrument of satisfaction or reconveyance, the Seller shall execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such a document to the public
recording office. In the case where a public recording office retains the
original recorded Mortgage or in the case where a Mortgage is lost after
recordation in a public recording office, the Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf a copy of such
Mortgage certified by such public recording office to be a true and complete
copy of the original recorded Mortgage.

     In addition, in the event that in connection with any Mortgage Loan the
Seller cannot deliver or cause to be delivered the original or duplicate
original lender's title policy (together with all riders thereto), satisfying
the requirements of clause (v) above, concurrently with the execution and
delivery hereof because the related Mortgage has not been returned from the
applicable public recording office, the Seller shall promptly deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf such original or
duplicate original lender's title policy (together with all riders thereto) upon
receipt thereof from the applicable title insurer, but in no event shall any
such delivery of the original or duplicate original lender's title policy be
made later than one year following the Closing Date; provided, however, in the
event the Seller is unable to deliver or cause to be delivered by such date the
original or duplicate original lender's title policy (together with all riders
thereto) because the related Mortgage has not been returned by the appropriate
recording office, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered such
documents to the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf as promptly as possible
upon receipt thereof and, in any event, within 720 days following the Closing
Date.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, within thirty
days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall either (i) deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian on its behalf the Mortgage File as
required pursuant to this Section 3.1 for each Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan or
(ii) (A) substitute or cause to be substituted a Substitute Mortgage Loan for
the Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan or (B) repurchase or cause to be repurchased
the Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan, which substitution or repurchase shall be
accomplished in the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in Section
4.1 (treating each Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan as a Deleted Mortgage Loan for
purposes of such Section 4.1), provided, however, that if the Seller fails to
deliver a Mortgage File for any Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan within the
thirty-day period provided in the prior sentence, the Seller shall use its best
reasonable efforts to effect or cause to be effected a substitution, rather than
a repurchase of, such Deleted Mortgage Loan and provided further that the cure
period provided for in Section 4.1 hereof shall

                                       -7-

<PAGE>

not apply to the initial delivery of the Mortgage File for such Delay Delivery
Mortgage Loan, but rather the Seller shall have five (5) Business Days to cure
or cause to be cured such failure to deliver.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.

                   (2)  The Seller has the full corporate power and authority to

          constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
          enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except
          that (a) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
          insolvency, moratorium, receivership and other similar laws relating
          to creditors' rights generally and (b) the remedy of specific
          performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
          subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
          before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

                   (3)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
          Seller, the sale of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller under this
          Agreement, the consummation of any other of the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement, and the fulfillment of or compliance
          with the terms thereof are in the ordinary course of business of the
          Seller and will not (a) result in a material breach of any term or
          provision of the charter or by-laws of the Seller or (b) materially
          conflict with, result in a material breach, violation or acceleration
          of, or result in a material default under, the terms of any other
          material agreement or instrument to which the Seller is a party or by
          which it may be bound, or (c) constitute a material violation of any
          statute, order or regulation applicable to the Seller of any court,
          regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having
          jurisdiction over the Seller; and the Seller is not in breach or
          violation of any material indenture or other material agreement or
          instrument, or in violation of

                                       -8-

<PAGE>

          any statute, order or regulation of any court, regulatory body,
          administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over it
          which breach or violation may materially impair the Seller's ability
          to perform or meet any of its obligations under this Agreement.

                   (4)  No litigation is pending or, to the best of the Seller's
          knowledge, threatened against the Seller that would prohibit the
          execution or delivery of, or performance under, this Agreement by the
          Seller.

     (b)  The Seller hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth
          in Schedule B hereto to the Purchaser, as of the Closing Date, or if
          so specified therein, as of the Cut-off Date.

     (c)  Upon discovery by either of the parties hereto of a breach of a
          representation or warranty made pursuant to Schedule B hereto that
          materially and adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser in any
          Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
          notice thereof to the other party. The Seller hereby covenants that
          within 90 days of the earlier of its discovery or its receipt of
          written notice from the Purchaser of a breach of any representation or
          warranty made pursuant to Schedule B hereto which materially and
          adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser in any Mortgage Loan,
          it shall cure such breach in all material respects, and if such breach
          is not so cured, shall, (i) if such 90-day period expires prior to the
          second anniversary of the Closing Date, remove such Mortgage Loan (a
          "Deleted Mortgage Loan") from the pool of mortgages listed on Schedule
          B hereto and substitute in its place a Substitute Mortgage Loan, in
          the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section; or
          (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans from the
          Purchaser at the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price in the manner set forth
          below. With respect to the representations and warranties described in
          this Section which are made to the best of the Seller's knowledge, if
          it is discovered by either the Seller or the Purchaser that the
          substance of such representation and warranty is inaccurate and such
          inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of the related
          Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Purchaser therein,
          notwithstanding the Seller's lack of knowledge with respect to the
          substance of such representation or warranty, such inaccuracy shall be
          deemed a breach of the applicable representation or warranty.

          With respect to any Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Seller
     shall deliver to the Trustee or to the Custodian on its behalf the Mortgage
     Note, the Mortgage, the related assignment of the Mortgage, and such other

     Note endorsed and the Mortgage assigned as required by Section 3.1. No
     substitution is permitted to be made in any calendar month after the
     Determination Date for such month. Scheduled Payments due with respect to
     Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution will be retained by
     the Seller. Upon such substitution, the Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans
     shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects, and the
     Seller shall be deemed to have made with respect to such Substitute
     Mortgage Loan or Loans, as of the date of substitution, the

     representations and warranties made pursuant to Schedule B hereto with
     respect to such Mortgage Loan.

          It is understood and agreed that the obligation under this Agreement
     of the Seller to cure, repurchase or replace any Mortgage Loan as to which
     a breach has occurred and is continuing shall constitute the sole remedy
     against the Seller respecting such breach available to the Purchaser on its
     behalf.

     The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall not be
construed as a warranty or guaranty by the Seller as to the future payments by
any Mortgagor.

     It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 4.1 shall survive the sale of the Mortgage Loans to the
Purchaser hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE V
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 5.1   Transfer Intended as Sale. It is the express intent of the
parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the
Purchaser be, and be construed as, an absolute sale thereof in accordance with
GAAP and for regulatory purposes. It is, further, not the intention of the
parties that such conveyances be deemed a pledge thereof by the Seller to the
Purchaser. However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the
parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be the property of the Seller or the
Purchaser, respectively, or if for any other reason this Agreement is held or
deemed to create a security interest in such assets, then (i) this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code of the State of Texas and (ii) the conveyance of the Mortgage
Loans provided for in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an assignment and a
grant by the Seller to the Purchaser of a security interest in all of the
Mortgage Loans, whether now owned or hereafter acquired.

     The Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the extent consistent with this
Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this
Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans, such
security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first
priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term
of the Agreement. The Seller and the Purchaser shall arrange for filing any
Uniform Commercial Code continuation statements in connection with any security
interest granted hereby.

     Section 5.2   Seller's Consent to Assignment. The Seller hereby
acknowledges the Purchaser's right to assign, transfer and convey all of the
Purchaser's rights under this Agreement to a third party and that the
representations and warranties made by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement will, in the case of such assignment, transfer and conveyance, be
for the benefit of such third party. The Seller hereby consents to such
assignment, transfer and conveyance.

     Section 5.3   Specific Performance. Either party or its assignees may
enforce specific performance of this Agreement.

                                   SCHEDULE A

                              [BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE]

<PAGE>

                                   SCHEDULE B

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO THE MORTGAGE LOANS

     First Horizon Home Loan Corporation (the "Seller") hereby makes the
representations and warranties set forth in this Schedule B on which First
Tennessee Bank National Association (the "Purchaser") relies in accepting the
Mortgage Loans. Such representations and warranties speak as of the execution
and delivery of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 28,
2003 (the "MLPA"), between First Horizon Home Loan Corporation, as seller, and
the Purchaser and as of the Closing Date, or if so specified herein, as of the
Cut-off Date or date of origination of the Mortgage Loans, but shall survive the
sale, transfer, and assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser and any
subsequent sale, transfer and assignment by the Purchaser to a third party.
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Schedule B shall have
the meanings ascribed thereto in the MLPA.

     (1)  The information set forth on Schedule A to the MLPA, with respect to
          each Mortgage Loan is true and correct in all material respects as of
          the Closing Date.

     (2)  Each Mortgage is a valid and enforceable first lien on the Mortgaged
          Property subject only to (a) the lien of nondelinquent current real
          property taxes and assessments and liens or interests arising under or
          as a result of any federal, state or local law, regulation or
          ordinance relating to hazardous wastes or hazardous substances and, if
          the related Mortgaged Property is a unit in a condominium project or
          Planned Unit Development, any lien for common charges permitted by
          statute or homeowner association fees, (b) covenants, conditions and
          restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public
          record as of the date of recording of such Mortgage, such exceptions
          appearing of record being generally acceptable to mortgage lending
          institutions in the area wherein the related Mortgaged Property is
          located or specifically reflected in the appraisal made in connection
          with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, and (c) other
          matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do not
          materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be
          provided by such Mortgage.

     (3)  Immediately prior to the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the
          Purchaser, the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of,
          each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or
          security interest and had full right and authority, subject to no
          interest or participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to
          sell and assign the same pursuant to this Agreement.

     (4)  As of the date of origination of each Mortgage Loan, there was no
          delinquent tax or assessment lien against the related Mortgaged
          Property.

     (5)  There is no valid offset, defense or counterclaim to any Mortgage Note
          or Mortgage, including the obligation of the Mortgagor to pay the
          unpaid principal of or interest on such Mortgage Note.

                                       B-1

<PAGE>

     (6)  There are no mechanics' liens or claims for work, labor or material
          affecting any Mortgaged Property which are or may be a lien prior to,
          or equal with, the lien of such Mortgage, except those which are
          insured against by the title insurance policy referred to in item (10)
          below.

     (7)  To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no Mortgaged Property has been
          materially damaged by water, fire, earthquake, windstorm, flood,
          tornado or similar casualty (excluding casualty from the presence of
          hazardous wastes or hazardous substances, as to which the Seller makes
          no representation) so as to affect adversely the value of the related
          Mortgaged Property as security for such Mortgage Loan.

     (8)  Each Mortgage Loan at origination complied in all material respects
          with applicable state and federal laws, including, without limitation,
          usury, equal credit opportunity, real estate settlement procedures,
          truth-in-lending and disclosure laws or any noncompliance does not
          have a material adverse effect on the value of the related Mortgage
          Loan.

     (9)  No Mortgage Loan is a "High Cost Home Loan" or "Covered Loan" within
          the meaning of the Georgia Fair Lending Act.

     (10) Except as reflected in a written document contained in the related
          Mortgage File, the Seller has not modified the Mortgage in any
          material respect; satisfied, cancelled or subordinated such Mortgage
          in whole or in part; released the related Mortgaged Property in whole
          or in part from the lien of such Mortgage; or executed any instrument
          of release, cancellation, modification or satisfaction with respect
          thereto.

     (11) A lender's policy of title insurance together with a condominium
          endorsement and extended coverage endorsement, if applicable, in an
          amount at least equal to the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of each
          such Mortgage Loan or a commitment (binder) to issue the same was
          effective on the date of the origination of each Mortgage Loan, each
          such policy is valid and remains in full force and effect.

     (12) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, all of the improvements which
          were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of
          the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building
          restriction lines of such property, and no improvements on adjoining
          properties encroach upon the Mortgaged Property, unless such failure
          to be wholly within such boundaries and restriction lines or such
          encroachment, as the case may be, does not have a material effect on
          the value of such Mortgaged Property.

     (13) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, as of the date of origination
          of each Mortgage Loan, no improvement located on or being part of the
          Mortgaged Property is in violation of any applicable zoning law or
          regulation unless such violation would not have a material adverse
          effect on the value of the related Mortgaged Property. To the best of
          the Seller's knowledge, all inspections,

                                       B-2

<PAGE>

          licenses and certificates required to be made or issued with respect
          to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property and, with respect
          to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not limited to
          certificates of occupancy and fire underwriting certificates, have
          been made or obtained from the appropriate authorities, unless the
          lack thereof would not have a material adverse effect on the value of
          such Mortgaged Property.

     (14) The Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage are genuine, and each is
          the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof,
          enforceable in accordance with its terms and under applicable law.

     (15) The proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there
          is no requirement for future advances thereunder.

     (16) The related Mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions
          which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate
          for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of
          the security, including, (i) in the case of a Mortgage designated as a
          deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii) otherwise by judicial
          foreclosure.

     (17) With respect to each Mortgage constituting a deed of trust, a trustee,
          duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been
          properly designated and currently so serves and is named in such
          Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the
          holder of the Mortgage to the trustee under the deed of trust, except
          in connection with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor.

     (18) At the Cut-off Date, the improvements upon each Mortgaged Property are
          covered by a valid and existing hazard insurance policy with a
          generally acceptable carrier that provides for fire and extended
          coverage and coverage for such other hazards as are customarily
          required by institutional single family mortgage lenders in the area
          where the Mortgaged Property is located, and the Seller has received
          no notice that any premiums due and payable thereon have not been
          paid; the Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain all
          such insurance including flood insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and
          expense. Anything to the contrary in this item (17) notwithstanding,
          no breach of this item (17) shall be deemed to give rise to any
          obligation of the Seller to repurchase or substitute for such affected
          Mortgage Loan or Loans so long as the Seller maintains a blanket
          policy.

     (19) If at the time of origination of each Mortgage Loan, related the
          Mortgaged Property was in an area then identified in the Federal
          Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special
          flood hazards, a flood insurance policy in a form meeting the
          then-current requirements of the Flood Insurance Administration is in
          effect with respect to such Mortgaged Property with a generally
          acceptable carrier.

                                       B-3

<PAGE>

     (20) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, there is no proceeding pending
          or threatened for the total or partial condemnation of any Mortgaged
          Property, nor is such a proceeding currently occurring.

     (21) To best of the Seller's knowledge, there is no material event which,
          with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any
          grace or cure period, would constitute a material non-monetary
          default, breach, violation or event of acceleration under the Mortgage
          or the related Mortgage Note; and the Seller has not waived any
          material non-monetary default, breach, violation or event of
          acceleration.

     (22) Any leasehold estate securing a Mortgage Loan has a stated term at
          least as long as the term of the related Mortgage Loan.

     (23) Each Mortgage Loan was selected from among the outstanding
          adjustable-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans in the Seller's
          portfolio at the Closing Date as to which the representations and
          warranties made with respect to the Mortgage Loans set forth in this
          Schedule B can be made. No such selection was made in a manner
          intended to adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders.

     (24) The Mortgage Loans provide for the full amortization of the amount
          financed over a series of monthly payments.

     (25) At origination, substantially all of the Mortgage Loans in the
          Mortgage Pools had stated terms to maturity of 30 years.

     (26) Scheduled monthly payments made by the Mortgagors on the Mortgage
          Loans either earlier or later than their Due Dates will not affect the
          amortization schedule or the relative application of the payments to
          principal and interest.

     (27) The Mortgage Loans may be prepaid at any time by the related
          Mortgagors without penalty.

     (28) Substantially all of the Mortgage Loans are jumbo mortgage loans that
          have Stated Principal Balances at origination that exceed the then
          applicable limitations for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

     (29) Each Mortgage Loan in Pool I, Pool II and Pool III was originated on
          or after August 22, 2002, May 8, 2002 and June 26, 2002, respectively.

     (30) The latest stated maturity date of any Mortgage Loan in Pool I, Pool
          II and Pool III is February 1, 2033. The earliest stated maturity of
          any Mortgage Loan in Pool I is September 1, 2032. The earliest stated
          maturity date of any Mortgage Loan in Pool II is June 1, 2032. The
          earliest stated maturity date of any Mortgage Loan in Pool III is July
          1, 2032.

     (31) No Mortgage Loan was delinquent more than 30 days as of the Cut-off
          Date.

                                       B-4

<PAGE>

     (32) No Mortgage Loan had a Loan-to-Value Ratio at origination of more than
          95%. Generally, each Mortgage Loan with a Loan-to-Value Ratio at
          origination of greater than 80% is covered by a Primary Insurance
          Policy issued by a mortgage insurance company that is acceptable to
          Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

     (33) Each Mortgage Loan constitutes a "qualified mortgage" within the
          meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code.
