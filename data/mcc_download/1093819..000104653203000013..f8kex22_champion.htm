Chairman &amp; CFO Resign As Initial Stage of Restructuring</B></U></FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Miami January 21, 2003
C</B> An investment group lead by long-time South Florida investor, Marshall
Kanner, has acquired a controlling interest in ChampionLyte Products, Inc.
(OTCBB:CPLY). Kanner&#146;s group purchased all of the convertible preferred
stock from U.S. Bancorp which represents approximately 43 percent of the fully
diluted common shares of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As part of the initial
phase of a major restructuring, new management has accepted the resignations of
former Chairman and CEO, Alan Posner, and Chief Financial Officer and director
Chris Valleau. The Company has retained former Company President, Mark
Streisfield as vice president of sales. He will remain a board member. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>ChampionLyte Products, Inc
is the exclusive manufacturer and distributor of ChampionLyte&lt;-1-226&gt;, the
first completely sugar-free entry into isotonic sports drink market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recently reformulated the sports drink with the sweetener Splenda&#174;,
the trade name for Sucralose produced by McNeil Nutritionals, a Johnson &amp;
Johnson company. ChampionLyte&#174; will continue to have no label warnings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We believe there is
potential to capture both retail and institutional sales at various
levels,&#148; said Kanner. &#147;But first, we need to completely restructure
the Company specifically to acquire operational, sales, manufacturing and
distribution efficiencies&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Kanner said his group has
already severely cut overhead and is currently negotiating with the
Company&#146;s various creditors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We have an excellent
product with the framework of a sales and distribution system,&#148; Kanner
added. &#147;We intend on bringing aboard industry professionals on an as needed
basis to streamline all facets of the Company. Our goal is to accelerate our
sales efforts to a variety of outlets, both retail and institutional, that have
the capacity to put the Company in a cash-flow positive situation as quickly and
cost efficiently as possible.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;For consumers who are
conscientious about diet and exercise, ChampionLyte&#174; is a great tasting
thirst-quenching beverage which replaces electrolytes without the negatives of
sugar sweetened drinks,&#148; added Kanner. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The major advantage of
ChampionLyte&#174; is that it replaces electrolytes, especially after exercise,
without the ingredients, which would cause weight, gain - particularly sugar.
For example: if a man or woman runs on a treadmill for 30 minutes they would
burn about 150 calories. By drinking one of the popular major brand sports
drinks that contain 33 to 37 grams of sugar (that=s 33 to 37 individual one-gram
packs of sugar) after working out on the treadmill, they would either cancel out
the calories they just burned off, or actually gain more calories than burned
during the workout. </FONT></P>
