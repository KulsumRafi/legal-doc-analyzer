related transactions, if, immediately after giving effect to such transaction, any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used for purposes of Sections&nbsp;13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act,
whether or not applicable) (other than an Excluded Person) is or becomes the "beneficial owner," directly or indirectly, or more than 40% of the total voting power in the aggregate normally entitled
to vote in the election of directors, managers, or trustees, as applicable, of the transferee or surviving entity, (ii)&nbsp;any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used for purposes of
Sections&nbsp;13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable) (other than an Excluded Person) is or becomes the "beneficial owner," directly or indirectly, of more than 40% of the
total voting power in the aggregate normally entitled to vote in elections of directors of the Company, or (iii)&nbsp;during any period of 12 consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of
any such 12-month period constituted the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any new directors whose elections by such Board or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of the
Company was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously
so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company then in office. In no event will a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred, with respect to the
Executive, if the Executive is part of a purchasing group that consummates the Change of Control transaction. The Executive will be deemed "part of a purchasing group" for purposes of the preceding
sentence if the Executive is an equity participant in the purchasing company or group (except: (i)&nbsp;passive ownership of less than two percent (2%) of the stock of the purchasing company; or

certified public accounting firm used for auditing purposes by the Company immediately prior to the Executive's employment termination (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and the Executive. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and

a result of the uncertainty in the application of Code Sections&nbsp;280G and 4999 at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is
possible that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or other agency will claim that a greater or lesser Excise Tax is due. In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to be less than the
amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined,
the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes
imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal, state or local income or employment tax
deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the rate provided in Code Section&nbsp;1274(b)(2)(B). In the event that the Excise Tax is
determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time
of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such
excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments. </FONT></P>

Executive recognizes and acknowledges that he will have access to certain confidential information of the Company, including but not limited to, trade secrets,
customer lists, sales records, future casino development plans and other proprietary commercial information, and that such information constitutes valuable, special and unique property of the Company.
The Executive agrees that he will not, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, during or after the term of his employment, disclose any of such confidential information to any party without express
authorization of the Company, except as necessary in the ordinary course of performing his duties hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive agrees with the Company that during the term of his employment with the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company) and for a period of one (1)
year following the termination of his employment with the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company), he will not, without prior written consent of the Company, engage directly or
indirectly in any business (either financially or as a shareholder, employee, officer, partner, independent contractor or owner, or in any other capacity calling for the rendition of personal service
or acts of management, operation or control) which owns, operates or manages casinos, bingo parlors, gaming facilities or other businesses competitive with the Company within the Territory (as
hereinafter defined); provided, however, that Executive may own up to three percent (3%) of any class of securities of a corporation engaged in such a competitive business if such securities are
listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. </FONT></P>

interests of the Company and that he
is one of the principal executives of the Company and conversant with its affairs, its trade secrets, its customers and other proprietary information. The Executive acknowledges that a breach of his
agreements in paragraphs 11(a) and 11(b) hereof will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and the business of the Company, for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and
agrees that in the event of any breach of the aforesaid agreements in paragraphs 11(a) and 11(b), the Company and its successors and assigns shall be entitled to injunctive relief of 50% of the
Executive's annual Base Salary and to such other and further relief as may be proper. The Executive further agrees that in the event of any breach of the agreement in paragraph 11(c), the Company and
