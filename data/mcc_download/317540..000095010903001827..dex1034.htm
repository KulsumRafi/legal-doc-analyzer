writing the Forecast within 30 days of Company&#146;s receipt of the Forecast from Bottler, the Forecast will be deemed approved by Company and become the Approved Forecast. If Company does not approve in writing any proposed amendment to the

Bottler&#146;s acceptance of Company&#146;s quotations will establish the price and the quantity for delivery hereunder for the affected delivery period. For pricing purposes, the delivery period will be one or more whole calendar months. If Bottler
has not furnished said instructions by 30 days prior to a calendar month, then the price for that month will be as established by Company based on market conditions existing at that time for the quantities to be delivered and the delivery period.
However, if market conditions indicate a delay in pricing, the Company may waive the 30-day requirement. In the event Bottler has not otherwise specified the quantity to be delivered prior to the date that pricing is established, the quantity will

year in which a Charge Notice is delivered. The Services Charge will take effect on and be due and payable beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the year in which a Charge Notice is delivered (or such later date as may be specified
