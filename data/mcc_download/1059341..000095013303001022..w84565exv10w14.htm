<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Executive shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Company and the LLC against any and all

expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and
disbursements) actually incurred by the Executive in connection with any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other) for any action or omission in
his capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or the LLC.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification under this Section&nbsp;4(i) shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution of, any other indemnification by the Company or the LLC of its
officers and directors. Expenses incurred by the Executive in defending an
action, suit or proceeding for which he claims the right to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4(i) shall be paid by the Company or the LLC, as the
case may be, in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon the Company&#146;s or the LLC&#146;s receipt of (x)&nbsp;a written affirmation
by the Executive of his good faith belief that the standard of conduct
necessary for his indemnification hereunder and under the provisions of
applicable law has been met and (y)&nbsp;a written undertaking by or on behalf of
the Executive to repay the amount advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
by a court that the Executive engaged in conduct, including fraud, theft,
misfeasance, or malfeasance against the Company or the LLC, which precludes
indemnification under the provisions of such applicable law. Such written
undertaking in clause (y)&nbsp;shall be
accepted by the Company or the LLC, as the case may be, without security
therefor and without reference to the financial ability of the Executive to
make repayment thereunder.

<P><FONT size="2">The Company and the LLC shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain in effect for the Term of this Agreement a
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policy, with a policy limit of at
least $25,000,000, subject to customary exclusions, with respect to claims made
against officers and directors of the Company or the LLC; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
the Company or the LLC, as the case may be, shall be relieved of this
obligation to maintain directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company or the LLC, it cannot be obtained at a

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term will terminate immediately upon the Executive&#146;s death,
Disability, or, upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice by the Company, in
the case of a Determination of Disability. As used herein the term
&#147;Disability&#148; means the Executive&#146;s inability to perform his duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement for a period of more than 120 consecutive
days, or for more than 180&nbsp;days, whether or not continuous, during any 365-day
period, due to physical or mental incapacity or impairment. A &#147;Determination
of Disability&#148; shall occur when a physician, reasonably satisfactory to both
the Executive and the Company and paid for by the Company or the LLC, finds
that the Executive will likely be unable to perform his duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement for the above-specified period due to a
physical or mental incapacity or impairment. Such decision shall be final and
binding on the Executive and the Company; provided that if they cannot agree as
to a physician, then each shall select and pay for a physician and these two
together shall select a third physician whose fee shall be borne equally by the
Executive and either the Company or the LLC and whose Determination of
Disability shall be binding on the Executive and the Company. Should the
Executive become incapacitated, his employment shall continue and all base and
other compensation due the Executive hereunder shall continue to be paid
through the date upon which the Executive&#146;s employment is terminated for
Disability or Determination of Disability in accordance with this section.

should have been made (&#147;Underpayment&#148;), or that Gross-Up Payments will
have been made by the Company which should not have been made
(&#147;Overpayments&#148;). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has
occurred. In the case of an Underpayment, the amount of such
Underpayment (together with any interest and penalties payable by the
Executive as a result of such Underpayment) shall be promptly paid by the

Overpayment, provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the Executive shall not in any

recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities and (ii)
