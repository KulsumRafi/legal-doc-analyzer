same meanings as defined in the Credit Agreement.

Except as expressly amended hereby, or as may have been previously amended, the
Credit Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the
original terms thereof.

The amendments herein contained are limited specifically to the matters set
forth above and do not constitute directly or by implication an amendment or
waiver of any other provision of Credit Agreement or any default which may occur
or may have occurred under the Credit Agreement.

The Companies, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant that (a)
after giving effect to this Amendment, each of the representations and
warranties of the Companies set forth in the Credit Agreement are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof as if made on and

warranties relate to an earlier date in which case they shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (b) after giving
effect to this Amendment, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute
but one Amendment.  This Amendment shall become effective when duly executed
counterparts hereof which, when taken

delivered to the Administrative Agent.

This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document.

THIS AMENDMENT SHALL GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
