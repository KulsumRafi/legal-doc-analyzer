                             RENEWAL PROMISSORY NOTE

$635,506.14                                     Effective as of October 25, 2002
                                                                  Tampa, Florida

     1. Promise to Pay. SHELLS OF MELBOURNE JOINT VENTURE, a general partnership
("Maker"), whose address is 16313 North Dale Mabry Highway, Suite 100, Tampa,
Florida 33618, for value received, promises to pay to the order of COLONIAL
BANK, an Alabama banking corporation, successor by merger to MANUFACTURERS BANK
OF FLORIDA ("Bank"), at 400 North Tampa Street, Suite 2500, Tampa, Florida
33602, or at such other place as the holder of this Renewal Promissory Note
designates in writing to Maker, the principal amount of Six Hundred Thirty-Five
Thousand Five Hundred Six and 14/100ths Dollars ($635,506.14), together with
interest as required under this Renewal Promissory Note (the "Note").

     2. Interest Rate. Maker shall pay interest on the outstanding principal
amount of this Note at an annual rate (the "Interest Rate") equal to the
Colonial Bank Base Rate (as hereinafter defined), floating on a daily basis. The
term "Colonial Bank Base Rate" as used herein shall mean the rate of interest
per annum as reported from time to time by the Bank (or such other source for
determining the base rate of interest as may hereafter be selected by Bank) as
its base rate of interest, and shall not necessarily mean or imply that such
base rate of interest is the lowest or most favorable rate of interest then
available from Bank to specific borrowers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Maker
shall have the right, at any time during the term of this Note, to adjust the
Interest Rate to a fixed rate by giving written notice thereof to Maker at least
thirty (30) days prior to any monthly payment date. In the event Maker shall
deliver written notice to Bank of its intention to adjust the Interest Rate to a
fixed rate as described above, then the "Interest Rate" under this Note shall be
adjusted, upon the applicable payment date, to a fixed rate which is equal to
the prevailing market rate for loans of similar size and borrowers of similar
credit status, as determined by Bank in its sole discretion.

     3. Payments. Commencing on the 25th day of November, 2002, and continuing
monthly on the 25th day of each and every month thereafter, through and
including September 25, 2007, Maker shall make a payment of principal in the
amount of Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($3,900.00), plus interest in an
amount equal to the accrued and unpaid interest hereunder. A final payment of
all outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest shall be due and payable
in full on October 25,2007.

THIS INSTRUMENT EVIDENCES A RENEWAL OF AN OBLIGATION AND IS EXEMPT FROM TAXATION
PURSUANT TO RULE 12B-4.054 F.A.C. THERE IS NO NEW OBLIGOR. EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT
OF DOCUMENTARY STAMP TAXES AND INTANGIBLE TAX IN THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY LAW ON
THE OBLIGATIONS RENEWED BY THIS INSTRUMENT CAN BE FOUND ON THE MORTGAGE AND
SECURITY AGREEMENT RECORDED AT OFFICIAL RECORDS BOOK 4101, PAGE 378, OF THE
PUBLIC RECORDS OF BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA.

<PAGE>

     4. Application and Form of Payments. Payments will be applied first to
accrued interest and then to principal, and all interest on this Note will be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year.
Payments of interest and principal must be made in such coin or currency of the
United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts. Payments received after 2:00 p.m. will be
treated as being received on the next banking day.

     5. Prepayment, Late Fee, Interest on Default, and Maximum Interest. Maker
may prepay all or any portion of this Note without premium or penalty. Maker
shall give Bank one day's prior written notice of any prepayment. Partial
prepayments will be applied against required principal installments in the
inverse order of their maturities. Therefore, partial prepayments will not
affect the due date of any required installments under this Note until this Note
is paid in full. Maker agrees to pay a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of
any payment due hereunder that is not paid within ten (10) days of the date the
payment is due. Interest on all amounts not paid when due after maturity,
acceleration, or otherwise, will accrue and will be payable at the rate which is
five percent (5%) above the Interest Rate, but in no event higher than the
maximum rate of interest allowed by applicable law.

     6. Security. This Note is secured, inter alia, by a Mortgage and Security
Agreement dated November 30, 1999, recorded in Official Records Book 4101, at
Page 378, of the Public Records of Brevard County, Florida, as the same has been
amended by that certain Modification to Mortgage and Security Agreement dated
the date of this Note, made by Maker for the benefit of Bank (collectively, the
"Mortgage") and by any and all collateral presently and hereafter held by Bank
from Maker and given or agreed to be given to Bank by Maker, plus any and all
collateral presently or hereafter held by Bank given or agreed to be given by
any third party or parties for the benefit of Maker hereof.

     7. Default and Remedies. The occurrence of any of the following events
constitutes a "Default" (in the following provisions, the term "Guarantor"
refers jointly and severally to any person or entity that previously has
guaranteed or either currently or in the future guarantees the repayment of this
Note):

          (a) The nonpayment within five (5) days after delivery of a written
     notice to Maker that it is due and payable of any interest or principal
     under (i) this Note or (ii) that certain Promissory Note dated the same
     date as this Note, in the original principal amount of Six Hundred
     Sixty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($667,500.00), made by Shells
     Seafood Restaurants, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to the order of Bank
     (the "Winter Haven Note"), or the nonpayment any other liability,
     obligation, or indebtedness owing from Maker to Bank, whether at maturity,
     by acceleration, or otherwise (provided however, that Bank shall have no
     obligation to provide written notice of the nonpayment of any principal or
     interest under this Note more than twice during any calendar year, and
     thereafter Bank shall have no further obligation to provide any such notice
     during the remainder of the applicable calendar year and nonpayment when
     due of any such sums shall be a default hereunder);

          (b) A material breach by Maker or Guarantor of any material
     representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Note or any other
     agreement between Maker or

                                       2

<PAGE>

     Guarantor and Bank, where said breach shall continue for a period of thirty
     (30) days after delivery of written notice thereof to Maker;

          (c) The occurrence of a default under the Mortgage or under any other
     agreement given by Maker or Guarantor to Bank as security for the
     indebtedness evidenced hereby (subject to applicable grace and cure periods
     contained therein, if any).

     Upon the occurrence of a Default and at any time thereafter during the
continuance of a Default, Bank, at its option and as often as it desires, may
declare all liabilities, obligations, and indebtedness due Bank, including this
Note and the Winter Haven Note, to be immediately due and payable without
demand, notice, or presentment, and may exercise any other remedy available to
it under the Mortgage or any other agreement given by Maker or Guarantor to
Bank, and any other remedy available to it at law or in equity.

     8. Payment of Costs. Maker shall pay all costs incurred by the holder of
this Note in enforcing or collecting this Note and enforcing each agreement
executed in connection with this Note (including the Mortgage or any other
agreement under which real or personal property is pledged as security for this
Note), including without limitation all reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and
expenses incurred in all matters of interpretation, enforcement, and collection,
before, during, and after demand, suit, proceeding, trial, appeal, and
post-judgment collection efforts as well as all costs and fees incurred by the
holder of this Note in connection with any bankruptcy, reorganization, or
similar proceeding (including efforts to obtain relief from any stay) if Maker
or any other person or entity liable for the indebtedness represented by this
Note becomes involved in any bankruptcy, reorganization, or similar proceeding.

     9. Waiver and Consents. Maker and every other person liable at any time for
payment of this Note waives presentment, protest, notice of protest, and notice
of dishonor. Maker expressly consents to all extensions and renewals of this
Note (as a whole or in part) and all delays in time or payment or other
performance under this Note that the holder of this Note grants at any time and
from time to time, without limitation and without any notice to or further
consent of Maker. Maker agrees that its obligations under this Note are
independent of the obligation of any other maker, guarantor or other person or
entity that now or later is obligated to pay this Note. Maker also agrees that
Bank may release any security for or any other obligor of this Note or waive,
extend, alter, amend, or modify this Note or otherwise take any action that
varies the risk of Maker without releasing or discharging Maker from Maker's
obligation to repay this Note.

     10. Venue. Maker and Bank agree that venue for each action, suit, or other
legal proceeding arising under or relating to this Note or any agreement
securing or related to this Note shall be the County Court or Circuit Court
located in Hillsborough County, Florida, or the Federal District Court for the
Middle District of Florida, Hillsborough County, Florida, and Maker and Bank
hereby waive any right to sue or be sued in any other county in Florida or any
other state, unless it shall be lawfully required that any such action, suit or
other legal proceeding have venue elsewhere.

     11. Savings Clause. Nothing herein, nor any transaction related hereto,
shall be construed or so operated as to require Maker to pay interest at a
greater rate than shall be lawful.

                                       3

<PAGE>

Should any interest or other charges paid by Maker in connection with the loan
evidenced by this Note result in the computation or earning of interest in
excess of the maximum contract rate of interest which is legally permitted under
applicable Florida law or Federal preemption statutes, if Bank shall elect a
benefit thereof, then any and all such excess shall be, and the same is, hereby
waived by Bank, and any and all such excess shall be automatically credited
against and in reduction of the balance due under this Note and any portion
which exceeds the balance due under this Note shall be paid by Bank to Maker.

     12. Waiver of Jury Trial. BY THE EXECUTION HEREOF, MAKER HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY AGREES THAT NEITHER MAKER NOR ANY ASSIGNEE,
SUCCESSOR, HEIR, OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF MAKER SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN
ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM, OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE ARISING
FROM OR BASED UPON THIS NOTE, THE MORTGAGE, OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
EVIDENCING, SECURING, OR RELATING TO THE INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED BY THIS NOTE OR
TO THE DEALINGS OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO. NEITHER
MAKER NOR BANK WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS NOT OR CAN NOT
BE WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY NEGOTIATED BY THE
PARTIES HERETO, AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTION. NEITHER
MAKER NOR BANK HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.
THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR BANK TO ENTER INTO THIS
TRANSACTION.

     13. Modification. This Note may not be modified or terminated orally, but
only by agreement or discharge in writing and signed by Bank. Any forbearance of
Bank in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, under the Mortgage or under
any other loan document relating to this transaction shall not be a waiver of or
preclude the exercise of any right or remedy. Acceptance by Bank of payment of
any sum payable hereunder after the due date of such payment shall not be a
waiver of Bank's right to either require prompt payment when due of all other
sums payable hereunder or to declare a default for the failure to make prompt
payment in the future.

     14. Successors and Assigns. Whenever Bank is referred to in this Note, such
reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of Bank,
including, without limitation, any subsequent assignee or holder of this Note,
and all covenants, provisions, and all agreements by or on behalf of Maker and
any endorsers, guarantors, and sureties hereof which are contained herein shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Bank.

     15. Corrective Documentation. For and in consideration of the funding or
renewal of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, Maker further agrees to cooperate
with Bank and to reexecute any and all documentation relating to the loan
evidenced by this Note which is deemed necessary or desirable in Bank's
reasonable discretion, in order to correct or adjust any clerical errors or
omissions contained in any document executed in connection with the loan
evidenced by this Note.
