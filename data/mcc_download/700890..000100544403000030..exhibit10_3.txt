all Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights and use their best efforts to obtain any
consents, waivers or agreements necessary to enable Secured Party to exercise
its remedies with respect to the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights. Debtors
represent and warrant to Secured Party that the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Debtors will not violate or cause a default
under any of the Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights or any agreement in
connection therewith.

                  (i) Debtors shall notify Secured Party immediately if
they know or have reason to know that any application or registration relating
to any Patent, Trademark or Copyright (now or hereafter existing) may become
abandoned or dedicated, or of any adverse determination or development
(including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any
proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States
Copyright Office or any court) regarding Debtors' ownership of any Patent,
Trademark or Copyright, their right to register the same, or to keep and
maintain the same.

                  (ii)  Debtors shall provide (on a monthly basis) a list
to Secured Party of all filings of applications for the registration of any
Patent, Trademark or Copyright with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency, and,
upon request of Secured Party, Debtors shall execute and deliver any and all
Patent Security Agreements, Copyright Security Agreements or Trademark Security
Agreements as Secured Party may request to evidence Secured Party's Lien on such
Patent, Trademark or Copyright, and the General Intangibles of Debtors relating
thereto or represented thereby.

                  (iii)Debtors shall take all actions necessary or
requested by Secured Party to maintain and pursue each application, to obtain
the relevant registration and to maintain the registration of each of the
Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights (now or hereafter existing), including the

noncontestability and opposition and interference and cancellation proceedings.

or Copyright Collateral is infringed upon, or misappropriated or diluted by a
third party, Debtors shall notify Secured Party promptly after Debtors learn
thereof. Debtors shall, unless their Boards of Directors reasonably determine
that such Patent, Trademark or Copyright Collateral is in no way material to the
conduct of the Debtors' business or operations or unless its Board shall
otherwise determine that such lawsuit is not in the best interests of the
Debtors, promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to
recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution,
and shall take such other actions as Secured Party shall deem appropriate under
the circumstances to protect such Patent, Trademark or Copyright Collateral.

                  (v) Debtors shall notify Secured Party of all new

hereafter acquired), including any licensing or exploitation of any Intellectual
Property, within 10 days of entering into such arrangement or Contract.

rights of Secured Party in the Collateral. Debtors assume all liability and
responsibility in connection with the Collateral acquired by it, and the
liability of Debtors to pay the Secured Obligations shall in no way be affected

damaged, or for any reason whatsoever unavailable to Debtors.

6.8 Taxes and Claims. Debtors will pay when due all property and other
taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed upon, and all claims
against, the Collateral (including claims for labor, materials and supplies);

contesting the same in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted
and diligently conducted and if Debtors have established such reserve or other
appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP; and
provided further that the same can be contested without risk of loss or
forfeiture or material impairment of the Collateral or the use thereof.

                                       10

time to time upon request, statements and schedules further identifying and
describing the Collateral and such other information, reports and evidence
concerning the Collateral (and in particular the Intellectual Property) as
Secured Party may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

6.10 Use of Collateral. Debtors will not use or permit any Collateral to
be used unlawfully or in violation of any provision of applicable law, or any
policy of insurance covering any of the Collateral.

6.11  Records of Collateral. Debtors shall, at their own cost and expense,
keep full and accurate books and records relating to the Collateral (including a

records in such manner as Secured Party may reasonably request indicating that
the Collateral is subject to the Security Interests.

6.12 Federal Claims. Debtors shall notify Secured Party of any Collateral
which constitutes a claim against the United States government or any
instrumentality or agency thereof, the assignment of which claim is restricted

Intangible, Debtors will save, indemnify and keep Secured Party harmless from
and against all expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),

recoupment or reduction of liability whatsoever of the obligor thereunder,
arising out of a breach by Debtors of any obligation thereunder or arising out
of any other agreement, indebtedness or liability at any time owing to, or in
favor of, such obligor or its successors from Debtors, except in the case of
Secured Party, to the extent such expense, loss, or damage is attributable
solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured Party as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (but, in any case, Secured Party

consequential damages). All such obligations of Debtors shall be and remain
enforceable against and only against Debtors and shall not be enforceable
against Secured Party.

against  Debtors if Debtors do not defend such suit,  action or proceeding or if
Attorney  believes  that Debtors are not pursuing  such defense in a manner that
will  maximize the recovery to Attorney,  and settle,  compromise  or adjust any
suit, action, or proceeding described above and, in connection  therewith,  give
such discharges or releases as Attorney may deem appropriate;

         (f) to pay or  discharge  taxes  or  Liens  levied  or  placed  upon or

verifications of such accounts as Attorney may request; and

         (k)  generally  to sell,  transfer,  pledge,  make any  agreement  with
respect to or otherwise  deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely
as though Secured Party were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to
do, at Secured Party's option and Debtors' expense,  at any time or from time to
time,  all acts and things  that  Secured  Party  deems  necessary  to  protect,
preserve or realize upon the Collateral;  provided, however, that nothing herein

                                       12
<PAGE>

contained  shall be construed as requiring or  obligating  Secured Party to make
any  demand,  or to make any  inquiry  as to the  nature or  sufficiency  of any
payment  received  by it, or to  present or file any claim or notice or take any
action with respect to any of the  Collateral  or the money due or to become due
thereunder or the property covered thereby, and no action taken or omitted to be
taken by Secured Party with respect to any of the Collateral  shall give rise to
any  defense,  counterclaim  or  setoff in favor of  Debtors  or to any claim or
action against Secured Party.


         7.2 None of Secured Party or its affiliates,  agents or representatives
shall be responsible to Debtors for any act or failure to act under any power of
attorney or otherwise, except in respect of damages attributable solely to their
own gross negligence or willful  misconduct as finally  determined by a court of
competent   jurisdiction,   nor  for  any  punitive,   exemplary,   indirect  or
consequential  damages.  Debtors,  to the extent  permitted  by law,  ratify and
confirm  all  acts  taken  by  Secured  Party  as such  attorney-in-fact  or its
substitutes by virtue of the power of attorney contained in this Section 7. This
power,  being coupled with an interest,  is irrevocable until this Agreement has
been terminated and the Secured Obligations have been fully satisfied.

SECTION 8.        Transfers and Other Liens

         Except as otherwise permitted in this Section 8, Debtors shall not:

(a)  sell, lease, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise
dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, any of the Collateral, except
in the ordinary course of business; provided, that in no event shall Debtors
sell, lease, assign, license, sub-license or otherwise transfer or dispose of
its right, title and interest in the Intellectual Property.

(b)  create, permit or suffer to exist, and will defend the Collateral
against, and take such other action as is necessary to remove, any Lien on the
Collateral, and will defend the right, title and interest of Secured Party in
and to any of Debtors' rights under the Collateral against the claims and
demands of all Persons whomsoever.

SECTION 9.        Remedies

(a) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all
other rights and remedies provided for herein, under the Note, under the other
Transaction Documents or any rights and remedies otherwise available to it, all
the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code (whether or
not the Code applies to the affected Collateral) and also may: (i) require
Debtors to, and Debtors hereby agrees that it will, at its expense and upon
request of Secured Party forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as
directed by Secured Party and make it available to Secured Party at any place or
places designated by Secured Party in which event Debtors shall at their own
expense: (A) forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places so
designated by Secured Party and thereby delivered to Secured Party, (B) store
and keep any Collateral so delivered to Secured Party at such place or places
pending further action by Secured Party, and (C) while Collateral shall be so
stored and kept, provide such guards and maintenance services as shall be
necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain the Collateral in
good condition; and (ii)without notice except as specified below, sell, lease or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels
at public or private sale, and without the necessity of gathering at the place
of sale of the property to be sold, at any of the Secured Party's offices or
elsewhere, at such time or times, for cash, on credit or for future delivery,
and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as Secured Party may deem
commercially reasonable. Debtors agree that, to the extent notice of sale shall
be required by law, at least ten (10) days notice to Debtors of the time and
place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made
shall constitute reasonable notification. At any sale of the Collateral, if
permitted by law, Secured Party may bid (which bid may be, in whole or in part,
in the form of cancellation of indebtedness) for the purchase of the Collateral
or any portion thereof for the account of Secured Party. Secured Party shall not
be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having
been given. Secured Party may adjourn any public or private sale from time to
time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefore, and such sale may,
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Debtors waive all
claims, damages, and demands against Secured Party arising out of the
repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral except such as arise solely
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured Party as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

                                       13
<PAGE>

         (b) Upon the  occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of an Event of
Default,  Secured Party or its attorneys  shall have the right without notice or
demand or legal process  (unless the same shall be required by applicable  law),
personally,  or by Secured Party's  attorneys,  to collect,  receive,  assemble,
process,  appropriate and realize upon the Collateral,  or any part thereof, and
may forthwith sell,  lease,  assign,  give an option or options to purchase,  or
sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or contract to do so),
or any part  thereof,  in one or more  parcels  at a public or  private  sale or
sales, at any exchange at such prices as it may deem acceptable,  for cash or on
credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, and Secured
Party in connection  therewith shall have the right to (i) to enter upon, occupy
and use any  premises  owned or leased by  Debtors  or where the  Collateral  is
located (or is believed to be located) until the Secured Obligations are paid in
full without any  obligation  to pay rent to Debtors,  to render the  Collateral
useable or saleable and to remove the  Collateral or any part thereof there from
to the  premises of Secured  Party for such time as Secured  Party may desire in
order to  effectively  collect or liquidate the Collateral and use in connection
with  such  removal  any and all  services,  supplies  and other  facilities  of
Debtors;  and (ii) to take possession of Debtors' original books and records, to
obtain  access to Debtors'  data  processing  equipment,  computer  hardware and
software  relating to the  Collateral  and to use all of the  foregoing  and the
information  contained  therein in any manner  Secured Party deems  appropriate.
Secured  Party  shall have the right upon any such  public sale or sales and, to
the extent  permitted by law,  upon any such private sale or sales,  to purchase
for the benefit of Secured  Party,  the whole or any part of said  Collateral so
sold,  free of any right or equity of  redemption,  which  equity of  redemption
Debtors hereby releases.  Such sales may be adjourned and continued from time to
time with or without notice.

         (c)  Debtors acknowledge and agree that a breach of any of the
covenants contained in Sections 5, 6 and 8 hereof will cause irreparable injury
to Secured Party and that Secured Party has no adequate remedy at law in respect
of such breaches and therefore agrees, without limiting the right of Secured
Party to seek and obtain specific performance of other obligations of Debtors
contained in this Agreement, that the covenants of Debtors contained in the
Sections referred to in this Section shall be specifically enforceable against
Debtors.

         (d) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Debtors
hereby waive presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Security
Agreement or any Collateral.

         (e) In the event that Secured Party forecloses upon and takes
title to all or substantially all of the Collateral pursuant to this Section 9,
Secured Party will, for a period of five (5) years from the date Secured Party
acquires title to the Collateral, pay to CITA an amount equal to three percent
(3%) of Secured Party's net pre-tax profits, if any, realized from selling,
licensing or otherwise exploiting the Collateral, less the outstanding amount of
any unpaid Secured Obligations including any attorney fees or other expenses
incurred by Secured Party, after deduction of all direct, indirect and allocated
costs and expenses incurred by Secured Party, in its sole and absolute
discretion, in exploiting the Collateral and operating its business. Such net
amount, if any, shall be payable annually in arrears, within ninety (90) days of
the end of Secured Party's fiscal year. Nothing provided for herein shall create
any obligations from Secured Party to Debtors except as expressly stated herein,
or in any way obligate Secured Party to exploit or sell the Collateral,
reasonably or at all. If Secured Party sells or makes any type of transfer of
all or substantially all of the Collateral to a newly-formed public corporation,
Secured Party will cause such corporation to agree to grant to CITA three
percent (3%) of its common stock, subject to any agreement by which other
shareholders are bound. Upon the issuance of such shares, any and all payment
obligations under this Section shall immediately terminate. Debtors represent
and warrant that they are sophisticated and "accredited" investors, fully
understand the risks and other information associated with such shares, and that
CITA will be acquiring the shares for its own account and not with a view toward
resale or distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no Debtor shall be entitled to any portion of any revenues or net profits
realized from the sale, transfer, assignment, license or other disposition of
any debt or equity securities of Secured Party, or in any way attributable to
Secured Party's business or operations other than the net pre-tax profits, if
any, realized from Secured Party's exploitation of the Collateral.

SECTION 10.       Assigned Agreements
         If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Debtors hereby
irrevocably authorize and empower Secured Party, without limiting any other
authorizations or empowerments contained in any of the other Transaction
Documents, to assert, either directly or on behalf of Debtors, any claims

                                       14
<PAGE>

Debtors  may have,  from  time to time,  against  any other  party to any of the
agreements  to which  Debtors are a party or to otherwise  exercise any right or
remedy of Debtors under any such agreements (including,  without limitation, the
right to  enforce  directly  against  any  party to any  such  agreement  all of
Debtors' rights thereunder, to make all demands and give all notices and to make
all requests required or permitted to be made by Debtors thereunder).

SECTION 11.       Limitation on Duty of Secured Party with Respect to Collateral

         Secured Party shall use reasonable care with respect to the Collateral
in its possession or under its control. Secured Party shall have no other duty
as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or
control of any agent or nominee of Secured Party, or any income thereon or as to
the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining
thereto. Secured Party shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage
to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason
of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency,
consignee or other Secured Party or bailee selected by Secured Party in good
faith.

SECTION 12.       Application of Proceeds

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part of the
Collateral shall be applied towards payment of the Secured Obligations. Debtors
shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or
disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Secured Obligations,
including any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred by Secured Party to
collect such deficiency.

SECTION 13.       Expenses

         Debtors shall pay all costs, fees and expenses of protecting, storing,
warehousing, appraising, insuring, handling, maintaining and shipping the
Collateral, all costs, fees and expenses of creating, perfecting, maintaining
and enforcing the Security Interests, and any and all excise, property, sales
and use taxes imposed by any federal, state, local or foreign authority on any
of the Collateral, or with respect to periodic appraisals and inspections of the
Collateral, or with respect to the sale or other disposition thereof. If Debtors
fail to promptly pay any portion of the above costs, fees and expenses when due
or to perform any other obligation of Debtors under this Agreement, Secured
Party may, at its option, but shall not be required to, pay or perform the same
and charge Debtors' accounts for all fees, costs and expenses incurred
therefore, and Debtors agree to reimburse Secured Party therefore on demand. All
sums so paid or incurred by Secured Party for any of the foregoing, any and all
other sums for which Debtors may become liable hereunder and all fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees, legal expenses and court costs) incurred by
Secured Party in enforcing or protecting the Security Interests or any of their
rights or remedies under this Agreement shall be payable on demand, shall
constitute Secured Obligations, shall bear interest until paid at the Reference
Rate in effect from time to time, and shall be secured by the Collateral.

SECTION 14.       Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral

         Subject to Section 16, upon payment in full of all Secured Obligations,
the Security Interests and this Agreement shall terminate. Upon such termination
of the Security Interests, Secured Party will, at the expense of Debtors,
execute and deliver to Debtors such documents as Debtors shall reasonably
request to evidence the termination of the Security Interests.

SECTION 15.       Grant Of License To Use Intellectual Property.

         For the purpose of enabling Secured Party to exercise its rights and
remedies under Section 9 hereof (including, without limiting the terms of
Section 9 hereof, in order to take possession of, hold, preserve, process,
assemble, prepare for sale, market for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of
Collateral) at such time as Secured Party shall be lawfully entitled to exercise
such rights and remedies, Debtors hereby grants to Secured Party, for the
benefit of Secured Party, an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable
without payment of royalty or other compensation to Debtors) to use, license or
sublicense any Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by Debtors,
and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to
all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to
all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.

                                       15
<PAGE>

SECTION 16.       Reinstatement.

         This Security Agreement and the Security Interests shall remain in full
force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or
against Debtors for liquidation or reorganization, should Debtors become
insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor or creditors or
should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of
Debtors' assets, and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Secured Obligations,
or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in
amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of the Secured
Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent conveyance," or
otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the
event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or
returned, the Secured Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by
such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

SECTION 17.       Notices

         All notices, approvals, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be given in writing to Debtors at the addresses specified in
Schedule I.

SECTION 18.       Successors and Assigns

         This Agreement and all obligations of Debtors hereunder shall be
binding upon the successors and assigns of Debtors (including any Debtors in
possession on behalf of Debtors) and shall, together with the rights and
remedies of Secured Party, inure to the benefit of Secured Party, all future
holders of any instrument evidencing any of the Secured Obligations and their
respective successors and assigns. No sales of participations, other sales,
assignments, transfers or other dispositions of any agreement governing or
instrument evidencing the Secured Obligations or any portion thereof or interest
therein shall in any manner affect the Security Interests granted to Secured
Party hereunder. Debtors may not assign, sell, hypothecate or otherwise transfer
any interest in or obligation under this Security Agreement.

SECTION 19.       Limitation by Law

         All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Security Agreement may
be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any
applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Security Agreement
are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that
may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they shall
not render this Security Agreement invalid, unenforceable, in whole or in part,
or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any
applicable law.

         SECTION 20.  Governing Law/ Waiver of Jury Trial. In all
respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this
Security Agreement and the obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of
California applicable to contracts made and performed in that state, and any
applicable laws of the United States of America. Debtors hereby consent and
agree that the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, City of
Los Angeles, California, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine
any claims or disputes between debtors and secured party pertaining to this
security agreement or to any matter arising out of or relating to this security
agreement, provided, that Debtors and Secured Party acknowledge that any appeals

                                       16
<PAGE>

from those courts may have to be heard by a court located outside of Los Angeles
County,  and,  provided,  further,  nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or
operate to  preclude  Secured  Party from  bringing  suit or taking  other legal
action in any other  jurisdiction  to  realize  on the  Collateral  or any other
security  for the secured  obligations,  or to enforce a judgment or other court
order in favor of Secured Party. Debtors expressly submit and consent in advance
to such  jurisdiction  in any action or suit  commenced  in any such court,  and
Debtors hereby waive any objection which it may have based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction,  improper venue or forum non conveniens and hereby consents to the
granting  of such legal or  equitable  relief as is deemed  appropriate  by such
court.

         Because   disputes   arising  in  connection  with  complex   financial
transactions  are most quickly and  economically  resolved by an experienced and
expert person and the parties wish  applicable  state and federal laws to apply,
the parties  desire  that  disputes  arising  hereunder  or  relating  hereto be
resolved by a judge applying such  applicable  laws.  Therefore,  to achieve the
best combination of the benefits of the judicial  system,  the Debtors waive all
right to trial by jury in any action,  suit or proceeding brought to resolve any
dispute, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, between secured party
and debtors  arising out of,  connected  with,  related to, or incidental to the
relationship  established in connection with, this Security  Agreement or any of
the other documentation or the transactions related hereto or thereto.


SECTION 20.       Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative

         No failure or delay on the part of Secured Party in the exercise of any
power, right or privilege hereunder shall impair such power, right or privilege
or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude
other or further exercise thereof or any other right, power or privilege. A
waiver by Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion
shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which Secured Party would
otherwise have had on any future occasion. All rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be
in writing signed by Secured Party and Debtors.
