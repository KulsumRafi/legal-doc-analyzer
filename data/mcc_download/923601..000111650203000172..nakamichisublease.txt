all of the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Sublease. Unless
otherwise provided herein, any statement of size set forth in this Sublease, or

a non-compliance with such warranty exists as of the Start Date, or if one of
such systems or elements should malfunction or fail within the appropriate
warranty period, Sublessor shall, as Sublessor's sole obligation with respect to
such matter, except as otherwise provided in this Sublease, promptly after
receipt of written notice from Sublessee setting forth with specificity the

as to the HVAC systems, and (ii) 30 days as to the remaining systems and other
elements. If Sublessee does not give Sublessor the required notice within the
appropriate warranty period, correction of any such non-compliance, malfunction
or failure shall be the obligation of Sublessee at Sublessee's sole cost and
expense.

     2.3 Compliance. Sublessor warrants that any improvements, alterations or
utility installations made or installed by or on behalf of Sublessor to or on
the Premises comply with all applicable covenants or restrictions of record and
applicable building codes, regulations and ordinances ("Applicable

modifications which may be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or
any similar laws as a result of Sublessee's use. NOTE: Sublessee is responsible
for determining whether or not the zoning and other Applicable Requirements are
appropriate for Sublessee's intended use, and acknowledges that past uses of the
Premises may no longer be allowed. If the Premises do not comply with said
warranty, Sublessor shall, except as otherwise provided, promptly after receipt

by Sublessor and/or Brokers to satisfy itself with respect to the condition of
the Premises (including but not limited to the electrical, HVAC and fire
sprinkler systems, security, environmental aspects, and compliance with
Applicable Requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act), and their
suitability for Sublessee's intended use, (b) Sublessee has made such

Sublease (including but not limited to the obligations to pay Sublessee's Share
of Common Area Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes and insurance premiums
and to maintain the Premises) shall, however, be in effect during such period.
Any such early possession shall not affect the Expiration Date.

notwithstanding Sublessor's election to withhold possession pending receipt of

shall occur in the performance of Sublessor's Obligations under the Master
Lease, that Sublessor may receive, collect and enjoy the Rent accruing under
this Sublease. However, if Sublessor shall Default in the performance of its

else liable under the Master Lease shall not be deemed a waiver by Master Lessor
of any provisions of the Master Lease.

subsequent subletting or assignment.

          (d) In the event of any Default of Sublessor under the Master Lease,
Master Lessor may proceed directly against Sublessor, any guarantors or any one
else liable under the Master Lease or this Sublease without first exhausting
Master Lessor's remedies against any other person or entity liable thereon to
Master Lessor.

          (e) Master Lessor may consent to subsequent sublettings and
assignments of the Master Lease or this Sublease or any amendments or
modifications thereto without notifying Sublessor or any one else liable under
the Master Lease and without obtaining their consent and such action shall not
relieve such persons from liability.

          (f) In the event that Sublessor shall Default in its obligations under
the Master Lease, then Master Lessor, at its option and without being obligated
to do so, may require Sublessee to attorn to Master Lessor in which event Master
Lessor shall undertake the obligations of Sublessor under this Sublease from the
time of the exercise of said option to termination of this Sublease but Master
Lessor shall not be liable for any prepaid Rent nor any Security Deposit paid by
Sublessee, nor shall Master Lessor be liable for any other Defaults of the
Sublessor under the Sublease.

          (g) Unless directly contradicted by other provisions of this Sublease,

Sublessor in the Master Lease (see Paragraph 39.2 of the Master Lease).

     9.4 The signatures of the Master Lessor and any Guarantors of Sublessor at

performed under the Master Lease by Sublessor, Master Lessor agrees to deliver
to Sublessee a copy of any such notice of default. Sublessee shall have the
right to cure any Default of Sublessor described in any notice of default within

offset from and against Sublessor.

default or breach hereof by either Party. The liability (including court costs
and attorneys' fees), of any Broker with respect to negotiation, execution,
delivery or performance by either Sublessor or Sublessee under this Sublease or
any amendment or modification hereto shall be limited to an amount up to the fee
received by such Broker pursuant to this Sublease; provided, however, that the
foregoing limitation on each Broker's liability shall not be applicable to any
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Broker.
