<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;1.&#9;<U>Purpose</U>. The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, (the "Company"), has established this Stock Deferral Plan (the "Plan")(formerly the Stock Retirement Plan) to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by apportioning a part of the total compensation payable to its non-employee directors as deferred income distributed in the form of cash or the Company's common stock, without par value ("Common Stock"), thereby increasing the directors' beneficial ownership of Company stock and their proprietary interest in the Company. The Plan, originally effective as of January 1, 1988, as amended effective as of January 1, 1994, October 25, 1994, and October 24, 1995, is hereby further amended and restated, effective as of January 1, 1997, as set forth herein.</FONT></TD>

In addition to the cash compensation otherwise payable to its non-employee directors as may be determined from time to time, the Company shall establish and maintain a Deferred Stock Account in the name of each non-employee director. Subject to the provisions of Section 9, as soon as practicable following the last day of each fiscal year, the Company shall credit to the Deferred Stock Account of each person who was a non-employee director of the Company on that day or who ceased to be a director after March 31 of that fiscal year by reason of his or her disability or death, a number of Common Stock Units equal in value to the annual retainer amount in effect for non-employee directors as of such date (without regard to other fees or retainers or the actual retainer amount actually received by any such non-employee director) divided by the price of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during such period immediately preceding and/or immediately following such date, as the Company shall determine; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no allocation of Common Stock Units pursuant to this Section 2 shall be made to the Deferred Stock Account of a non-employee director after the later of (i)December 31, 1997 or (ii) the tenth (10th) December following the initial election to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")of such director.</FONT></TD>
