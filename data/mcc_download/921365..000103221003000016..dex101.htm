adequate coverage of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance may be unavailable; and </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">WHEREAS, the
Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Articles and the Oregon Business Corporation Act (the &#147;Act&#148;) expressly
provide that the indemnification provisions set forth in the Act are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Corporation and members of the Board of Directors and officers with respect to indemnification
of directors and officers; and </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the

capacity. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">NOW THEREFORE, the Corporation and Indemnitee agree as follows: </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT

COLOR="#000000">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Indemnity in Third Party Proceedings</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a
party to any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments and fines actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding,
but only if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to
believe that Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any such Proceeding by judgment, order of court, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that
Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was unlawful. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:7%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Pursuant to this Agreement, the Corporation specifically will, and hereby
does, indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Indemnitee against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) to which
Indemnitee may become subject, as a result of serving as a director and/or officer of Merix, under the Securities Act or any other statute or common law, including any amount paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, and to
reimburse them for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating any claims and defending any actions, insofar as any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact regarding Merix, or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Indemnity in
Proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp;By or In the Right of the Corporation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 if Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any
Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, but only if Indemnitee acted in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of any claim, issue or matter
as to which such person shall have been finally adjudged by a court to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of Indemnitee&#146;s duty to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that any court in which such Proceeding was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Indemnification of Expenses of Successful Party</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses
incurred in connection therewith. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Advances of Expenses</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Expenses
incurred by Indemnitee pursuant to Sections 3, 4 and 8 in any Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance at the written request of Indemnitee, if Indemnitee shall undertake to repay such amount to the extent that it is ultimately
determined by a court that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation and shall furnish the Corporation a written affirmation of the Indemnitee&#146;s good faith belief that Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation under this Agreement. Such advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee&#146;s ability to repay such expenses. </FONT></DIV>

day period by (a) the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such proceeding, or (b) independent legal counsel in a written opinion (which counsel shall be appointed if such quorum is not
obtainable), that the Indemnitee has not met the relevant standards for indemnification set forth in Section 3, 4 or 8 or an exclusion set forth in Section 9 is applicable. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV

indemnification or advances are not appropriate shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action
that indemnification or advances are proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) that
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitee&#146;s expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT

Expenses, judgments and fines actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, provided that no indemnity shall be made under this Section 8(a) on account of Indemnitee&#146;s conduct which constitutes a breach of
Indemnitee&#146;s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders or is an act or omission not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or with respect to an unlawful distribution under ORS
