this Agreement.

      8.5   Headings and Interpretation.

      The headings and table of contents used in this Agreement have been

explain, modify, amplify or add to the interpretation, construction or meaning
of any provision of, or scope or intent of, this Agreement nor in any way effect
this Agreement.

      8.6   Bankruptcy.


                                       10
<PAGE>
      All rights and licenses granted to Party (in such capacity and for the
purposes of this Section 8.6 only a "Licensee") pursuant to this Agreement are,
and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the
United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 101, et seq., licenses to rights of
"intellectual property" as defined thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, if the Party granting such license (in such
capacity and for the purposes of this Section only a "Licensor") is under any
proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code, and the trustee in
bankruptcy of Licensor, or Licensor, as a debtor in possession, rightfully
elects to reject this Agreement, Licensee may, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section
365(n)(1) and (2), retain any and all of the rights grated to it hereunder, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, otherwise subject to the terms of this
Agreement. Any purported assumption of this Agreement or of any license granted
hereunder by the trustee in bankruptcy of Licensee, or Licensee, as a debtor in
possession shall be considered a prohibited Assignment of this Agreement or of
any license to Licensee, as the case may be. If Fast is in bankruptcy, or the
equivalent status, under the laws of Norway, and the United States Bankruptcy
Code does not apply to Fast, the Parties wish the same results and consequences
that are set forth herein with respect to the United States Bankruptcy Code to
apply to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Norway.

      8.7   Severability.

      In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in
full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

      8.8   Governing Law.

      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws
provisions thereof.

      8.9   Consent to Jurisdiction.

      Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any California
state court, or federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Los
Angeles County, California, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such California state court or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such Federal court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such California state or
federal court, and (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,


                                       11
<PAGE>
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such California state or federal court. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices herein.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Fast hereby appoints
Howard Novick, as corporate counsel (or his successor), Fast Search & Transfer,
Inc., 93 Worchester Street, Wellesley, MA 02481, tel: (781) 304 2400, fax: (781)
304 2410 as its agent for service of process in connection with any dispute or
action arising hereunder.

      8.10  Assignment and Transfers.

      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither Party may assign or
delegate either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Party, except in
connection with a Change of Control of a Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the case of Fast an Assignment of the Fast Patent License is subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 2.4. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

      8.11  Specific Performance.

      The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

      8.12  Exhibits and Schedules.

      The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement, including the Disclosure
Schedule, form an integral part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated by
reference into this Agreement wherever reference is made to them to the same
extent as if they were set out in full.

      8.13  Other Remedies.

      Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

      8.14  Counterparts.
