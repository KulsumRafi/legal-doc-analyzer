                              REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE

                                  July 29, 2002

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, SANDERSON FARMS, INC., a
Mississippi corporation (the "Company") promises to pay to the order of
_________________________ (the "Lender") on the Revolving Credit Termination
Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) at the principal
office of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, Illinois, the principal sum
of ____________________________________________ or, if less, the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lender to the
Company under the Revolving Credit provided for under the Credit Agreement
hereinafter mentioned and remaining unpaid on the Revolving Credit Termination
Date together with interest on the principal amount of each Revolving Credit
Loan from time to time outstanding hereunder at the rates, and payable in the
manner and on the dates, specified in said Credit Agreement.

         The Lender shall record on its books or records or on the schedule to
this Note which is a part hereof the principal amount of each Revolving Credit
Loan made under the Revolving Credit, all payments of principal and interest and
the principal balances from time to time outstanding; provided that prior to the
transfer of this Note all such amounts shall be recorded on the schedule
attached to this Note. The record thereof, whether shown on such books or
records or on the schedule to this Note, shall be prima facie evidence as to all
such amounts; provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to record, or
any mistake in recording, any of the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Company to repay all Revolving Credit Loans made
under the Revolving Credit, together with accrued interest thereon.

         This Note is one of the Revolving Notes referred to in and issued under
that certain Credit Agreement dated as of July 31, 1996, as amended, among the
Company, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Agent, and the banks named therein,
as amended from time to time (the "Credit Agreement"), and this Note and the
holder hereof are entitled to all of the benefits and security provided for
thereby or referred to therein. Payment of this Note has been guaranteed
pursuant to that certain Guaranty Agreement dated as of July 31, 1996 from the
Guarantor Subsidiaries to the Banks, to which reference is hereby made for a
statement of the terms thereof. All defined terms used in this Note, except
terms otherwise defined herein, shall have the same meaning as such terms have
in said Credit Agreement.

         Prepayments may be made on any Revolving Credit Loan evidenced hereby
and this Note (and the Revolving Credit Loans evidenced hereby) may be declared
due prior to the expressed maturity thereof, all in the events, on the terms and
in the manner as provided for in said Credit Agreement.

         This Note is issued in substitution and replacement of, and in part
evidences indebtedness formerly evidenced by, the Revolving Credit Note dated
[July 29, 1999, for Trustmark and April 6, 2001 for AmSouth], of the Company
payable to the order of the Lender issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

         The Company hereby waives presentment for payment and demand.

         This Note is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Illinois.

                                 SANDERSON FARMS, INC.
