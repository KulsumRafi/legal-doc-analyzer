                    AGREEMENT ASSIGNING AND TERMINATING LEASE
                        AGREEMENTS AND RELEASING PARTIES

          THIS AGREEMENT is made this 16th day of January 2003, by and among
LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Pennsylvania limited partnership
("Landlord"), VERTICALNET, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("VerticalNet") and
ATLAS COMMERCE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Atlas").

                                   BACKGROUND:

     A.   Landlord and VerticalNet entered into a Lease Agreement dated April

covering premises containing approximately 84,563 rentable square feet at 700
Dresher Road, Horsham, Pennsylvania, as more fully described in the 700 Dresher
Lease (the "700 Dresher Premises").

     B.   Landlord and Atlas (then known as Aatlas Commerce, Inc.) entered into
a Lease Agreement dated January 12, 2000 (the "300 Chesterfield Lease"),
covering premises containing approximately 27,260 rentable square feet at 300

     C.   Landlord and Atlas (then known as Aatlas Commerce, Inc.) entered into
a Lease Agreement dated January 12, 2000 (the "400 Chesterfield Lease
Agreement"), as amended by First Amendment to Lease Agreement dated April 13,
2000 (the 400 Chesterfield Lease Agreement, as amended, collectively, the "400
Chesterfield Lease"), covering premises containing approximately 4,772 rentable
square feet at 400 Chesterfield Parkway, Malvern, Pennsylvania, as more fully
described in the 400 Chesterfield Lease (the "400 Chesterfield Premises").

     D.   VerticalNet acquired Atlas on December 30, 2001 and Atlas is now a
subsidiary of VerticalNet.

     E.   Atlas desires to assign all of its right, title and interest in the
300 Chesterfield Lease and the 400 Chesterfield Lease to VerticalNet and
VerticalNet desires to accept such assignment and Landlord has agreed thereto.

     F.   VerticalNet and Landlord have agreed to an early termination of the
700 Dresher Lease, the 300 Chesterfield Lease and the 400 Chesterfield Lease
(collectively, the "Leases") prior to their respective Expiration Dates (as
defined in the Leases) in accordance with the terms and conditions contained
herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual
promises and covenants contained herein and in the Leases, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

<PAGE>

     1.   Atlas hereby sells, assigns and transfers to VerticalNet all of its
right, title and interest, as tenant, in and to the 300 Chesterfield Lease and
the 400 Chesterfield Lease, including without limitation, all of its right,
title and interest in and to the Security Deposits thereunder. VerticalNet
hereby assumes all of the obligations of Atlas under the 300 Chesterfield Lease
and the 400 Chesterfield Lease and agrees to be bound by all of the provisions
thereof as if it were the original Tenant under the 300 Chesterfield Lease and
the 400 Chesterfield Lease.

     2.   Landlord hereby consents to the assignment of the 300 Chesterfield
Lease and the 400 Chesterfield Lease by Atlas to VerticalNet, provided, however,
that Atlas is not released from liability thereunder, subject to the terms of
this Agreement.

     3.   Within five (5) business days after the date this Agreement is fully
executed, VerticalNet shall pay to Landlord, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the sum of $1,575,970.93, constituting an agreed early
termination fee under the 700 Dresher Lease.

     4.   Within five (5) business days after the date this Agreement is fully
executed, VerticalNet shall pay to Landlord, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the sum of $699,628.44, constituting an agreed early
termination fee under the 300 Chesterfield and 400 Chesterfield Leases in the
amount of $763,820.45, less (a) the amount of the Security Deposit under the 300
Chesterfield Lease in the amount of $53,952.09, and (b) the amount of the
Security Deposit under the 400 Chesterfield Lease in the amount of $10,239.92.
Landlord shall retain for its own account the Security Deposits under the 300
Chesterfield and 400 Chesterfield Leases and VerticalNet agrees that it
disclaims and has no further right, title or interest therein.

     5.   Landlord and VerticalNet acknowledge and agree that Landlord presently
holds, as escrow agent for VerticalNet, certain Certificates of Deposit (the
"Certificates of Deposit") at Comerica Bank (the "Bank") listed on Exhibit "A"
attached hereto, which constitute the Security Deposit and the Additional
Security Deposit (as defined in the 700 Dresher Lease). Upon Landlord's receipt
of the sums to be paid by VerticalNet pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this
Agreement, Landlord agrees that it disclaims and has no further right, title or
interest in and to the Certificates of Deposit and the proceeds thereof and that
the Certificates of Deposit and the proceeds thereof shall be retained by
VerticalNet for its own account. Within one (1) business day after Landlord's
receipt of the sums to be paid by VerticalNet pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of
this Agreement, Landlord shall send to the Bank by facsimile and by nationally
recognized overnight courier a letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "B"
authorizing and directing the Bank to change the name of the account holder of
the Certificates of Deposit from Landlord, as Agent (or Escrow Agent) for
VerticalNet, to the sole account of VerticalNet.

     6.   The 700 Dresher Lease shall terminate on January 31, 2003 (the "700
Dresher Termination Date"). On or before the 700 Dresher Termination Date,
VerticalNet shall surrender the 700 Dresher Premises to Landlord leaving same in
the condition it is required to be surrendered under the 700 Dresher Lease.
Prior to the 700 Dresher Termination Date, Landlord and VerticalNet shall
jointly inspect the 700 Dresher Premises and any deficiencies in such condition
shall be repaired at VerticalNet's expense, such obligation to survive the 700
Dresher Termination Date.

VerticalNet shall have any rights or obligations under the 700 Dresher Lease

such furniture and equipment free and clear of any liens, encumbrances,

mortgages, pledges, capital leases or other security interests. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, VerticalNet may, at its option, retain sufficient furniture,
including desks, cubicles and file cabinets to furnish the 400 Chesterfield
