<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">MagStar Technologies, Inc.

(formerly Reuter Manufacturing, Inc.) announced that on February 25, 2003, it

sold and leased back its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Hopkins,

Minnesota.&#160; The purchaser was Hopkins

Eleventh Avenue LLC (&#147;Eleventh Avenue&#148;), an affiliate of the Company&#146;s largest

shareholder.</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The purchase price for

the building and property was $3,700,000, consisting of $3,189,148.03 in cash

and a Promissory Note for $510,851.97.&#160;&#160;

The Company entered into a 6.5 year gross lease with Eleventh Avenue for

the building and property at an annual cost of $3.50 per square foot,

aggregating $382,935.00 per year for the first three years and escalating to

$417,948.00 per year for the remaining three and one half years.</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the transaction, the

Company paid in full its mortgage on the property with U.S. Bank in the amount

of $2,675,798.08, including accrued interest.&#160;

The mortgage had originally been entered into as security for Term Loan

A under the provisions of the Company&#146;s Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank dated

October 20, 2000.</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">As of January 31, 2003,

the land and building had a balance sheet value of $1,551,081.74, including

depreciation.&#160; The sale price of

$3,700,000 resulted in a balance sheet gain of&#160;

$2,148,918.26 which will be realized over the life of the lease from

Eleventh Avenue.&#160; After paying off the

mortgage, the Company used the net cash and Promissory Note proceeds totaling

$1,024,201.92 to reduce debt owed to Activar Properties, Inc. and affiliates.</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Eleventh Avenue is a

wholly owned subsidiary of Activar Properties, Inc. which in turn is wholly

owned by Richard F. McNamara, a director of the Company.&#160; James L. Reissner, the President of Activar

Properties, Inc., is also a director and shareholder of the Company.&#160; Richard F. McNamara is also the owner of

Activar, Inc., the largest shareholder of the Company.</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>



<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Board of Directors

of the Company authorized the transaction in order to reduce the indebtedness

of the Company and improve cash flow.&#160;

In the course of the past two years, Activar Properties, Inc. and

affiliates have supplied much of the Company&#146;s cash needs, and the Company&#146;s

outstanding balance to Activar Properties, Inc. and affiliates was

approximately $5,513,000 as of February 28, 2003.&#160; The transaction with Eleventh Avenue was determined to be on

better terms than could be obtained by the Company directly from unaffiliated

financing sources.&#160; The purchase price

was based upon an independent appraisal of the value of the property and

building obtained by the bank which provided financing to Eleventh Avenue in

connection with the transaction.</font></p>
