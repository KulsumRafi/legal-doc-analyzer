--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              CONCORD CAMERA CORP.
                  FLEXIBLE PERQUISITE SPENDING ACCOUNT PROGRAM
                               FOR KEY EXECUTIVES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.       Purpose

The Flexible Perquisite Spending Account Program for Key Executives (the
"Program") of Concord Camera Corp. (the "Company") has been designed to offer
executive benefits that consider executives' personal needs by providing
"choice" in selecting perquisites. The Program enables Key Executives (as
defined herein) to avail themselves of those perquisites most suitable to
his/her individual needs utilizing a Flexible Perquisite Spending Account (the
"Account").

2.       Effective Date

The Program is first effective for fiscal year 2002 (July 1, 2001 through June
29, 2002 inclusive) and shall continue thereafter for each consecutive fiscal
year until terminated.

3.       Participation

Ira B. Lampert, the Chief Executive Officer, Keith L. Lampert, the Executive
Vice President and Director of Worldwide Operations, and Brian F. King, the
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, shall automatically
participate in the Program irrespective of any subsequent changes to their
titles and/or changes in the office(s) they hold with the Company, but only for
so long as they continue to meet the requirements set forth in subparagraph 1 of
this Section 3. Within 180 days after the commencement of each fiscal year, the
Chief Executive Officer shall designate the additional Key Executives who may
participate in the Program for such fiscal year.

In addition to the executive officers described in the immediately preceding
paragraph, "Key Executive" shall mean those officers who have been:

         1.   designated by the Company's Board of Directors as an "executive
              officer" of the Company and as an "officer" for purposes of
              Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and

         2.   determined by the Chief Executive Officer to be a key executive of
              the Company.

4.       Flexible Qualifying Perquisite Spending Account

An Account of $10,000 will be established on behalf of each participating
executive for each fiscal year. The participating executive may use the Account
for certain perquisites described in Section 5 and Appendix A ("Qualifying
Perquisites"). The Account operates on a fiscal year cash basis, and any unused
amounts in the account at the end of the fiscal year will be forfeited. Unused
amounts are not available in cash nor are they available for carry-over to the
next fiscal year (i.e., the Account operates on a "use it or lose it" basis).
However, any expenses incurred during the fiscal year for Qualifying Perquisites
and not fully reimbursed by the end of the fiscal year will be promptly
reimbursed in the next fiscal year and debited against the Account for the prior
fiscal year. If, in the event, Qualifying Perquisite expenses are not fully
reimbursed by the end of the fiscal year and these expenses exceed the $10,000
limit, no more than $10,000 of the amount exceeding the $10,000 limit will be
reimbursed in the next fiscal year and debited against the participating
executive's Account for the next fiscal year; provided, however, that the
participating executive must continue to be a Key Executive at the time such
reimbursement is to be made. Qualifying Perquisite expenses exceeding the
$10,000 per fiscal year limit may not, under any circumstances, be carried over
beyond the fiscal year immediately following the one in which they were
incurred.

5.       Qualifying Perquisites

Appendix A contains a list of Qualifying Perquisites for which each
participating executive will receive reimbursement from their Account. A brief
description of the Qualifying Perquisites and their anticipated tax treatment
are also included. As a general matter, reimbursements for Qualifying
Perquisites will be treated as income to the participating executive unless
otherwise noted, and the Company will not reimburse the participating executive
for the taxes associated with such imputed income. If, however, the Qualifying
Perquisite is either fully or partially related to the participating executive's
performance of business for the Company, the portion of the cost of the
Qualifying Perquisite related to such business use generally will not be imputed
as taxable income to the executive, as summarized in Appendix A. In order to
exclude such amounts from income, however, the executive must submit additional
documentation with respect to such items as detailed in Appendix A.

APPENDIX A GENERALLY DESCRIBES THE PRINCIPAL FEDERAL (BUT NOT STATE OR LOCAL)
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECEIPT OF PERQUISITES UNDER THE PROGRAM.
HOWEVER, THIS SUMMARY IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND NOT INTENDED TO COVER ALL TAX
CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY APPLY TO A PARTICULAR EXECUTIVE. EACH PARTICIPATING
EXECUTIVE SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER OWN TAX PROFESSIONAL TO ASCERTAIN THEIR
SPECIFIC TAX SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO BENEFITS RECEIVED UNDER THE PROGRAM.

6.       Submission of Qualifying Perquisite Expenses for Reimbursement

In order to receive reimbursement from his or her Account for a Qualifying
Perquisite, the participating executive must submit the documents and
information specified in Appendix A, as appropriate, to his or her immediate
direct report for approval within 90 days of incurring the Qualifying Perquisite
expense. Reimbursement claims for all Qualifying Perquisite expenses incurred
during the fiscal year must be submitted within 90 days of the end of such
fiscal year in order to be eligible for reimbursement under the Program.

7.       Reimbursement Payments

Reimbursements will not be made to the executive for any amount exceeding
$10,000 in any fiscal year. Within two (2) weeks after the executive submits an
expense report for a Qualifying Perquisite expense(s) which has been approved by
his or her direct report, the Company will make payment to and reimburse the
executive, at which time the executive's Account will be debited for such
amount, provided, however, that to the extent that the total of an executive's
Qualifying Perquisite expenses for a fiscal year exceeds $10,000, payment and/or
reimbursement for the carried-over expense amount shall be made within two (2)
weeks of the commencement of the next fiscal year and debited to the executive's
Account for the next fiscal year; provided, however, that the participating
executive must continue to be a Key Executive at the time such reimbursement is
to be made.

8.       Termination of Employment

If a participating executive's employment is terminated for any reason (or for
no reason), the Company will make payment to or reimburse the executive (or the
executive's legal representative or estate, as appropriate) for only those
Qualifying Perquisite expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the
executive's termination of employment. Within sixty (60) days of the executive's
termination of employment with the Company, the executive will submit to the
Company an expense report for any unpaid Qualifying Perquisite expenses, subject
to the requirements of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 above.

9.       Miscellaneous

The Program does not create or give any contractual rights to any employee, nor
is it evidence of any contract or covenant of employment. The Company reserves
the right to modify, revoke, suspend or change the Program at any time and from
time to time, in its sole discretion. This information is the property of the
Company and should not be reproduced, distributed or disclosed to persons or
entities outside the Company without the prior express written permission of the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
