Note, which Capitalized Interest Note shall have the following terms:

(1) secured by the collateral described or referred to in the Loan Documents, as
defined in the Master Amendment, and (2) the breach or occurrence of a default
under the Loan Documents, at the option of the Bank, will constitute a default
under the Renewal Revolving Promissory Note.

            (d.) The Capitalized Interest Note (and any and all extensions,
modifications, renewals or amendments thereof) shall be (1) secured by the
collateral described or referred to in the Loan Documents, as defined in the
Master Amendment, and (2) the breach or occurrence of a default under the Loan
Documents, at the option of the Bank, will constitute a default under the
Capitalized Interest Note.

         2. In regard to Letter of Credit numbered 1813094 in favor of
Continental Health Properties of Thomasville, LLC in the amount of $200,000.00
(the "Letter of Credit") the parties agree that, absent a default under this
Agreement or the Loan Documents, the Letter of Credit shall continue in
accordance with its terms, unless earlier terminated pursuant to an agreement of

payments, the first monthly payment being due thirty (30) days after the draw,
in the amount of $33,333.00 plus interest compounded from the date of draw until

following additional restrictions:

                (i) The maximum amount which may be outstanding at any time
under the Working Capital Line shall be further reduced by the outstanding
amount of Letter of Credit No. 1813094, which shall continue as an outstanding
Letter of Credit after the execution hereof as set forth herein above.

                (ii) Because the maximum amount which may be outstanding at any
time under the Working Capital Line has been reduced, the provision set forth in

deleted.

to time as such, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) (fifty basis points) per
annum, provided that the interest rate shall in no event exceed nine and one
half percent (9.5%) per annum until after default or maturity, at which time the
default rate of interest set forth in the instruments and documents evidencing

All principal and unpaid interest shall be payable at maturity on July 11, 2003.
The Modified Revolving Promissory Note (and any and all extensions,
modifications, renewals or amendments thereof) shall continue to be (1) secured
by the collateral described or referred to in the Loan Documents, as defined in

Loan Documents, at the option of the Bank, will constitute a default under the
Renewal Revolving Promissory Note.

            (c) Debtors acknowledge that they are presently in default of the
amended financial covenants appearing in Section 2 (c) of the Master Amendment.
Debtors also acknowledge that they are presently in default of Section 5.1
(c)(iii) of the Master Credit Security Agreement executed by the parties as of
December 27, 1996. Provided that there exists no other default under this
Agreement or the Loan Documents, as amended, AmSouth expressly agrees to forbear
from exercising its remedies under default of these amended financial covenants
but only until July 11, 2003.

         4. In regard to the current NC Bridge Loan Note, which was amended
pursuant to First Amendment to Renewal Promissory Note executed by DALS-NC in
December, 2000, the parties will execute a Second Amendment to Renewal
Promissory Note which shall modify the interest rate applicable prior to default
