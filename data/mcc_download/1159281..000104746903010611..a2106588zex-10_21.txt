              (d) The chief executive office and the principal place of business
of the Tenant are as set forth in Schedule 1 and the Tenant will not move its
chief executive office or establish any other principal place of business except
to such new location as the Tenant may establish in accordance with this Section
3(d). The location of each Facility comprising a portion of the Leased Property
is as set forth in Schedule 2. The originals of all documents evidencing
Collateral and the only original books of account and records of the Tenant
relating thereto are, and will continue to be, kept at such chief executive
office or the applicable Facility, as the case may be, or at such new location
as the Tenant may establish in accordance with this Section 3(d). The Tenant
shall not move its chief executive office or establish any other principal place
of business until (i) the Tenant shall have given to the Secured Party not less
than ten (10) days' prior written notice of its intention to do so, which notice
shall clearly describe such new location and provide such other information in
connection therewith as the Secured Party may reasonably request, and (ii) with
respect to such new location, the Tenant shall have taken such action,
satisfactory to the Secured Party (including, without limitation, all action
required by Section 5), to maintain the security interest of the Secured Party
in the Collateral.

              (e) All tangible personal property owned on the date hereof by the
Tenant to be used in connection with the operation or maintenance of the Leased
Property, or any portion thereof, is located at each applicable Property or is
in transit to such Property from the vendor thereof. The Tenant agrees that (i)
all such property held by the Tenant on the date hereof, once at each applicable
Property, shall remain at such Property and (ii) all such property subsequently
acquired by the Tenant shall immediately upon acquisition be transferred to and
remain at the applicable Property.

              (f) The Tenant's corporate name and organizational identification
number are as set forth on the signature page hereto. The name under which each
of the Facilities is operated is set forth on Schedule 2. The Tenant shall not
(i) change such name without providing the Secured Party with thirty (30) days'
prior written notice and making all filings and taking all such other actions as
the Secured Party determines are necessary or appropriate to continue or perfect
the security interest granted hereunder, (ii) change its corporate
organizational number, nor (iii) conduct its business in any other name or take
title to any Collateral in any other name while this Agreement remains in
effect. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 1,

the Tenant has not ever had any other name nor conducted business in any other
name in any jurisdiction. The Tenant is organized as a Maryland real estate
investment trust. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease, the Tenant
shall not change its organizational structure or jurisdiction of organization
without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof to the
Secured Party.

              (g) The Secured Party is authorized (but is under no obligation)
to make, upon ten (10) Business Days' notice to the Tenant (except in the case
of exigent circumstances, in which circumstances upon such notice, if any, as
may then be reasonably practical), any payments which in the Secured Party's
opinion are necessary to:

              (i)    discharge any liens which have or may take priority over
                     the lien hereof; and

              (ii)   pay all premiums payable on the insurance policies referred
                     to in the Lease or any other document or agreement executed
                     in connection therewith or herewith, upon the failure of
                     the Tenant to make such payments within the time permitted
                     therein.


The Tenant shall have no claim against the Secured Party by reason of its
decision not to make any payments or perform such obligations permitted under
this Section 3(g). The Tenant shall repay to the Secured Party any sums paid by
the Secured Party upon demand. Any sums paid and expenses incurred by the
Secured Party pursuant to this paragraph shall bear interest at the Overdue
Rate.

              (h) If any of the Collateral at any time becomes evidenced by an
Instrument, the Tenant shall promptly deliver such Instrument to the Secured
Party, appropriately endorsed to the order of the Secured Party, to be held
pursuant to this Agreement.

              (i) The Tenant shall not sell, transfer, change the registration,
if any, of, dispose of, attempt to dispose of, or substantially modify or
abandon the Collateral or any material part thereof, other than as permitted
under the Lease, without the prior written consent of the Secured Party. Except
as permitted under the Lease, the Tenant shall not create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any lien upon any of the Collateral without the prior written
consent of the Secured Party.

part thereof.

              (k) The Tenant shall, upon demand, pay to the Secured Party the
amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, which the Secured Party
may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Agreement, (ii) the
custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of
any of the rights of the Secured Party hereunder and under such other agreements
or (iv) the failure by the Tenant to perform or observe any of the provisions
hereof.

              (l) The Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless the Secured Party
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Secured Party in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or arising out of the Tenant's obligations under any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
of any such other documents.

         Section 4. Special Provisions Concerning Equipment. The Tenant shall
not impair the rights of the Secured Party in the Equipment. Regardless of the
manner of the affixation of any Equipment to real property, the Equipment so
attached shall at all times constitute and remain personal property. The Tenant
retains all liability and responsibility in connection with the Equipment and
the liability of the Tenant to pay the Obligations shall in no way be affected
or diminished by reason of the fact that such Equipment may be lost, destroyed,
stolen or damaged or for any reason whatsoever have become unavailable to the
Tenant. Upon the request of the Secured Party, the Tenant shall provide to the
Secured Party a current list of Equipment.

         Section 5.  Financing Statements; Documentary Stamp Taxes.

attorney, certificates, reports and other assurances or instruments and take
such further steps relating to the Collateral and other property or rights
covered by the security interest hereby granted, which the Secured Party
reasonably deems appropriate or advisable to perfect, preserve or protect its
security interest in the Collateral. The Tenant authorizes the Secured Party to
file any such financing statements without the signature of the Tenant and the
Tenant will pay all applicable filing fees and related expenses. To the extent
permitted by law, a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement
or a financing statement shall be sufficient as a financing statement.

              (b) The Tenant shall procure, pay for, affix to any and all
documents and cancel any documentary tax stamps required by and in accordance
with, applicable law, and the Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless the

in respect of such documentary stamp taxes.

                     at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for
                     future delivery, and at such price or prices and on such
                     terms as the Secured Party may determine, with the amounts
                     realized from any such sale to be applied to the Secured
                     Obligations in the manner determined by the Secured Party.


The Tenant hereby agrees that all of the foregoing may be effected without
demand, advertisement or notice (except as hereinafter provided or as may be
required by law), all of which (except as hereinafter provided) are hereby
expressly waived, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Secured Party
shall not be obligated to do any of the acts hereinabove authorized and in the
event that the Secured Party elects to do any such act, the Secured Party shall
not be responsible to the Tenant.

              (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Secured Party may take legal proceedings for the appointment of a
receiver or receivers (to which the Secured Party shall be entitled as a matter
of right) to take possession of the Collateral pending the sale thereof pursuant
either to the powers of sale granted by this Agreement



                                      -11-

or to a judgment, order or decree made in any judicial proceeding for the
foreclosure or involving the enforcement of this Agreement. If, after the
exercise of any or all of such rights and remedies, any of the Obligations shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied, the Tenant shall remain liable for any deficiency
or performance thereof, as applicable.

              (c) Upon any sale of any of the Collateral, whether made under the
power of sale hereby given or under judgment, order or decree in any judicial
proceeding for the foreclosure or involving the enforcement of this Agreement:

              (i)    the Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property
                     being sold and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may
                     hold, retain and possess and dispose of such property in
                     its own absolute right without further accountability, and
                     may, in paying the purchase money therefor, deliver any
                     instruments evidencing the Obligations or agree to the
                     satisfaction of all or a portion of the Obligations in lieu
                     of cash in payment of the amount which shall be payable
                     thereon, and such instruments, in case the amounts so
                     payable thereon shall be less than the amount due thereon,
                     shall be returned to the Secured Party after being
                     appropriately stamped to show partial payment;

              (ii)   the Secured Party may make and deliver to the purchaser or
                     purchasers a good and sufficient deed, bill of sale and
                     instrument of assignment and transfer of the property sold;

              (iii)  all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever,
                     either at law or in equity or otherwise, of the Tenant of,
                     in and to the property so sold shall be divested; such sale
                     shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against
                     the Tenant, its successors and assigns, and against any and
                     all Persons claiming or who may claim the property sold or
                     any part thereof from, through or under the Tenant, its
                     successors or assigns;

              (iv)   the receipt of the Secured Party or of the officers thereof
                     making such sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the
                     purchaser or purchasers at such sale for his or their
                     purchase money, and such purchaser or



                                      -12-

<PAGE>


                     purchasers, and his or their assigns or personal
                     representatives, shall not, after paying such purchase
                     money and receiving such receipt of the Secured Party or of
                     such officer therefor, be obliged to see to the application
                     of such purchase money or be in any way answerable for any
                     loss, misapplication or nonapplication thereof; and

              (v)    to the extent that it may lawfully do so, the Tenant agrees
                     that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in
                     any manner whatsoever claim or take advantage of, any
                     appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption
                     laws, or any law permitting it to direct the order in which
                     the Collateral or any part thereof shall be sold, now or at
                     any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or
                     otherwise affect the performance or enforcement of this
                     Agreement or any other document, the Lease or any other
                     document or agreement entered into in connection herewith
                     or therewith, and the Tenant hereby expressly waives all
                     benefit or advantage of any such laws and covenants that it
                     will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power
                     granted or delegated to the Secured Party in this
                     Agreement, but will suffer and permit the execution of
                     every such power as though no such laws were in force.

In the event of any sale of Collateral pursuant to this Section 7, the Secured
Party shall, at least ten (10) days before such sale, give the Tenant written
notice of its intention to sell, except that, if the Secured Party shall
determine in its reasonable discretion that any of the Collateral threatens to
decline in value, any such sale may be made upon three (3) days' written notice
to the Tenant, which time periods the Tenant hereby agrees are reasonable.

              (d) The Secured Party is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of the Tenant in its name and stead, to make all
necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of assignment and transfer of the
property sold pursuant to this Section 7 and for such other purposes as are
necessary or desirable to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement, and for
that purpose it may execute and deliver all necessary deeds, bills of sale and
instruments of assignment and transfer, and may substitute one or more Persons
with like



                                      -13-

<PAGE>


              power, the Tenant hereby ratifying and confirming all that its
said attorney, or such substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by virtue
hereof. If so requested by the Secured Party or by any purchaser, the Tenant
shall ratify and confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering
to the Secured Party or to such purchaser all property, deeds, bills of sale,
instruments or assignment and transfer and releases as may be designated in any
such request.

         Section 8. Application of Moneys. All moneys which the Secured Party
shall receive pursuant hereto shall first be applied (to the extent thereof) to
the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
administration and enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights under, this
Agreement or any of without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
its counsel and agents), and the balance, if any, shall be applied first to
accrued and unpaid interest, charges and fees on, and then to outstanding
principal of, any Obligations of the Tenant (or its affiliates) to the Secured
Party, and then to any other amounts outstanding on any such Obligations and
then as required by law to any other parties having an interest therein.

         Section 9. Waivers, Etc. The Tenant, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its successors and assigns, hereby waives presentment, demand, notice, protest
and, except as is otherwise specifically provided herein, all other demands and
notices in connection with this Agreement or the enforcement of the rights of
the Secured Party hereunder or in connection with any Obligations or any
Collateral; waives all rights to require a marshaling of assets by the Secured
Party; consents to and waives notice of (i) the substitution, release or
surrender of any Collateral, (ii) the addition or release of Persons primarily
or secondarily liable on any Obligation or on any Collateral, (iii) the
acceptance of partial payments on any Collateral and/or the settlement or
compromise thereof, (iv) any requirement of diligence or promptness on the part
of the Secured Party in the enforcement of any rights in respect of any
Collateral or any other agreement or instrument directly or indirectly relating
thereto, and (v) any enforcement of any present or future agreement or
instrument relating directly or indirectly to the Collateral. No delay or
omission on the part of the Secured Party or any holder of Obligations in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any
other right hereunder. No waiver of any such right on any one occasion shall be
construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right on any future occasion. No
course of dealing between the Tenant and the Secured Party or any holder of
Obligations,



                                      -14-

<PAGE>


         nor any failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part
of the Secured Party or any holder of Obligations, any right, power or privilege
hereunder or under any of the Obligations, shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

         The Tenant further waives any right it may have under the constitution
of any state or commonwealth in which any of the Collateral may be located, or
under the Constitution of the United States of America, to notice (except for
notice specifically required hereby) or to a judicial hearing prior to the
exercise of any right or remedy provided by this Agreement to the Secured Party,
and waives its rights, if any, to set aside or invalidate any sale duly
consummated in accordance with the foregoing provisions hereof on the grounds
(if such be the case) that the sale was consummated without a prior judicial
hearing. THE TENANT'S WAIVERS UNDER THIS SECTION 9 HAVE BEEN MADE VOLUNTARILY,
INTELLIGENTLY AND KNOWINGLY AND AFTER THE TENANT HAS BEEN APPRISED AND COUNSELED
BY ITS ATTORNEYS AS TO THE NATURE THEREOF AND ITS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE RIGHTS.

         The Secured Party shall not be required to marshal any present or
future security for (including without limitation this Agreement and the
Collateral pledged hereunder), or guaranties of, the Obligations or any of them,
or to resort to such security or guaranties in any particular order; and all of
the rights hereunder and in respect of such securities and guaranties shall be
cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising. To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Tenant hereby agrees that it
will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which, might
cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the Secured Party's rights under
this Agreement or under any other instrument evidencing any of the Obligations
or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the
Obligations is secured or guaranteed, and, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, the Tenant hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such
laws.

         Section 10. Further Assurances as to Collateral; Attorney-in-Fact. From
time to time hereafter, the Tenant will execute and deliver, or will cause to be
executed and delivered, such additional instruments, certificates or documents
(including, without limitation, financing statements, renewal statements,
mortgages, collateral assignments and other security documents), and will take
all such actions as the Secured Party may



                                      -15-

<PAGE>

reasonably request, for the purposes of implementing or effectuating the
provisions of this Agreement or of more fully perfecting or renewing the Secured
Party's rights with respect to the Collateral (or with respect to any additions
thereto or replacements or proceeds thereof or with respect to any other
property or assets hereafter acquired by the Tenant which may be deemed to be a
part of the Collateral) pursuant hereto and thereto. The Secured Party is hereby
appointed the attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, of the Tenant
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any
action, including, without limitation, executing, delivering and filing
applications, certificates, instruments and other documents and papers with
governmental authorities, and executing any instruments, including without
limitation financing or continuation statements, deeds to secure debt,
mortgages, assignments, conveyances, assignments and transfers which are
required to be taken or executed by the Tenant under this Agreement, on its
behalf and in its name which appointment is coupled with an interest, is
irrevocable and durable and shall survive the subsequent dissolution, disability
or incapacity of the Tenant.

         Section 11. Arbitration. The Secured Party or the Tenant may elect to
submit any dispute hereunder that has an amount in controversy in excess of
$250,000 to arbitration hereunder. Any such dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Association
then pertaining and the decision of the arbitrators with respect to such dispute
shall be binding, final and conclusive on the parties.

         In the event the Secured Party or the Tenant shall elect to submit any
such dispute to arbitration hereunder, the Secured Party and the Tenant shall
each appoint and pay all fees of a fit and impartial person as arbitrator with
at least ten (10) years' recent professional experience in the general subject
matter of the dispute. Notice of such appointment shall be sent in writing by
each party to the other, and the arbitrators so appointed, in the event of their
failure to agree within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second
arbitrator upon the matter so submitted, shall appoint a third arbitrator. If
either the Secured Party or the Tenant shall fail to appoint an arbitrator, as
aforesaid, for a period of twenty (20) days after written notice from the other
party to make such appointment, then the arbitrator appointed by the party
having made such appointment shall appoint a second arbitrator and the two (2)
so appointed shall, in the event of their failure to agree upon any decision
within thirty (30) days thereafter, appoint a third arbitrator. If such
arbitrators fail to agree upon a third



                                      -16-

<PAGE>


arbitrator within forty five (45) days after the appointment of the second
arbitrator, then such third arbitrator shall be appointed by the American
Arbitration Association from its qualified panel of arbitrators, and shall be a
person having at least ten (10) years' recent professional experience as to the
subject matter in question. The fees of the third arbitrator and the expenses
incident to the proceedings shall be borne equally between the Secured Party and
the Tenant, unless the arbitrators decide otherwise. The fees of respective
counsel engaged by the parties, and the fees of expert witnesses and other
witnesses called for the parties, shall be paid by the respective party engaging
such counsel or calling or engaging such witnesses.

         The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered within thirty (30)
days after appointment of the third arbitrator. Such decision shall be in
writing and in duplicate, one counterpart thereof to be delivered to the Secured
Party and one to the Tenant. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may
be entered upon the award of the arbitrators in accordance with the rules and
statutes applicable thereto then obtaining.

         Section 12.  Miscellaneous.

              (a) The Tenant agrees that its obligations and the rights of the
Secured Party hereunder and in respect of the Obligations may be enforced by
specific performance hereof and thereof and by temporary, preliminary and/or
final injunctive relief relating hereto and thereto, without necessity for proof
by the Secured Party or any holder of the Obligations that it would otherwise
suffer irreparable harm, and the Tenant hereby consents to the issuance of such
specific and injunctive relief.

              (b) Any notice or demand upon the Tenant or the Secured Party
shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given when given in accordance with
the provisions of the Lease.

              (c) None of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be
changed, waived, modified or varied in any manner whatsoever unless in writing
duly signed by the Tenant and the Secured Party. No notice to or demand on the
Tenant in any case shall entitle the Tenant to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the
rights of the Secured Party to any other or further action in any circumstances
without notice or demand.

              (d) The obligations of the Tenant hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect without regard to, and shall not be impaired by, (i) any

<PAGE>


arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of the Tenant;
(ii) any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of, any right, remedy, power or
privilege under or in respect of this Agreement, the Lease or any document or
agreement executed in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligations or any
security for any of the Obligations; or (iii) any amendment to or modification
of any of the Lease or any document or agreement executed in connection herewith
or therewith, the Obligations or any security for any of the Obligations;
whether or not the Tenant shall have notice or knowledge of any of the
foregoing. The rights and remedies of the Secured Party herein provided for are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Party
would otherwise have, including, without limitation, under the Lease or any
document or agreement executed in connection herewith or therewith. This
Agreement is intended as a supplement for and is not intended to supersede in
any respect the Lease or any document or agreement executed in connection
herewith or therewith.

              (e) This Agreement shall be binding upon the Tenant and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Secured Party, and
its respective successors and assigns. All agreements, representations and
warranties made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

              (f) The descriptive headings of the several sections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

              (g) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibitions or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

              (h) This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, applied and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
applicable to contracts between residents of Massachusetts which are to be
performed entirely within Massachusetts, regardless of (i) where this Agreement

required by this Agreement is made or required to be made; or (iii) where any
breach of any provision of this Agreement occurs, or any cause of action
otherwise accrues; or (iv) where any action or other proceeding is instituted or
pending; or (v) the nationality, citizenship, domicile,

principle place of business, or jurisdiction of organization or domestication of
any party; or (vi) whether the laws of the forum jurisdiction otherwise would
apply the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
or (vii) any combination of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that matters of title, or creation, perfection and priority of the
security interests created hereby, or procedural issues of foreclosures are
required to be governed by the laws of the state in which the Collateral, or
relevant part thereof, is located, the laws of such State shall apply.

         Section 13. Nonliability of Trustees. THE DECLARATION OF TRUST
ESTABLISHING THE SECURED PARTY, A COPY OF WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ALL AMENDMENTS
THERETO (THE "DECLARATION"), IS DULY FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS
