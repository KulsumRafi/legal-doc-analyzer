                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

          THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of April 3,
2001, is by and among UMB Financial Corp., a Missouri corporation (the "Buyer"),
and the persons listed on Exhibit A attached hereto (individually, a "Seller"
and collectively, the "Sellers").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

          A. The Sellers have represented to Buyer that they are the record and
beneficial owners of 50,000 shares (the "Shares") of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Sunstone Financial Group, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the
"Company"), with its principal office at 803 W. Michigan Street, Suite A,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and that the Shares constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company.

          B. The Buyer desires to acquire from the Sellers, and the Sellers
desire to sell to Buyer, all of the Shares.

          C. The Buyer and the Sellers have entered into a letter of intent
dated January 24, 2001 (the "Letter of Intent"), regarding the purchase of the
Shares by the Buyer.

                                    AGREEMENT

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above and
the respective representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions
contained herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                          PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES
                          ---------------------------

          Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares. At the Closing (as defined in
Section 2.1 hereof), each Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and
deliver good, valid, marketable and indefeasible title in and to the number of
Shares set forth on Exhibit A hereto opposite such Seller's name to the Buyer,
and the Buyer shall purchase the Shares from Sellers, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

          Section 1.2 Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale and transfer
of the Shares, Buyer agrees as follows:

          (a) Treatment of Option Holders. The Company has outstanding to each
     of the persons listed on Exhibit B attached hereto (each, an "Option
     Holder"), parallel stock unit rights (the "Option Rights"). The parties
     agree that immediately prior to the Closing

                                       -1-

<PAGE>

     Date, the Company shall settle the Option Rights for (i) cash in the
     amounts set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto, and in accordance with the
     terms of the Sunstone Financial Group, Inc. Parallel Stock Unit Plan and
     the terms of the related option agreements with the Option Holders and the
     Option Payout Agreements (as defined below), and (ii) promissory notes in
     the form attached to those certain agreements between the Company and each
     Option Holder (the "Option Payout Agreement," the form and content of such
     agreements and attached notes being subject to Buyer's written approval
     prior to Closing) to be executed and delivered by the Company and each
     Option Holder at Closing. In order to finance the first installment under
     the Option Payout Agreements, the Buyer shall, prior to the Closing Date,
     make a loan to the Company in the principal amount of $630,000 on terms
     determined by the Buyer (but consistent with the terms of this Section),
     and the Company shall use the proceeds to make such first installment
     payments. This borrowing by the Company shall not be deemed a violation of
     any covenant, or the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
     Sellers, in the Agreement. No Seller shall have any obligation to repay the
     indebtedness associated with this borrowing, except as set forth in Section
     5.12.

          (b) Seller Notes. Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers at Closing, pro
     rata in accordance with their ownership of stock of the Company: (i) cash,
     by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated by
     each Seller, in a total amount designated by Sellers in written notice
     delivered to Buyer at least one (1) business day prior to Closing, which
     total amount shall be equal to the lesser of (A) $3,000,000 or (B) the
     amount that generates taxable gain to the Company such that when the gain
     is allocated to Miriam Meyer Allison ("Ms. Allison") pro rata in accordance
     with her ownership of stock of the Company, the gain allocated to her will
     be an amount equal to her allocable share of the taxable loss of the
     Company for the period beginning January 1, 2001 and ending immediately
     prior to the Closing plus any "suspended" taxable losses for periods ending
     prior to January 1, 2001; (ii) a promissory note (the "Initial Seller
     Note") in substantially the form of Exhibit C attached hereto and
     incorporated herein by reference, in the principal amount set forth
     opposite each Seller's name on Exhibit A, less the amount of cash to be
     received by such individual pursuant to subsection (i) above.

          (c) Earn-Out Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section 1(f)
     hereof, pay to the Sellers in five (5) annual installments (commencing one
     (1) year from the first Annual Date (as defined below)), cash (the
     "Earn-Out Payments") in accordance with the earnout formula set forth in
     Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The
     aggregate amount of all of the Earn-Out Payments to be made to Sellers
     (collectively) in each given annual installment shall be determined as
     provided for in Exhibit D, and then such aggregate amount shall be
     apportioned among the Sellers according to the percentages set forth in
     Exhibit D. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall make
     such Earn-Out Payments within 75 days after the end of each of the five
     12-month periods by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
     available funds (each, an "Earn-out Period") specified in Exhibit D and in
     accordance with the formula set forth in Exhibit D. For purposes of this
     subsection (c), the term "Annual Date" shall refer to whichever of the
     following two days is closer in time to the Closing date: (a) the first day
     of the first month of the calendar quarter in which Closing occurs, or (b)
     the day following the last day of the third month of the calendar quarter
     in

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

     which Closing occurs. Each Earn-out Period listed on Exhibit D shall
     consist of the 12-month period immediately preceding the Annual Date of the
     year referenced in the first column on Exhibit D. For purposes of the
     formula set forth on Exhibit D, "Gross Revenues" for any given Earn-out
     Period consist of the sums accrued by Company and Subsidiary (as defined in
     Section 3.1) during such Earn-out Period representing payments due from
     customers in consideration of goods and services provided to such customers
     by Company and Subsidiary, as calculated in a manner consistent with the
     Company's audited financial statements for the period ending December 31,
     2000 and attached hereto as Exhibit E and incorporated herein by reference;
     provided, however, that such Gross Revenues shall specifically (i) include
     revenues in respect of the Company or Subsidiary's (x) providing services
     to the Buyer's proprietary Scout Funds as listed on Exhibit F attached
     hereto; (y) fund accounting servicing of transferred Buyer portfolios as
     listed on Exhibit F attached hereto; and (z) any "Related UMB Revenue" (as
     defined below); and shall (i) exclude all reimbursements representing
     advances or expense reimbursements (including reimbursement for filing
     fees, printing, professional fees, etc.) due or received by Company or
     Subsidiary from customers and all other sums described as "Client
     Distribution Revenue" in Company's unaudited internal operating statements
     (a copy of which relating to the month of January, 2001 being attached
     hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein by reference), and (ii) be
     reduced, by the amount of any receivables that were previously included in
     the gross revenues of the Company and/or Subsidiary but were written off or
     otherwise determined to be uncollectable during the respective Earn-out
     Period ("Write-Offs"), all as determined in a manner consistent with
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Sellers agree and
     acknowledge that Buyer, as the owner of the Company, will have the right to
     accept or reject any business proposed to be conducted by the Company and
     to modify any pricing structures of the Company; provided, that such right
     of acceptance or rejection and right to modify shall be exercised in good
     faith and in a commercially reasonable manner; and provided, further., that
     Buyer shall comply with the provisions of Article VI hereof.

     For purposes of subsection (z) above, the term "Related UMB Revenue" shall
     consist of the following revenues accrued (less any such revenues written
     off) by UMB Bank N.A ("UMB") during the relevant time period:

               (i) Revenues in consideration of UMB providing custody and/or
          cash management services ("UMB Services") to a fund to whom Company or
          Subsidiary hereafter provides for the first time (Oberweis Funds being
          expressly included); one or more of its core transfer agency services,
          fund accounting services, distribution services, administration
          services or marketing services (the "Core Services"), if UMB was not
          providing UMB Services to such fund prior to the date of this
          Agreement;

               (ii) Revenues in consideration of UMB providing UMB Services to a
          new fund hereafter created by a customer to whom Company or Subsidiary
          currently provides one or more Core Services;

               (iii) Revenues representing cash deposit fees, IRA custody fees,
          or related bank fees in consideration of UMB providing UMB Services to
          any fund

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

          for which Company or Subsidiary is hereafter appointed as transfer
          agent, if UMB is not already providing UMB Services to such fund.

          If a fund agrees with UMB to utilize account balances and earnings
          credits to effect payment of the qualifying revenues, then the amount
          of such earning credits granted by UMB and used by the fund to effect
          such payments shall be included within the UMB Related Revenue.

          (d) Resolution of Earn-Out Disputes. Buyer shall cause the Company to,
     within sixty (60) days after the end of each of the five (5) Earn-out
     Periods specified in Exhibit D, give the Sellers work papers and other
     information reasonably requested by such parties reasonably detailing the
     Buyer's determination of the cash that each Seller is entitled to receive
     as the Earn-out Payment. If Sellers have any objection to such
     determination, they must, within thirty (30) business days after receipt of
     the notice, give written notice ("Earn-Out Notice") to Buyer specifying in
     reasonable detail the Sellers' objections to Buyer's determination of the
     Earn-Out Payment. Failure to provide such Earn-Out Notice within such
     30-day period shall constitute Seller's agreement and acceptance of the
     determination as provided by Buyer. The parties shall meet in person and
     negotiate in good faith during the thirty (30) business-day period (the
     "Earn-Out Resolution Period") after the date of Buyer's receipt of any
     Earn-Out Notice to resolve the Sellers' objections. If the parties are
     unable to resolve all such disputes within the Earn-Out Resolution Period,
     then within ten (10) business days after the expiration of the Earn-Out
     Resolution Period, all disputes shall be submitted to a mutually-agreed
     upon independent accountant (the "Independent Accountant"), who shall be
     engaged to provide a final and conclusive resolution of all unresolved
     disputes within thirty (30) business days after such engagement. The
     Independent Accountant's determination shall be limited to the specific
     components of the earn-out formula that are in dispute and shall not result
     in a recalculation of the earn-out formula set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
     The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
     conclusive on the parties hereto, and the fees and expenses of the
     Independent Accountant shall be borne by Sellers unless the audit discloses
     that the proposed Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Resolution Period is
     incorrect by more than ten percent (10%), in which case, Buyer shall pay
     the reasonable fees and expenses charged by the Independent Accountant.

          (e) Purchase Price. The payments made in accordance with Section
     1.2(b) - (d) shall collectively constitute the purchase price (the
     "Purchase Price").

          (f) Earn-Out Payment Adjustment. Notwithstanding the provisions of
     this Agreement, the Earn-Out Payment to be made during the first Earn-Out
     Period (and any subsequent Earn Out Period, if necessary to implement the
     adjustment described below) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
     "Adjusted Operating Loss" (as defined below), if any, of the Company during
     the first such Earn-Out Period. The Adjusted Operating Loss will be
     calculated by (i) taking the Company's pre-tax profit or loss (after
     excluding any Client Distribution Revenue) reflected on the Company's
     financial statement for the first Earn-Out Period (prepared in accordance
     with GAAP and consistently with past practices); (ii) adding any Related
     UMB Revenue for such period;

                                       -4-

<PAGE>

     (iii) subtracting any Write-Offs occurring during such period; and (iv)
     adding the difference between (A) the actual interest due UMB on loans made
     to the Company or Subsidiary to pay off the promissory notes owed to Park
     Bank and other indebtedness mutually agreed to from time to time by Buyer
     and Ms. Allison (collectively, "Repaid Debt"), and (B) the "Carrying Cost"
     of such Repaid Debt during such period. For purposes of this subsection,
     the "Carrying Cost" of the Repaid Debt shall be calculated by multiplying
     the amount of the Repaid Debt repaid by, or on behalf of, the Company on or
     after Closing, by the prime rate announced from time to time by UMB Bank,
     N.A., minus 200 basis points, for those periods of time commencing when
     each portion of the Repaid Debt is repaid and ending on April 1, 2002. (No
     adjustment to the Earn-Out Payments will be made if there is no Adjusted
     Operating Loss applicable to the first Earn-Out Period.)

     For purposes of calculating the Adjusted Operating Loss, no general charges
     or allocations to the Company shall be assessed by Buyer or its affiliates
     for administrative services, overhead, management fees or other similar
     expenses that Buyer generally allocates to its subsidiaries; provided
     however, that Buyer or its affiliates may charge the Company (and such
     charges shall be treated as an expense of the Company for purposes of
     calculating its Adjusted Operating Loss) for (a) services actually provided
     by Buyer or its affiliates, but only to the extent (and in comparable
     amounts) that such charges are assessed against independent third-party
     customers for comparable goods or services under similar circumstances, and
     (b) the annual cost of any equipment, software or services purchased by
     Buyer or its subsidiaries for the primary use and benefit of the Company,
     but purchased and held on Buyer's or such subsidiaries' books for capital
     or other business purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
     agree and acknowledge that the Adjusted Operating Loss shall not exceed
     Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00).

          (g) Earn-Out Payments in Event of Death. In the event of Ms. Allison's
     death during the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall cause any Earn-Out Payments
     due to Ms. Allison to be paid to the Miriam M. and Daniel S. Allison
     Revocable Trust dated June 4, 1991, as amended.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                     CLOSING

          Section 2.1 Time and Place. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, the closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Shook, Hardy &
Bacon L.L.P., 1010 Grand Blvd., 5th Floor, Kansas City, Missouri, beginning at
noon Central Standard Time, on (a) April 17, 2001 or (b) at such other place,
time or later date as may be agreed upon by the parties. The actual date of the
Closing is sometimes referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

     provided in Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Statutes and the cases
     decided thereunder, and no Shares are held in the Company's treasury. All
     of the Shares are held by the Sellers as set forth on Schedule 3.2 hereto.

     cancellations, transfers, splits and other transactions involving or
     affecting the capital stock of the Company. The Option Rights are the only

     and/or Subsidiary. The cash payment made at Closing pursuant to Section

     is bound relating to the units or interests in or other securities of
     Subsidiary. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will lawfully own
     all Subsidiary Units (and all other interests in Subsidiary), of record and
     beneficially, free and clear of all liabilities, obligations, claims,
     liens, pledges, contractual rights, security interests, options, charges,
     encumbrances and restrictions of any kind whatsoever.

bond, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness, and is not otherwise a
creditor, of any entity listed on Schedule 3.4. The Company has no subsidiaries,
except as set forth on Schedule 3.4.

          Section 3.5 Consents; No Violation.

          (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5, neither the execution nor
     delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions

     valid grounds to cause (with or without notice, the passage of time or
     both), the maturity of any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or
     Subsidiary to be accelerated, or will increase any such liability or
     obligation or will result in the imposition of any lien, encumbrance,

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance of and compliance with
     this Agreement by Seller and the sale and transfer of the Shares to be sold

     that it was required to file. All such Tax Returns were correct and

     Company or the Subsidiary has knowledge based upon personal contact with
     any agent of such authority. Schedule 3.9 lists those Tax Returns filed
     after December 31, 1996, that have been audited, and indicates those Tax
     Returns that currently are the subject of audit. The Sellers have delivered
     to the Buyer correct and

     obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that under
     certain circumstances could obligate it to make any payments that will not
     be deductible under Code Sec. 162 (as unreasonable compensation), Code Sec.
     162(m) or Code Sec. 280G, except that no representation or warranty is made
     with respect to any payment to be made to any Option Holder. Neither the
     Company nor the Subsidiary is party to any Tax allocation or sharing
     agreement. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary (A) has been a member of
     an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or (B)
     has any liability for the Taxes of any person or entity (other than the
     Company or the Subsidiary), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
     otherwise.

          (f) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiary did not, as of
     the date of the Balance Sheet exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather
     than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
     differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
     Balance Sheet (defined herein as the December 31, 2000, balance sheet for
     the Audited Financial Statements) (rather than in any notes thereto); the
     parties acknowledge, however, that there has been no reserve established in
     the Balance Sheet for income taxes.

          (g) Since the date of the Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor the
     Subsidiary has incurred any liabilities for Taxes except in the ordinary
     course of business.

          (h) The Company has been a validly electing S corporation within the
     meaning of Code Sec. 1361 and 1362 at all times during its existence, and
     the Company will be an S corporation up to and including the Closing Date.

          (i) The Company has no subsidiary that is a "qualified subchapter S
     subsidiary" within the meaning of Code Sec. 1361(b)(3)(B).

          (j) The Company will not be liable for any Tax under Code Sec. 1374 in
     connection with the deemed sale of the Company's assets caused by the
     Section 338(h)(10) election. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has, in
     the last 10 years, (A) acquired assets (other than certain assets acquired
     by Subsidiary from the Company upon its formation) from another corporation
     in a transaction in which the Company's or Subsidiary's Tax basis for the
     acquired assets was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the
     Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of
     the transferor or (B) acquired the stock of any corporation which is a
     qualified subchapter S subsidiary.

                                      -14-

          (k) At all times during its existence, the Subsidiary has been treated
     as an entity that is "disregarded as an entity separate from its owner" in
     accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii), and this
     treatment will continue up to and including the Closing Date.

          For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

          "Tax" means any federal, state, local or foreign income, gross
receipts, license, payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation,
premium, windfall profits, environmental (including taxes under Code Sec. 59A),
customs duties, capital stock, franchise, profits, withholding, social security
(or similar), unemployment disability, real property, personal property, sales,
use, transfer, registration, value added, alternative or add-on minimum,
estimated, or other tax of any kind whatsoever, including any interest, penalty,
or additional thereto, whether disputed or not.

          "Tax Return" means any return, declaration, report, claim or refund,
or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule or
attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

          Section 3.10 Real Property. Neither the Company nor Subsidiary owns
any real property in fee simple. Schedule 3.10(a) sets forth a list of all real
property leased by the Company and/or Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Properties"). The Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, holds a good and
valid leasehold title and estate in the Properties, in each case free and clear
of all mortgages, deeds of trust, pledges, liens, security interests, claims,
mechanic's or materialmen's liens, charges, easements, restrictive covenants,
rights-of-way and other encumbrances, other than for Permitted Encumbrances. As
used herein, "Permitted Encumbrances" means liens for Taxes not yet due or which
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP, municipal and
zoning ordinances and easements of record, utility easements for utilities
serving the property of record, and any similar encumbrances, none of which
interfere with the use of such Properties as currently utilized.

The Company hereby represents that:

          (a) Neither the Company nor Subsidiary has received written notice (i)
     that any of the Properties (or the buildings, structures or improvements
     thereon), or the operations of Company or Subsidiary violate the zoning or
     planning laws, ordinances, rules or regulations of the city, county or
     state in which they are located, or any building regulations or codes of
     such city, county or state, or land use laws or regulations applicable to
     the Properties, or (ii) of any claims of others to rights over, under,
     across or through any of the Properties by virtue of use or prescription;

          (b) All permits, approvals, authorizations or licenses required or
     necessary for the use of any of the Properties to the extent required of
     the Company have been obtained and are in full force and effect;

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

          (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(d), neither the Company nor
     Subsidiary has sublet, nor is subletting, all or any part of any of the
     Properties, nor has assigned all or any part of its interests in any of the
     leases.

          (d) Schedule 3.10(d) sets forth a list of all service and maintenance
     contracts affecting the Properties and all utility and management contracts
     affecting the Properties to which the Company or Subsidiary is a party and
     which in any individual contract obligate the Company or Subsidiary to pay
     more than $5,000 in any year. All such contracts are currently in full
     force and effect, and, as to the Company or Subsidiary, and to Sellers'
     knowledge, as to third parties, there is no default, or action or omission
     which with the giving of notice or passage of time or both would constitute
     a default thereunder. Copies of all such contracts have been delivered to
     Buyer. In addition, the Sellers have previously delivered to the Buyer
     copies of the most recently issued bills for real estate tax assessments
     against any or all of the Properties;

          (e) All the Properties are free and clear of any agreements to
     sublease (or to grant an assignment of lease), options to sublease (or to
     grant an assignment of lease) or rights of first refusal relating thereto.
     All real property with respect to which the Company or Subsidiary has an
     agreement to purchase, lease or sublease, option to purchase, lease, or
     sublease or right of first refusal relating thereto is set forth on
     Schedule 3.10(e);

          (f) To Sellers' knowledge, all the Properties are currently zoned in
     the zoning category which permits operation of said Properties as now used,
     operated and maintained;

          (g) To Sellers' knowledge, the Properties currently have access to all
     gas, water, electricity, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, telephone and all
     other utilities necessary or beneficial to the current operation of the
     Properties, and all of such utilities are adequate and sufficient for the
     current operation of the Properties;

          (h) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(h), and except for repair and
     maintenance in the ordinary course of business, no construction,
     improvements, or expansion is currently on-going at any of the Properties,
     and Company and/or Subsidiary have accepted possession of the Properties;

          (i) The Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, holds a valid
     leasehold estate pursuant to each lease by which the Properties are leased,
     as shown on Schedule 3.10(h), and enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
     possession thereunder. The Sellers have previously delivered to the Buyer
     complete and accurate copies of all such scheduled leases. All such leases
     are valid, binding, and enforceable, as to the Company or Subsidiary and to
     Sellers' knowledge, as to third parties, in accordance with their terms,
     and are in full force and effect, the Company and/or Subsidiary has
     complied with all obligations thereunder, and there are no existing
     defaults by the Company and/or Subsidiary, and to Sellers' knowledge, there
     are no existing defaults by any other party thereunder. No event has
     occurred which (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the
     happening or occurrence of any other event) would constitute a default by
     the Company and/or Subsidiary, and no event has occurred to Sellers'
     knowledge, which (whether with or

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

     without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other
     event) would constitute a default by any other party thereunder. All such
     leases shall continue in full force and effect (without default) after the
     Closing and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     without the consent, approval or act of any other party, except as set
     forth in Schedule 3.5;

          (j) To the Seller's knowledge, there are no proposed, pending or
     threatened proceedings or governmental or quasi-governmental actions to
     condemn or take by the power of eminent domain (or to purchase in lieu
     thereof), or otherwise to take or restrict the right to use or occupy, any
     of the Properties; and

          (k) Neither the Sellers, the Company nor Subsidiary has received
     written notice that it is in violation of any applicable antipollution,
     health or other law, ordinance or regulation in respect of the Properties
     or their operation, which violation remains uncured, and to Sellers'
     knowledge, no such violation exists.

          Section 3.11 Intellectual Property.

          (a) Schedule 3.11 contains an accurate and complete description of all
     domestic and foreign URL registrations, patents, patent applications,
     patent licenses, shop rights, trademarks, trademark registrations and
     applications therefor, service marks, service mark registrations and
     applications therefor, logos, trade names, assumed names, copyright
     registrations and applications therefor, and registered domain names, which
     are used by the Company or Subsidiary, or which are presently owned or held
     by the Company or Subsidiary or under which the Company or Subsidiary owns
     or holds any license, or in which the Company or Subsidiary owns or holds
     any direct or indirect interest, other than those rights granted to Buyer
     hereunder (collectively, the "Intellectual Property Rights"). Schedule 3.11
     further sets forth: (i) the nature of such Intellectual Property Rights;
     (ii) the owner of such Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) the jurisdiction
     by or in which such Intellectual Property Rights has been issued or
     registered or in which an application for such issuance or registration has
     been filed, including the respective registration or application numbers;
     and (iv) licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to which the Company
     is a party and pursuant to which the Company, or any other person or entity
     is authorized to use such Intellectual Property Rights, process, design,
     invention, know-how, trade secret or other proprietary information
     (collectively, the "Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property").

          (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11, neither the Company nor
     Subsidiary infringes or unlawfully or wrongly uses any patent, trademark,
     trade name, service mark, copyright, trade secret, confidential or
     proprietary right or any similar rights owned or claimed by another.

          (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11, neither the Company nor
     Subsidiary knows of any use that has been or is now being made by another
     of the Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property or that would infringe such
     rights, or would prevent the unrestricted use thereof by Buyer.

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

          (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11, (i) the Company or the
     Subsidiary, as the case may be, is the sole and exclusive owner of or
     possesses valid licenses and rights to use all Company/Subsidiary
     Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the businesses of the Company
     and the Subsidiary as are currently being conducted, and (ii) such
     ownership or right to use under licenses will not be adversely affected as
     a result of the execution of this Agreement and consummation of the
     transactions provided for herein.

          (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11, neither the Company nor
     Subsidiary has sold, licensed or otherwise disposed of or transferred or
     granted any interest in the Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property. The
     Company and/or Subsidiary has taken all reasonable measures, which may or
     may not have included the institution of litigation, to maintain and
     protect the Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property and, to Sellers'
     knowledge, all such rights remain valid and enforceable.

          (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(g), to Sellers' knowledge, no
     claims have been asserted by any person to the use or validity of any of
     the Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property or challenging or questioning
     the validity or effectiveness of any license or agreement related thereto,
     and to Sellers' knowledge, there is no valid basis for any such claim. None
     of the Company/Subsidiary Intellectual Property is subject to any
     outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement restricting
     the use thereof by the Company and/or Subsidiary or restricting the
     licensing thereof by the Company/Subsidiary to any other person or entity.
     Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11, neither the Company and/or Subsidiary
     has entered into any agreement to indemnify any other person or entity
     against any charge of infringement of any Company/Subsidiary Intellectual
     Property.

          (g) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11, (i) neither the Company nor
     the Subsidiary has any systems and applications computer programs which
     were developed by, or on behalf of, the Company or the Subsidiary (the
     "Software Programs."); (ii) the systems and applications computer programs
     of the Company and Subsidiary and the technical documentation and
     inventories of the Software Programs were developed by personnel, including
     employees, agents, consultants and contractors, on behalf of the Company
     and such parties (A) entered into "work-for-hire" arrangements or
     agreements with the Company, in accordance with applicable federal and
     state law, that has accorded the Company full, effective exclusive, and
     original ownership of all tangible and intangible property thereby arising;
     or (B) executed appropriate instruments of assignment in favor of the
     Company as assignee that conveyed to the Company full, effective and
     exclusive ownership of all tangible and intangible property thereby
     arising; (iii) the technical documentation for the Software Programs
     includes the source code, system documentation, statements of principles of
     operation, and schematics for all Software Programs, as well as any
     pertinent commentary or explanation that may be necessary to render such
     materials understandable and usable by a trained computer programmer; (iv)

     compilers), "workbenches," tools and higher level (or "proprietary")
     language used for the development, maintenance and implementation of the
     Software Programs; (v) the Company has validly and effectively obtained the
     right and license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the third-party
     programming and materials contained in the Software

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

     Programs and technical documentation; (vi) the Software Programs and
     technical documentation contain no other programming or materials in which
     any third party may claim superior, joint, or common ownership, including
     any right or license; (vii) the Software Programs and technical
     documentation do not contain derivative works of any programming or
     materials not owned in their entirety by Company and Subsidiary; (viii)
     neither Company nor Subsidiary have granted, transferred, or assigned any
     right or interest in the Software Programs or the technical documentation
     to any person or entity; and (ix) there are no contracts, agreements,
     licenses, and other commitments and arrangements in effect with respect to
     the marketing, distribution, licensing or promotion of the Software
     Programs or the technical documentation by any independent salesperson,
     distributor, sublicensor or other remarketer or sales organization.

          Section 3.12 Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in Schedule
3.12, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding pending or to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened, nor is there any
valid basis for any claim, against the Company, Subsidiary or any of their
properties before any court or arbitrator or any administrative, regulatory or
governmental body, or any agency or official. Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.12, as of the date hereof, neither the Company, Subsidiary nor any of their
property is subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award.

          Section 3.13 Insurance.

          (a) Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a complete and correct list of all
     insurance policies (including a brief summary of the nature and terms
     thereof and any amounts paid or payable to the Company or Subsidiary
     thereunder, their respective expiration dates, deductibles and stop-loss
     thresholds) providing coverage in favor of the Company, Subsidiary or any
     of their respective officers, directors, employees or properties. Each such
     policy is valid, in full force and effect and will remain in full force and
     effect at least through the respective dates set forth in Schedule 3.13(a)
     without the payment of additional premiums other than additional premiums
     in the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing. No notice of
     termination, cancellation or reservation of rights has been received with
     respect to any such policy, there is no default with respect to any
     provision contained in any such policy, and except as set forth on Schedule
     3.13(a), there has not been any failure to give any notice or present any
     claim under any such policy in a timely fashion or in the manner or detail
     required by any such policy.

          (b) The Company and Subsidiary have insurance in an amount and of a
     type normal in the ordinary course for similar-sized businesses similar to
     the Company and Subsidiary. Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.13(b),
     neither the Company nor Subsidiary has received notice of any proposed
     increase in premiums or deductible amounts, decrease in coverage or
     termination of any policy.

          Section 3.14 Employee Benefits.

<PAGE>

     insurance, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension,
     savings or retirement plan, program, agreement or arrangement, cafeteria
     plans within the meaning of section 125 of the Code, retiree medical plans
     and any trust fund, plan, program or arrangement funding any plan
     (including any voluntary employee beneficiary association within the
     meaning of section 501(c)(9) of the Code), and each other employee benefit
     plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or
     contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any
     subsidiary for the benefit of any employee or terminated employee of the
     Company or any subsidiary (all of such plans, programs, agreements and
     arrangements included in this Section 3.14(a) being referred to hereinafter
     collectively as the "Plans" and individually as a "Plan"). Schedule 3.14(a)
     identifies each of the Plans that is an "employee benefit plan," as that
     term is defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
     Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (the "ERISA Plans").

          (b) With respect to each Plan, the Sellers have heretofore delivered
     to Buyer true and complete copies of each of the following documents (to
     the extent applicable):

               (i)  a copy thereof;

               (ii) a copy of the three most recent Form 5500 annual reports and
          accompanying accountants' reports;

               (iii) a copy of the most recent Summary Plan Description,
          summaries of all modifications, administrative forms and other
          documents that constitute a part of or are incident to the
          administration of the Plans;

               (iv) copies of any insurance contracts and administrative service
          contracts;

               (v) if the Plan is funded through a trust or any third party
          funding vehicle, a copy of the trust or other funding agreement and
          the latest financial statements thereof,

               (vi) the most recent determination letter received from the
          Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Plan intended to qualify
          under section 401 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
          (the "Code") and any pending determination letter request; and

               (vii) Schedule 3.14(a) also shall contain a written description
          of all communications regarding any Plan to employees or former
          employees with respect to this transaction.

          (c) Neither the Company, any subsidiary nor any Affiliate of the
     Company, as determined under Code Section 414(b), (c) or (m) or ERISA
     Section 4001(b) (an "ERISA Affiliate") or predecessor to any of the
     foregoing maintains or has ever maintained a plan which is or was subject
     to (i) the minimum funding requirements of ERISA or the Code or (ii) Title
     IV of ERISA.

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

          (d) Neither the Company, any subsidiary, nor any ERISA Affiliate, nor
     any ERISA Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
     administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
     the Company, any subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate, any ERISA Plan, any
     such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing
     with any ERISA Plan or any such trust could be in violation of sections
     404, 405, or 406 of ERISA or could be subject to either a civil penalty
     assessed pursuant to section 409, 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA or a Tax
     imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of the Code.

          (e) No ERISA Plan is a "multi-employer plan," as defined in section
     3(37) of ERISA, nor is any ERISA Plan a plan described in section 4063(a)
     of ERISA. Neither the Company, any subsidiary, nor any ERISA Affiliate or
     predecessor to any of the foregoing has ever maintained, contributed to or
     been required to contribute to a "multi-employer plan" as defined in
     section 3(37) of ERISA.

          (f) Each Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with
     its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the
     Code.

          (g) Each ERISA Plan intended to be qualified within the meaning of
     section 401(a) of the Code and each related trust intended to be qualified
     within the meaning of section 501(a) of the Code has been established and
     operated so as to be qualified and tax-exempt under such sections. Nothing
     has occurred or, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, will occur, which would adversely affect the qualified status of
     such plans and trusts. In the event the Company, any subsidiary or any
     affiliated entity sponsors or maintains a voluntary employee beneficiary
     association within the meaning of section 501(c)(9) of the Code, all
     necessary governmental approvals for obtaining tax exempt status have been
     obtained, and such determination letter is dated on or after January 1,
     1985.

          (h) No amounts payable under any Plan as a result of or in connection
     with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by application
     of section 162(m), section 280G or section 404 of the Code.

          (i) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(i), no Plan provides
     benefits, including without limitation death or medical benefits (whether
     or not insured), with respect to current or former employees (and their
     dependents) of the Company, any subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate beyond
     their retirement or other termination of service other than continued
     medical coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code.

          (j) Except as provided in Schedule 3.14(j), the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any
     current or former employee or officer of the Company, any subsidiary, or
     any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
     other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or (ii)
     accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
     compensation due any such employee or officer.

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

          (k) There are no pending or threatened claims by or on behalf of any
     Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or
     otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

          (1) The Company and Subsidiary has reserved the right to amend or
     terminate any Plan.

          (m) Neither the Company nor Subsidiary has announced any plan or
     legally binding commitment to create any additional Plans which are
     intended to cover employees or former employees of the Company or
     Subsidiary or to amend or modify any existing Plan which covers or has
     covered employees or former employees of the Company or Subsidiary.

          (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15, (i) all of the Commitments,
as to the Company or Subsidiary and to Sellers' knowledge, as to third parties,
are valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms and there is no existing default, as to the Company
or Subsidiary and to Sellers' knowledge, as to third parties, that would permit
the other party to a Commitment to terminate the Commitment, not to perform its

condition exists that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on any Commitment, by the Company, Subsidiary, or to the Sellers'
knowledge, any other party under any Commitment; (ii) all of Company's and to

knowledge, has been threatened to be made the subject of, any arbitration, suit
or other legal proceeding. Except as noted on Schedule 3.15, nothing in any
contract listed on such schedule prohibits the consummation of the Agreement,
and the consummation of the transactions provided for in this Agreement will not
cause a termination of or default under any such contract.

          (c) With respect to Commitments involving trust accounts or other
accounts over which Company or Subsidiary has any access or control which
contain funds belonging to any Fund or other third party, the accounts in which

provisions and requirements of such Commitments and the duties and rights of the
Company or Subsidiary thereunder and with respect thereto. All deposits,
withdrawals and transfers by or at the direction of Company or Subsidiary have
been made consistent with their obligations under, and the provision of, the
Commitments and other agreements and obligations relating to such accounts and
funds to which Company or Subsidiary are a party or are bound. The balance of
such accounts held or controlled by the Company on the Closing Date will be
equal in all material respects to the amount required to be held at such time
under and pursuant to such Commitments and otherwise with respect to the
Business. The Company has, and as of the Closing Date shall have, reserved for
fiduciary tax liabilities in accordance with such Commitments, if required.

     the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange Act") and all
     applicable State broker-dealer laws and is a member in good standing with
     the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"). Prior to
     engaging in any activities requiring it to be registered as a securities

     since has been, a duly registered broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and
     the Rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and duly registered or

     bodies), as well as all applicable policies, obligations, descriptions and
     restrictions, including but not limited to those under the Exchange Act.

          (b) There are no legal or governmental investigations of Company or
     Subsidiary pending, or to Sellers', Company's or Subsidiary's knowledge,
     threatened, which would question the right of Subsidiary to act as
     broker-dealer. There are no special restrictions, judgments or SEC orders
     with regard to Subsidiary currently in effect that have a material adverse
     effect on the business or operations of Subsidiary. No orders of exemption
     have been issued to Subsidiary by any federal or state regulatory agency.

          (c) Neither the Company or Subsidiary are required to be registered
     under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment
     Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

          (d) Although Company and Subsidiary are not required to comply with
     Section 17(j) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and Rule
     17j-1 thereunder,

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

     Company and Subsidiary have adopted formal codes of ethics and written
     policies regarding insider trading. Except for the annual and initial
     holding report and certification requirements (which the Company and
     Subsidiary are not required to comply with), such codes and policies comply
     in all material respects with Section 17(j) of the Investment Company Act
     of 1940, as amended, and Rule 17j-1 thereunder. Other than as disclosed on
     Schedule 3.26(d), there have been no violations of the aforesaid codes and
     policies.

          (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.26(f), neither the Company,
     Subsidiary or any Person "associated" (as defined under the Investment
     Advisers Act of 1940, as amended) with the Company or Subsidiary, has in
     the last ten (10) years been convicted of any crime or is or has been
     subject to any disqualification that would be the basis for denial,
     suspension or revocation of a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the
     Exchange Act, and there is no proceeding or investigation that is
     reasonably likely to become the basis for any such disqualification,
     denial, suspension or revocation.

          substantially different than that which has existed during the
          two-year period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement;

               (xvi) cancel, waive or compromise any right or debt or obligation
          owed or due to it by any client, customer, employee, officer or other

               (xvii) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to take any action

Subject to applicable law and the agreements set forth in Section 5.1(a),
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Sellers will, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice: give Buyer and its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

representatives reasonable access to all employees, landlords, suppliers,
customers (provided that Ms. Allison or her designee is present during
discussions with customers), vendors, plants, offices, warehouses and other
facilities and to all books and records of the Company and Subsidiary; will
permit Buyer and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to make such inspections as Buyer may reasonably require; and
will cause the officers of the Company and Subsidiary to furnish Buyer or its
representatives with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business and properties of the Company and Subsidiary as
Buyer may from time to time reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.1(b) shall affect any representations or warranties of the
parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.
Sellers shall, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice:
cause the Company and Subsidiary to permit Buyer to meet with their employees,
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, to discuss retention and other
relevant issues pertaining to operations following Closing. Sellers will
promptly notify Buyer if it learns or has reason to believe that any customer or
client of Company or Subsidiary has terminated or is contemplating a termination
of any contract or agreement with Company or Subsidiary or any other material
change in its business relationship (including a significant change in fees or
revenues paid by the client or customer to Company or Subsidiary) with Company
or Subsidiary. Sellers will also immediately inform Buyer if they learn or have
reason to believe any investigation or proceeding (legal or regulatory) is
instituted or is being contemplated or threatened against Company or Subsidiary.
Buyer will keep confidential and not divulge (except to its employees, counsel,
accountants and other advisors who need to know such information in connection
with this Agreement and who agree to keep confidential and not divulge, or as
may be required by law or order of a court or regulatory agency or body) any
confidential information obtained by it regarding the business and finances of
the Company and Subsidiary; provided, however, that this prohibition will not
include any information (i) known generally to the public, or (ii) accessible to
third parties on an unrestricted basis. Sellers will cause Company and
Subsidiary to not enter into any new contracts or agreements with any client or
customer (or materially amend any existing such contracts or agreements) without
Buyer's prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall promptly
return all such confidential information to the Sellers if this Agreement is
terminated.

          Section 5.2 Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its, his or her
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with one another (i) in
determining whether action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental
body, agency, official or authority (either domestic or foreign) is required,
proper or advisable or any actions, consents, waivers or approvals are required
to be obtained from parties to any contracts, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in timely seeking to obtain
any such actions, consents and waivers and to make any such filings. In case at
any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each
party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

          Section 5.3 Public Announcements; Notification of Certain Matters.
Buyer and the Sellers will consult with each other, and obtain the other's
consent, before issuing any

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

press release or other publicly-disseminated statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by
applicable law, by applicable rules of any securities exchange, as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain the third-party consents required of the Sellers
hereunder, or to the Company's and Subsidiary's clients or prospective clients.
The Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt
notice to the Sellers, upon becoming aware of (i) the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate, (ii) any fact which was in existence on the date of this Agreement
and, if known on such date, would have been required to be set forth as
described on the Schedules hereto, and (iii) any failure of the Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

          Section 5.4 No Solicitation.

          (a) The Sellers are not engaged in and will not engage in, or allow
     the Company or Subsidiary to engage in, any discussions or negotiations
     with any third parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
     below). Neither the Company nor the Sellers shall, directly or indirectly,
     through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent (as
     applicable), (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals
     that constitute, or would lead to, a proposal or offer for a sale of common
     stock, a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial
     assets, sale of a substantial percentage of shares of capital stock
     (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar
     transactions involving the Company or Subsidiary, other than the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing inquiries
     or proposals being referred to in this Agreement as an "Acquisition
     Proposal"), (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or
     provide any non-public information to any person or entity relating to, any
     Acquisition Proposal or (iii) agree to, approve or recommend any
     Acquisition Proposal.

          (b) The Sellers shall notify Buyer promptly after receipt by the
     Company or the Sellers of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
     non-public information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for
     access to the properties, books or records of the Company or Subsidiary by
     any person or entity that informs the Company, Subsidiary or the Sellers
     that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such
     notice shall indicate the identity of the offeror and the terms and
     conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact.

     The Sellers' obligations under this Section 5.4 shall terminate upon the
     earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof
     or the Closing.

                                      -34-

          Section 5.5 Insurance. The Sellers shall cause the Company and
Subsidiary to maintain the insurance coverage specified in Section 3.13 hereto
in full force and effect through the Closing.

          Section 5.6 Consents of Third Parties. The Sellers shall obtain, prior
to Closing, consents of all third parties to change of control of the Company
and Subsidiary with respect to all leases, licenses, product and establishment
registrations, contracts and commitments that require such consents.

          Section 5.7 Taxes.

          (a) The Company and each of the Sellers will, if Buyer so requests,
     join with Buyer in making a timely election under IRS Code Sec. 338(h)(10)
     (and any corresponding election under state, local, and foreign tax law)
     with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Company hereunder
     (a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). If Buyer so requests, the Sellers agree
     to cooperate fully in order to make the Section 338(h)(l0) Election valid,
     including but not limited to, the filing of Form 8023 and any accompanying
     statements or schedules that may be required. Sellers will include any
     income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Section
     338(h)(l0) Election on their Tax Returns to the extent required by
     applicable law. Sellers shall also pay any Tax imposed on the Company or
     its subsidiaries attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
     Election, including, but not limited to, (i) any Tax imposed under Code
     Sec. 1374, (ii) any tax imposed under Treas. Reg. (S)1.338(h)(10)-IT(d)(2),
     or (iii) any state, local or foreign tax imposed on the Company's gain, and
     Sellers shall indemnify Buyer and the Company against (i) any adverse
     consequences arising out of any failure to pay any such Taxes, and (ii)
     against any income Tax of the Sellers, the Company or the Subsidiary
     incurred during the period up to and including the Closing Date. As
     described in Section 5.7(h), Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for certain
     Taxes imposed on Sellers as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

          (b) The Buyer shall prepare any and all documents, statements and
     other forms that are required to be submitted to any taxing authority in
     connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "Section 338 Forms")
     and deliver the same to the Sellers no later than 15 days prior to the date
     the Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Each of the Buyer, the
     Sellers and the Company shall cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly
     executed by an authorized person and shall return the same to the Buyer no
     later than 5 days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms are required to
     be filed, and the Buyer shall duly and timely file the same in accordance
     with the applicable tax laws.

          (c) The Buyer and the Sellers shall use their best efforts, as soon as
     practicable after the Closing Date, to enter into an agreement, as may be
     amended from time to time (the "Allocation Agreement"), to allocate the
     Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiary to the
     assets of the Company for tax purposes. The Buyer shall initially prepare a
     statement setting forth a proposed computation and allocation and shall
     submit the same to the Sellers along with copies of all workpapers,
     reports, opinions and other documents used to prepare the computation no
     later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. If, within thirty (30)
     days of the Sellers' receipt of the computation and

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

     the workpapers, the Sellers shall not have objected to such computation,
     the computation shall be the allocation. If the Sellers object in writing
     to the computation within thirty (30) days, the Buyer and the Sellers shall
     negotiate in good faith to resolve the computation. If the Buyer and the
     Sellers shall not have agreed to the computation and adopted an allocation
     within thirty (30) days after the Sellers' objection, any disputed aspects
     of the allocation shall be resolved by an accounting firm mutually
     acceptable to the Buyer and the Sellers (the "338 Auditors") as soon as
     practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to the
     earlier of (i) the last date on which the Section 338 Forms may be filed or
     (ii) the last date on which either the Buyer or the Seller (whichever is
     earlier) must file a Tax Return relating to the transactions contemplated
     hereby. The decision of the 338 Auditors shall be final, and the costs,
     expenses and fees of the 338 Auditors shall be born equally by the Buyer
     and the Sellers. The Buyer and the Sellers shall not take a position before
     any taxing authority or otherwise (including in any Tax Return)
     inconsistent with the allocations provided hereunder.

          (d) The Company and Sellers will not revoke the Company's election to
     be taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Code Sec. 1361 and 1362.
     The Company and Sellers will not take or allow any action that would result
     in the termination of the Company's status as a validly electing S
     corporation within the meaning of Code Sec. 1361 and 1362.

          (e) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
     be filed (on a timely basis) all income Tax Returns for the Company and the
     Subsidiary for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are
     filed after the Closing Date. Sellers shall prepare the Tax Returns in a
     manner consistent with the Tax Returns previously filed for the Company and
     Subsidiary and in accordance with applicable law, and Sellers shall
     indemnify Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary against any Taxes and
     penalties either (i) incurred by any of them related to the filing of such
     Tax Returns; or (ii) required to be reported on such Tax Returns. Sellers
     shall permit Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return described
     in the preceding sentence prior to filing. To the extent required by
     applicable law, Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or
     other tax items for such periods on their income Tax Returns in a manner
     consistent with the Schedule K-1's furnished to the Sellers for such
     periods. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
     be filed all non-income Tax Returns for the Company and Subsidiary for all
     periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the
     Closing Date. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of Company or
     Subsidiary with respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after
     payment by Buyer, the Company, or the Subsidiary of such Taxes to the
     extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability
     (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
     differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Balance
     Sheet, as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date (in
     accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and Subsidiary
     in filing Tax Returns) to reflect Tax liabilities incurred in the ordinary
     course of business after the date of the Balance Sheet.

          (f) Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiary and Sellers shall cooperate
     fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
     connection with the filing of Tax

                                      -36-

<PAGE>

     Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or other
     proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
     retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
     information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
     other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
     basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
     provided hereunder. The Company, the Subsidiary and Sellers agree (A) to
     retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
     Company and the Subsidiary relating to any taxable period beginning before
     the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
     to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
     respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
     entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party
     reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
     any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the Company
     and the Subsidiary or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other
     party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Sellers
     further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
     certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
     person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
     could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
     transactions contemplated hereby).

          (g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or
     other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
     in connection with this Agreement shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
     one-half by Sellers when due, and the party required by applicable law will
     file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
     such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
     Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the other parties will,
     and will cause their affiliates to, join in the execution of any such tax
     Returns and other documentation. The expense of such filings shall be paid
     one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers.

          (h) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for certain Taxes imposed on Sellers
     as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election as follows:

               (i) By no later than the sixtieth (60th) day prior to the due
          date (including one four (4)-month automatic extension) of the federal
          income Tax Returns of Sellers for each calendar year beginning with
          calendar year 2001 and ending with the last calendar year in which a
          payment to or from the Sellers is required under this Agreement,
          Sellers shall calculate and notify Buyer of an amount equal to the
          excess of (A) the total amount of federal and state income taxes
          payable by each Seller for all such years (including any increase or
          decrease in federal or state taxes payable as a result of any payment
          pursuant to this Section 5.7(h)), minus (B) the total amount of
          federal and state income taxes which would have been payable by each
          Seller for all such years if no Section 338(h)(10) Election had been
          made. The amount calculated pursuant to this Section 5.7(h) for each
          Seller is referred to herein as the "Section 338(h)(10) Amount" and
          shall be allocated to goodwill.

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

               (ii) Buyer, within fifteen (15) days following the date of each
          notice from Sellers of their calculation of Section 338(h)(10) Amounts
          pursuant to Section 5.7(h)(i), may object to such calculation by
          delivery of written notice to Sellers, setting forth in reasonable
          detail the nature of the objections. If Sellers and Buyer within ten
          (10) days following receipt by the Sellers of the written notice of
          objections are unable to resolve any disagreements regarding the
          calculation, all such disagreements at the written request of either
          Buyer or Sellers shall be referred for resolution to a
          mutually-agreed-upon neutral accounting firm (the "Neutral Accounting
          Firm"). In such event, the Neutral Accounting Firm shall as soon as
          reasonably practicable following the referral to it of the
          disagreements deliver to Sellers and Buyer a written report in which
          it shall set forth its determination of the Section 338(h)(10) Amounts
          for Sellers, and its determination shall be conclusive and binding on
          the parties hereto. Buyer and Sellers shall fully cooperate, and Buyer
          shall cause the Company to fully cooperate, with the Neutral
          Accounting Firm in connection with such determination hereunder,
          including without limitation providing the Neutral Accounting Firm
          with full access to his, her or its books and records to the extent
          relevant to such resolution. The costs and expenses of retaining the
          Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on the
          one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand (in proportion to their
          Shares). Within fifteen (15) days of each notice from Sellers to Buyer
          of the Section 338(h)(10) Amounts (or, if Buyer objects to such
          Notice, within fifteen (15) days after the final computation of the
          Section 338(h)(l0) Amounts), Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to
          make payments between them such that the net payment made from Buyer
          to Sellers (in the aggregate) under this Section 5.7(h) is equal to
          the lesser of (a) the aggregate total of the Section 338(h)(10)
          Amounts or (b) Two Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($280,000) plus
          fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the aggregate total of the
          Section 338(h)(10) amounts exceeds Two Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars
          ($280,000).

               (iii) At such time as a final and binding determination is made
          in any audit, review, examination or any other administrative or
          judicial proceeding (including any administrative or judicial review
          of any claim for refund) involving any Tax Return referred to in this
          Section 5.7(h) (a "Tax Contest"), the obligations of the parties under
          this Section 5.7(h) shall be adjusted (and payments shall be made
          between the parties to reflect such adjustments) in accordance with
          such final determination.

               (iv) Each of the parties shall provide prompt notice to the other
          party of any pending or threatened Tax Contest of which it becomes
          aware that could affect the obligations of either party under this
          Section 5.7(h). Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
          extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability or adjustment in
          reasonable detail (and its possible effect upon the obligations under
          this Section 5.7(h)) and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice
          and other documents received from any Tax authority in respect of any
          such matters. If a party that would be entitled to receive a payment
          under this Section 5.7(h) (an "Indemnified Party") has knowledge of an
          asserted Tax liability

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

         or adjustment that could affect the amount of such payment and such
         party fails to give the party that would be obligated to make such
         payment (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of such asserted Tax
         liability or adjustment, then (i) if the Indemnifying Party is
         precluded from contesting the asserted Tax liability or adjustment in
         any forum as a result of the failure to give prompt notice, the
         Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to make an additional
         payment to the Indemnified Party with respect to any Taxes arising out
         of such asserted Tax liability, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is
         not precluded from contesting the asserted Tax liability in any forum,
         but such failure to give prompt notice results in a monetary detriment
         to the Indemnifying Party, then any amount which the Indemnifying Party
         is otherwise required to pay the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
         Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

               (v) In the case of any Tax Contest, Sellers shall control the
          defense or prosecution of such Tax Contest; provided, however, Sellers
          shall not agree to or concede any Tax liability or adjustment that
          could cause Buyer to have an obligation under this Section 5.7(h)
          without Buyer's written consent, which consent shall not be
          unreasonably withheld. All costs and expenses of any such Tax Contest
          shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

          (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
     agreements and obligations under this Section 5.7 shall survive
     indefinitely.

          (j) Unless the Company is entitled to claim a compensation deduction
     (for a Tax Period other than the Company's final S Corporation Tax Return)
     for the payments made to the Option Holders under Section 1.2 above or
     under the Option Payout Agreements between the Company and the Option
     Holders, Sellers shall be liable to Buyer and the Company for any payroll
     Taxes incurred by Buyer or the Company as a result of any payment made to
     the Option Holders under Section 1.2 above or under the Option Payout
     Agreements between the Company and the Option Holders (including payroll
     Taxes incurred by the Company in its final S Corporation Tax year).

          Section 5.8 Continuing Involvement with Company.

          (a) After the Closing Date and for five (5) years thereafter, or such
     longer period thereafter as Buyer elects,

               (i) Buyer shall cause the Company's Board of Directors to be
          comprised of the following persons, subject to reasonable
          substitutions and changes (other than as to Miriam Meyer Allison and
          the CEO of the Company) as necessary in Buyer's reasonable discretion:

prior to the Closing Date). Thereafter, the parties shall apply to the Internal
Revenue Service for a favorable determination letter in connection with the
termination and liquidation of the 401(k) Plan. Upon the receipt of a favorable
Internal Revenue Service determination letter, the 401(k) Plan participants who
are employed by the Company may, in accordance with Section 401(a)(31) of the

          From the Closing Date to the end of the fifth Earn-Out Period, Buyer
will (a) use reasonable efforts to preserve the existence and corporate
structure of the Company and Subsidiary; (b) not, directly or indirectly, engage
in any business that is competitive with the business being conducted by the
Company or Subsidiary without the prior consent of the Company's Board; and (c)
not engage in any practice intended to minimize Sellers' ability to earn the

Buyer agrees that it will not terminate any of the Company's lines of business
existing on the Closing Date or terminate any customer of the Company existing
on the Closing Date without the prior approval of Ms. Allison, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as to contracts between Company or Subsidiary and Buyer or UMB,
Company and Subsidiary will accrue Gross Revenues for services provided at a
rate at least equal to their then-current standard fee schedules for
unaffiliated accounts. In addition, Buyer shall make available to the Sellers
copies of Buyer's internal management reports concerning Gross Revenues as Buyer
prepares or receives such reports in the ordinary course of its own business.

           SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION
           -----------------------------------------------------------

          Section 8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive for a
period of twenty-eight (28) months following the Closing; provided, however,
that the representations, warranties and covenants regarding tax and
environmental liabilities contained in Sections 3.9, 3.18 and 5.7 hereof shall
survive until expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation; and provided,
further, that if a Notice of Claim shall have been made before the expiration of
the applicable statutes of limitation, the representation to which such Notice
applies shall survive in respect of that claim until the final determination or
settlement of that claim.

          Section 8.2 Indemnification by Ms. Allison. Ms. Allison individually
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and representatives from and against all
liabilities, losses, claims, costs or damages whatsoever (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), arising out of, from or based on:

          (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained herein

     obligation to be performed by any such party under this Agreement.

<PAGE>

          Section 8.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Sellers from and against all liabilities, losses,
claims, costs or damages whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising out of, from or based on:

          (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained herein
     made by Buyer; or

          (b) the non-performance by Buyer of any covenant, agreement or
     obligation to be performed by Buyer hereunder.

          Section 8.4 Reimbursement.

          (a) After a claim has been approved or deemed approved by Ms. Allison
     pursuant to Section 8.5(b) and subject to the right of Ms. Allison to
     assume control and defense of any such claim pursuant to Section 8.5(c),
     Ms. Allison individually agrees to reimburse Buyer within twenty (20) days
     after receipt of Buyer's written request for payment with respect to any
     loss, damage, cost or expense suffered by Buyer at any time after the date
     hereof in accordance with Section 8.2 above.

          (b) After a claim has been approved or deemed approved by Buyer
     pursuant to Section 8.5(b) and subject to the right of the Buyer to assume
     control and defense of any such claim pursuant to Section 8.5(c), Buyer
     agrees to reimburse the Sellers within twenty (20) days after receipt of
     Buyer's written request for payment with respect to any loss, damage, cost
     or expense suffered by Sellers at any time after the date hereof in
     accordance with Section 8.3 above.

          Section 8.5 Indemnification Procedures.

          (a) When a claim is made by any person not a party to this Agreement
     with respect to any matter that relates to the indemnification provisions
     of this Article 8, the indemnified party (the "Indemnitee") shall notify
     the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor") in writing within ten (10) days
     after the Indemnitee has written notice of the facts constituting the basis
     for such claim (the "Notice of Claim"). Whenever any claim is made by one
     of the parties to this Agreement with respect to any matter to which the
     indemnification provisions of this Article 8 relate, the Indemnitee shall
     send a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor as soon as practicable. The Notice
     of Claim shall specify all facts known to Indemnitee relating to such
     indemnification claim and the amount or an estimate of the amount of the
     liability arising from such claim. The Notice of Claim shall be given in
     accordance with Section 10.5 of this Agreement.

          (b) Each claim will be deemed approved by the Indemnitor, unless the
     Indemnitor gives the Indemnitee written notice of disapproval within twenty
     (20) days of receipt of such Notice of Claim. The parties shall undertake,
     in good faith, to resolve any dispute with respect to any such claim that
     is so disapproved. If such good faith discussions do not lead to a
     resolution of the controversy or dispute, then the parties shall meet with
     a mutually acceptable mediator to further attempt to resolve such
     controversy or dispute.

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

          (c) If the facts giving rise to any such indemnification shall involve
     any actual, threatened or possible claim or demand by any person against
     the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to defend such claim at
     its expense and through counsel of its own choosing if it gives written
     notice of its intention to assume the defense of such claim to Indemnitee
     within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Notice of Claim. If the
     Indemnitor shall exercise such option, it shall have control over such
     defense and over the payment, settlement or compromise of such claim, and
     the Indemnitee agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its
     attorneys with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor shall not exercise
     such option, the Indemnitee may, but shall not be obligated to, assume the
     contest and defense of such claim. Any payment or settlement resulting from
     such contest, together with the total expenses thereof, including but not
     limited to attorneys' fees, shall be binding upon the Indemnitor and
     Indemnitee.

          (d) After the Closing, and except with respect to obligations under
     Section 5.7 above, the indemnification provided for by this Article 8 shall
     constitute the exclusive remedy of either party with respect to (i) the
     matters for which indemnification is provided, and (ii) any other matters
     arising out of, relating to or in conjunction with this Agreement or the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          Section 8.6 Limitations of Indemnification. No Indemnitee shall assert
any claim for indemnification against any Indemnitor until such time as the
aggregate of all claims which the Indemnitee shall have against the Indemnitor
shall equal One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) (the "Basket Amount"),
and then only for the amounts in excess of the Basket Amount. In no event shall
the indemnification obligations hereunder of an Indemnitor exceed Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000.00). The provisions of this Section
8.6 shall not apply to (i) any claim based on a representation, warranty or
covenant made in Section 3.9 above, (ii) any obligation under Section 5.7 above,
or (iii) any obligations of the Buyer to make any payments pursuant to Section
1.2 hereof, subject to the provisions of Section 8.7 hereof.. Notwithstanding
any term contained herein to the contrary, the provisions of Section 8.6 shall
not apply to any claim based on a representation, warranty or covenant made in
Section 4.4 (ii) and (iii).

          Section 8.7 Offsets. The Buyer shall have the right to offset against
any and all amounts paid to any and all Sellers pursuant to Section 1.2(c) of
this Agreement to the extent that moneys are owed at any time by Sellers to
Buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII. The
Sellers agree that such right of offset shall be in addition to the rights of
Buyer to make claims under this Article VIII.

          Section 8.8 Determination of Amount of Claim. In determining the
amount of any claim under this Article VIII, such amount shall be net of
insurance proceeds actually received. In addition, with respect to all claims by
Buyer for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, Buyer shall, in good
faith, first determine whether insurance coverage exists with respect to such
claims, and if such coverage exists, Buyer shall timely and diligently pursue
such coverage and shall apply the proceeds thereof to all such claims prior to
seeking indemnification under Section 8.2 hereof.

Agreement is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions
hereof which can be given effect without the invalid provisions, and, to this
end, the provisions of this Agreement are intended and shall be deemed
severable. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties
hereby waive any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement
prohibited or unenforceable in any way, and any prohibited or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement shall be considered to have been superseded by a
legally permissible and enforceable clause which corresponds most closely to the
intent of the parties as evidenced by the provisions held to be unenforceable.

          Section 10.9 Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy at law or in equity.

          Section 10.10 Definition of Sellers' Knowledge. "Sellers' knowledge"
shall mean, where a representation or warranty is stated to, or based on, the
knowledge of the Sellers, the matter is actually known by Sellers or should have
been known by Sellers in their capacities as stockholders and by Ms. Allison in
her capacity as an executive officer of the Company.
