<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waddell&nbsp;&amp;
Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") previously established the Waddell&nbsp;&amp; Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc. 1998 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to Section&nbsp;8 of the Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to amend the Plan. Pursuant to the powers reserved in the
Plan, the Plan is hereby amended effective December&nbsp;12, 2002 (the "Effective Date"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan shall be renamed the "Waddell&nbsp;&amp; Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc. 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Award Plan" and all references in the Plan to the
"Waddell&nbsp;&amp; Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc. 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan" are hereby amended to read the "Waddell&nbsp;&amp; Reed Financial,&nbsp;Inc.
Non-Employee Director Stock Award Plan." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following definitions are hereby added to Section&nbsp;2.1 of the Plan to read as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Award"
means the grant of an Option or Restricted Stock to an Awardee pursuant to the terms, conditions and limitations that the Committee may establish in order to fulfill the
objectives of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awardee"
means a Non-Employee Director to whom an outstanding Award has been granted or, in the event of such Non-Employee Director's death prior to the
expiration of an Option or the lapse of restrictions encumbering Restricted Stock, such Non-Employee Director's Beneficiary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Award
Notice" means a written award notice to a Non-Employee Director from the Company evidencing an Option or a Restricted Stock Award, as applicable. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Restricted
Stock" means Shares granted to a Participant under Article&nbsp;6 hereof, that is subject to certain restrictions and/or to a risk of forfeiture. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as provided in this Second Amendment, the occurrences within the Plan of the defined term "Option" or "Options" shall be replaced with the defined term "Award" or "Awards," the
occurrences within the Plan of the defined term "Stock Option Award Notice" shall be replaced with the defined term "Award Notice," and the occurrences within the Plan of the defined term "Optionee"
shall be replaced with the defined term "Awardee;" provided, however, that the definitions of "Option" and "Optionee" in Section&nbsp;2.1 of the Plan shall remain unchanged. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;6
of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as follows: </FONT></P>

only one time, during the calendar year immediately
following the filing of a Primary Election Form under Article&nbsp;5, a Participant shall have the right to convert into an Award pursuant to this Article&nbsp;6 the then-current
balance (as of the date of such election to receive an Award) in his or her Interest Account for the calendar year to which the Primary Election Form relates. For example, if a Primary Election Form
is filed in December&nbsp;1998 to defer Annual Compensation to be earned in 1999, the director may elect at any time in 1999 to convert such deferred amount to an Award. To make such election, the
Participant must file with the Plan Administrator a written irrevocable Secondary Election Form to receive an Award as of the date of the election (the "Award Grant Date"). </FONT></P>

the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, in cash, by check or such other instrument as may be acceptable to the Committee (including instruments
providing for "cashless exercise"). Payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of unrestricted Shares already owned by the Optionee (based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the
Shares on the date the Option is exercised, as determined by the Committee). If payment of the exercise price of an Option is made in whole or in part in the form of Shares that are restricted, the
Shares received upon the exercise of such Option shall be restricted in accordance with the original term of the restricted stock award in question, except that such restrictions shall apply to only
the number of Shares equal to the number of restricted stock surrendered upon the exercise of such Option. No Shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An Optionee shall have
rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to the Option when the Optionee has given written notice of exercise and has paid in full for such Shares. </FONT></P>

without limitation, that, if payment on exercise of an Option is made in the form of Shares, and the exercise occurs on the Annual SORP Exercise Date, an additional Option ("SORP Option") will

term equal to that of the original option period for the exercised Option giving rise to the grant of the SORP option, not to exceed a maximum term of 10&nbsp;years and two days from such date of
exercise (subject to any forfeiture provision or shorter limitation on exercise required under the Plan), having an initial exercise date no earlier than six months after the date of such exercise,
and covering a number of shares equal to the number of Shares used to pay the exercise price of the Stock Option, plus the number of shares (if any) withheld to cover income taxes and employment taxes
(plus any selling commissions) on the exercise. "Annual SORP Exercise Date" shall mean August&nbsp;1, or if August&nbsp;1 is not a trading day on the New York Stock Exchange, "Annual SORP Exercise
Date" shall mean the next succeeding trading date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may delay the Annual SORP Exercise Date to the extent it determines necessary to comply with regulatory

transfers of an Award where the Committee concludes that such transferability (a)&nbsp;does not result in accelerated taxation, and (b)&nbsp;is otherwise appropriate and desirable, taking into
