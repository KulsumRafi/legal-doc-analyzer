Company of America (&#147;Prudential Insurance&#148;), effective as of July 1, 1974, for the purpose of providing a method of deferring payment to non-employee directors of the Company (the &#147;Non-Employee Directors&#148;) of their fees, as fixed
from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company until termination of their services on the Board. The Plan was amended and restated effective as of May 12, 1998. Effective as of January 1, 2002, the Plan was amended to transfer
sponsorship from Prudential Insurance to Prudential Financial, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) to reflect the change in corporate structure resulting from the demutualization of Prudential Insurance, and the establishment of the Company as the
publicly-held parent company of Prudential Insurance as of December 17, 2001. Effective as of September 10, 2002, the Plan has been amended and restated, with such changes generally to be effective as of January 1, 2003 as set forth herein, to
provide for the deferral of &#147;Stock Based Fees&#148; and &#147;Cash Based Fees&#148; (as defined below), the provision of certain additional notional investment options under the Plan related to the deferral of such Fees, and to address the
suspension of, and &#147;rollover&#148; of accrued amounts under, the Pension Plan (as defined below). </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P
