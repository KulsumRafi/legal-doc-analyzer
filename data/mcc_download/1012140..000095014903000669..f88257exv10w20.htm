hereunder. The correspondence and other material documenting such agreement
are collectively referred to herein as the &#147;Research Plan.&#148; Each party agrees
to use its best efforts to perform the activities detailed in the Research
Plan, in a professional and timely manner. Onyx agrees to use its best efforts
at its cost &#091;*&#093; to (i)&nbsp;develop and transfer to Warner &#091;*&#093; screening assays &#091;*&#093;
of the Term of the Research Collaboration for specific targets in the Field
selected by the Research Management Committee, (ii)&nbsp;supply protein required to
run such screens and (iii)&nbsp;provide for the testing of substantially all of
Onyx&#146;s compound library in such screens. Onyx shall not knowingly provide or
perform research on any compounds the use of which would require a royalty or
other payment to any third party, unless the Research Management Committee
agrees that such compound should be provided and the parties agree in writing
how such royalty or other payment will be paid. Warner agrees to use its best
efforts at its cost (including the cost of any royalties or other amounts
payable by Warner to third parties) to (i)&nbsp;screen substantially all of its
compound library with such screens provided by Onyx and (ii)&nbsp;conduct medicinal
chemistry and animal pharmacology as the Research Management Committee deems
appropriate. Promptly after the Effective Date, Onyx and Warner will disclose
to each other all information possessed by it relevant to the Field and
necessary or helpful to perform the work described in the Research Plan (except
to the extent precluded by the pre-existing confidentiality obligations
described on Schedule&nbsp;1 hereto). During the Term of the Research
Collaboration, or one year thereafter, the Research Management Committee and
either party individually may from time to time declare any compound that meets
the definition therefor in Article&nbsp;1 to be a Collaboration Compound.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party will be required to offer the
other party any compounds or information relating to compounds that have been
identified as candidates for cGLP/cGMP studies on or before the Effective Date,
or are hereafter so identified without material application of information
provided by the other party or developed pursuant to the Collaboration.
Neither party shall be required to screen under this Collaboration or to offer
to the other party any information regarding any compounds identified as having
activity in pathways expressly excluded from the Field, if so identified prior
to being designated a &#147;Collaboration Compound&#148; hereunder.

both parties will be determined by the Research Management Committee. Such
staff will include, as appropriate, scientists in the areas of mass screening,
molecular biology, biochemistry, biochemical pharmacology, cancer and

such party&#146;s Know-How and Patents that are conceived or reduced to practice

granting party may terminate such licenses granted by it immediately upon its

neither party is granted any interest in the other&#146;s compounds (or analogs or

other party a copy of the information to be disclosed, and shall allow the
other party &#091;*&#093; from the date of receipt in which to determine whether the
information to be disclosed contains subject matter for which patent protection
should be sought prior to disclosure. If notification is not received during
the &#091;*&#093; period, the party proposing disclosure shall be free to proceed with
the disclosure. If due to a valid business reason or a belief by the
nondisclosing party that the disclosure contains subject matter for which a
patentable invention should be sought, then prior to the expiration of the &#091;*&#093;
period, the nondisclosing party shall so notify the disclosing party, who shall
then delay public disclosure of the information for an additional period of up
to &#091;*&#093; to permit the preparation and filing of a patent application on the
subject matter to be disclosed or other action to be taken. The party
proposing disclosure shall thereafter be free to publish or disclose the
information. The determination of authorship for any paper shall be in
accordance with accepted scientific practice. In no event may any publication
or other
disclosure contain a party&#146;s Confidential Information without such party&#146;s
prior written consent.

entity for use in Japan, except pursuant to an agreement mutually acceptable to
Onyx and Warner (the &#147;Japanese Company Agreement&#148;). Onyx and Warner will work

Company&#148;) and to hold negotiations with the Japanese Company regarding the
terms of the Japanese Company Agreement.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11<B>.</B>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Japanese Company Agreement</B>. Warner agrees that it will accept any

(i) &#091;*&#093; provided, however, that &#091;*&#093; (ii) &#091;*&#093; (iii) &#091;*&#093; (iv) &#091;*&#093; (v) &#091;*&#093; (vi)

identified by the Japanese Company as a candidate for cGLP/cGMP studies before
the effective date of the Japanese Company Agreement, or analogs or derivatives
thereof not identified pursuant to any collaboration between Onyx and the
Japanese Company or (b)&nbsp;any compound identified after the &#091;*&#093; anniversary of
the term of the research collaboration under such agreement; and further
provided that this provision will apply to compounds identified during the term
of the research collaboration under such agreement or &#091;*&#093; thereafter, and any
derivatives or analogs of such compounds whenever identified, and (vii) &#091;*&#093;
For purposes of clause (i)&nbsp;of this section, any dispute about the &#091;*&#093; that
cannot be resolved by good faith negotiations between senior executive officers
of Onyx and Warner will be resolved by the decision of an investment bank
familiar with valuations of privately-held biotechnology companies selected by
the parties in good faith agreement, with the cost of performing such valuation
borne equally by the parties.

hold harmless the other party and its Affiliates and their respective
employees, agents, officers, directors and permitted assigns (such party&#146;s
&#147;Indemnified Group&#148;) from and against any claims, judgments, expenses
(including reasonable attorney&#146;s fees), damages and awards (collectively a
&#147;Claim&#148;) arising out of or resulting from (i)&nbsp;its negligence or misconduct in
regard to any Product, (ii)&nbsp;a breach of any of its representations or warranties hereunder or
(iii)&nbsp;the manufacture, use or sale of a Collaboration Product (in the case of
Warner) or an Onyx Product (in the case of Onyx), except to the extent that

misconduct of a member of such party&#146;s Indemnified Group. A condition of this
obligation is that, whenever an indemnified party has information from which it
may reasonably conclude an incident has occurred which could give rise to a

is made or suit is brought, all indemnified parties shall assist the
indemnifying party and cooperate in the gathering of information with respect
