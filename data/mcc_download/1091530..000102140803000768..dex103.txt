                      AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

          This Amendment (this "Amendment") to that certain Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by and among XM
SATELLITE RADIO INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), XM SATELLITE RADIO
HOLDINGS INC., a Delaware corporation and the sole stockholder of the Company
("Holdings" and, together with the Company, the "Obligors"), and each of the
investors identified on the signature pages hereto (the "Consenting Investors"
and, together with the Obligors, each, individually, a "Party" and,
collectively, the "Parties") is made as of January 16, 2003. Capitalized terms
used herein but not defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Agreement.

                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, the Obligors and the Investors, including the Consenting
Investors, have entered into the Agreement pursuant to which the Obligors have
agreed to issue and sell, and the Investors have agreed to purchase, an
aggregate of $185,000,000 in Initial Value of Notes;

          WHEREAS, following execution of the definitive documentation for the
placement of the Notes to the Investors, the Obligors desire to raise additional
funds to further improve their liquidity position through the issuance and sale
of securities and to that end have approached the Investors for their consent in
permitting the Obligors to issue and sell additional Notes of the same series to
the Investors or other Persons;

          WHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend the terms of the Agreement in order
to permit the Obligors to issue and sell at the Closing up to an additional
$25,000,000 in Initial Value of Notes; and

          WHEREAS, the Consenting Investors constitute Majority Holders and, as
such, are permitted and authorized to enter into this Amendment on behalf of the
Investors.

                                    AGREEMENT

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
representations contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, and
intending to be bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

          1.   AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT.

          The following provisions of the Agreement shall be amended as set
forth below:

          (a)  Each of the title page and Section 2(a) of the Agreement shall be
amended to delete the reference to "$366,300,000" therein and to substitute
"$415,800,000" therefor.

<PAGE>

          (b)  The term "Investors" shall be amended for all purposes of the
Agreement to mean (i) the Investors as defined for purposes of the Agreement as
initially executed and (ii) each other Person that enters into a joinder
agreement in the form of Exhibit A hereto (each a "Joinder Agreement").

          (c)  Attachment 1 to the Agreement shall be amended from time to time
as contemplated by Section 2(b) below.

          (d)  Appropriate revisions shall be made to each of the forms attached
as exhibits to the Agreement prior to execution in order to reflect the issuance
and sale of up to an aggregate of $25,000,000 in Initial Value of Notes to those
Persons that enter into a Joinder Agreement.

          2.   ADDITIONAL INVESTORS

          (a)  The Company may, in its discretion, enter into one or more
Joinder Agreements from time to time after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing. It is the intention of the Parties, that, upon execution of a Joinder
Agreement with each of the Obligors, a Person shall become obligated with
respect to the purchase of the Initial Value of Notes set forth in such Joinder
Agreement to the same extent, and otherwise on the same terms, as if such Person
were an Investor that had executed and delivered the Agreement as initially
executed. Without limiting the foregoing, such Person shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement (as amended hereby or from time to time
hereafter), severally agree to purchase for cash from the Obligors at the
Closing, and the Obligors shall agree to sell and issue to such Person at the
Closing, a Note with a principal amount at maturity equal to the Accreted Value
as of December 31, 2005 of a Note with an Initial Value set forth in such
Person's Joinder Agreement.

          (b)  In connection with their execution and delivery of a Joinder
Agreement with any Person, the Obligors shall make appropriate revisions to
Attachment 1 to the Agreement (as then in effect) and such revised Attachment 1
shall thereafter constitute "Attachment 1" for all purposes of the Agreement (as
then amended). Promptly after executing and delivering any Joinder Agreement,
the Obligors shall provide each Investor with a copy of such Joinder Agreement,
together with a copy of Attachment 1 to the Agreement as then in effect, in
accordance with Section 17 of the Agreement (as then amended).

          (c)  Notwithstanding Section 2(a) hereof or any provision of the
Agreement, the obligations of the Obligors to issue and sell Notes to any Person
pursuant to a Joinder Agreement, and the obligations of any such Person to
purchase such Notes under such Joinder Agreement, shall be subject to (i) the
receipt by the Obligors, at or prior to the Closing, of all consents required
with respect thereto under any of the Transaction Documents, and (ii) applicable
law and regulation.

                                        2

          3.   MISCELLANEOUS

documents, agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Amendment.

          (b)  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which, when taken
together, shall constitute an original.

                                    * * * * *
