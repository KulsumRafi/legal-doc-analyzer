     WHEREAS, the Lenders have extended certain credit facilities to the Company
and the Canadian Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement;

     WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement and as described herein,
Forbearance Defaults (as defined below) have occurred and/or may occur under the
Credit Agreement and the Borrowers have requested that the Administrative Agent,
the Canadian Administrative Agent and the Lenders forbear from exercising
certain remedies against the Loan Parties as a result of the Forbearance
Defaults;

     WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to forbear from exercising formal
remedies, including acceleration of amounts owed under the Credit Agreement, as
a result of the Forbearance Defaults, for the period and on the terms set forth

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the agreements and

     the Loan Documents), arising solely as a result of the Forbearance
     Defaults. The Lenders agree to waive the Forbearance Defaults to the extent
     necessary to permit the Borrowers to borrow and request Loans and Letters
     of Credit in accordance with Section 6 below unless and until the

                                                           Forbearance Agreement

                                                                               2


     result of the failure of the Company to comply with (a) Section 7.1 of the

     quarters ending on, March 31, 2003 and June 30, 2003, (b) Section 6.1(a) of
     the Credit Agreement solely as a result of the failure of the Company to

     Party or its Subsidiaries (other than under the Credit Agreement) are
     exercising or attempting to exercise any remedies (including accelerating
     payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes) against any Loan Party or a
     Subsidiary or any property of any of them, (b) any Loan Party or any of its
     Subsidiaries grants or suffers any Liens arising or created after the date
     hereof (other than Liens created to secure obligations under the Loan
     Documents and Liens created under Section 7.3(a), (b) and (e) of the Credit
     Agreement), (c) without limitation of clause (ii) above, any Loan Party or

     as in effect on the date hereof and payments in the ordinary course of

     equity of the Company or of a direct holding company of the Company (as
     determined by the Company and the Lenders) and (ii) to commence
     solicitation of holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes for the Senior
     Subordinated

                                                           Forbearance Agreement

                                                                               3


     Notes Conversion, in each case under this clause (e) by June 30, 2003, or

     prospects of either Borrower has occurred from the date hereof other than

     payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes (provided that a failure by the
     Lenders to act with respect to any of the events described in the preceding
     clauses (a)-(f) shall not preclude the Lenders from acting with respect to
     any such events at a later time or any subsequent or similar events) and

     (other than the Forbearance Defaults described in Section 1 above) or this
     Agreement. As used herein "Forbearance Period" means the period from the
     date hereof to the termination of the forbearance pursuant to this Section
     3.

4.   On the Forbearance Effective Date (as defined below) the Total Commitments
     will be automatically reduced from $85,000,000 to $70,000,000. The

5.   The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, (i) for the account
     of each Lender which has returned an executed counterpart of this Agreement
     to the Administrative Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on March 25,
     2003, a forbearance fee equal to .50% of the Commitment of such Lender

     Administrative Agent after 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on March 25, 2003 but
     prior to 5.00 p.m. (New York time) on March 28, 2003, a forbearance fee
     equal to .25% of the Commitment of such Lender (calculated after giving

     lesser of (i) $60,000,000 and (ii) for any day 115% of the projected usage
     of the Facilities for such day as set forth in the Credit Agreement

     of New York. This Agreement is to be narrowly construed and does not
     constitute a waiver of any Event of Default. The provisions of Section 10
     (including, without limitation, Section 10.9) of the Credit Agreement are
     incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis. This Agreement is a Loan Document.

13.  This Agreement shall be limited precisely as written and shall not be
     deemed (a) to be a consent granted pursuant to, or a waiver or modification
     of, any other term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
     Document or a waiver of any Default or Event of Default under the Credit
     Agreement, whether or not known to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian
     Administrative Agent or the Lenders, except as expressly provided herein or
     (b) to prejudice any right or rights which the Administrative Agent, the
     Canadian Administrative Agent or the Lenders may now have or have in the
     future under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the
     instruments or agreements referred to in any Loan Document. Each of the

     itself and the Lenders) hereby expressly reserves all of the Administrative
     Agent's, the Canadian Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' (as
     applicable) respective rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement and
     each of the other Loan Documents, as well as under applicable law. No
     failure to exercise, delay in exercising or any singular or partial
     exercise, by the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or
     any of the Lenders, of any right, power or remedy hereunder or any of the
     other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any of
     the Loan Documents be construed as a standstill or a forbearance by any of
     the Agents or the Lenders of their rights and remedies thereunder except as
     expressly provided herein. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been
     jointly drafted, and no provision of it shall be interpreted or construed
     for or against any party hereto because such party purportedly prepared or
     requested such provision, any other provision, or this Agreement as a
     whole.

14.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
     different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
     executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
     taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery
     of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
     effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
