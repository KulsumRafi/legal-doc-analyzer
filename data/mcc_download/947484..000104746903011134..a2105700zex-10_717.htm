which each outstanding Share shall be changed or for which each such Share

respect of which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment, in a
manner acceptable to the Company (which shall include a broker assisted
exercise arrangement), of the Option Price for the Option Shares for which the
Option is being exercised.&#160; Payment to
the Company in cash or Shares already owned by the Option Holder (provided that
the Option Holder has owned such Shares for a minimum period of six months or
has purchased such Shares on the open market) and having a total Fair Market
Value (as defined below) equal to the exercise price, or in a combination of
cash and such Shares, shall be deemed acceptable for purposes hereof.&#160; Option Shares will be issued accordingly by the

or mental illness) or failure, neglect or refusal by the Option Holder to perform
his or her duties and responsibilities without the same being corrected within
ten (10) days after being given written notice thereof; (e) continued and
habitual use of alcohol by the Option Holder to an extent which materially
impairs the Option Holder&#146;s performance of his or her duties without the same
being corrected within ten (10) days after being given written notice thereof;

Permanent Disability shall be determined by a qualified, independent physician
selected by the Company and approved by the Option Holder (which approval shall
