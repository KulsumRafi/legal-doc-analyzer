                      SECOND LIMITED FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT

     THIS SECOND LIMITED FORBEARANCE  AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of
the  28th day of  February,  2003,  by and  among  DANZER  INDUSTRIES,  INC.,  a

"Borrower");  OBSIDIAN  ENTERPRISES,  INC., a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of the State of New York (the  "Guarantor";  the Borrower and the
Guarantor are sometimes  herein  collectively  referred to as the "Obligors" and
individually  as an "Obligor");  and BANK OF AMERICA,  N.A., a national  banking
association (the "Lender").

                                    RECITALS

     A. The Borrower  applied to the Lender for  revolving  loans,  advances and
other financial  accommodations  under the provisions of a certain Business Loan
Agreement  (Asset  Based)  dated August 15, 2001 by and between the Borrower and
the Lender (as amended, restated, supplemented and modified at any time and from
time to time, the "Financing Agreement"). Under and subject to the provisions of
the  Financing  Agreement,  the Lender agreed to make loans  (collectively,  the
"Revolving  Credit Loans" and each  individually,  a "Revolving Credit Loan") to
the  Borrower  under a revolving  credit  facility in a principal  amount not to
exceed, in the aggregate, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). The Revolving Credit
Loans are evidenced by, and repaid with interest in accordance  with,  the terms
and conditions of that certain  Promissory  Note dated August 15, 2001, from the
Borrower,  as maker, payable to the order of the Lender in the maximum principal
amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (as amended,  restated,  supplemented
and modified at any time and from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Note").

     B. The  Borrower  applied  to the  Lender  for a term loan in the  original
principal  amount of One Million  Dollars  ($1,000,000)  (the "Term  Loan";  the
aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Loans  and the  Term  Loan  are  herein  sometimes
collectively  referred to as the  "Loans").  The Term Loan is evidenced  by, and
repaid with interest in accordance  with,  the terms and conditions of a certain
Promissory  Note dated August 15, 2001 from the Borrower,  as maker,  payable to
the order of the Lender in the  original  principal  amount of the Term Loan (as
amended, restated,  supplemented and modified at any time and from time to time,
the "Term  Note";  the  Revolving  Credit  Note and the Term Note are  sometimes
herein sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes").

     C. The "Indebtedness" (as defined in the Financing  Agreement),  including,
without  limitation,  the  Loans,  is secured  by,  among  other  things (i) the
"Collateral",  as defined in a certain Security  Agreement dated August 15, 2001
executed by the Borrower  for the benefit of the Lender (as  amended,  restated,
supplemented  and  modified  at any time and from  time to time,  the  "Security
Agreement"),  (ii)  the  "Property"  as  defined  in a  certain  Deed of  Trust,
Assignment  and Security  Agreement  recorded in the land records of  Washington
County,  Maryland,  dated  August 15, 2001  executed by the Borrower in favor of
PRLAP,  Inc., as trustee,  for the benefit of the Lender (as amended,  restated,
supplemented  and  modified  at any  time and from  time to time,  the  "Deed of
Trust")  (iii) a certain  Commercial  Guaranty  dated  August 15,  2001 from the
Guarantor to the Lender (as amended, restated,  supplemented and modified at any
time and from time to time, the "Guaranty") and (iv) various Uniform  Commercial
Code  Financing   Statements   filed  with  the  Maryland  State  Department  of
Assessments and Taxation and in the land records of Washington County,  Maryland
listing the Borrower as debtor.
<PAGE>

     D. The Lender has  previously  advised  each of the  Obligors  of  material
defaults under the Financing  Agreement,  the Guaranty,  the Loans and the other
Financing  Agreements (as hereinafter  defined) and the Borrower,  the Guarantor
and the Lender entered into a Limited  Forbearance  Agreement  dated October 14,
2002 (as amended, restated,  supplemented and modified at any time and from time
to time, the "First Forbearance  Agreement") whereby the Lender agreed,  subject
to the terms,  conditions and understandings  expressed in the First Forbearance
Agreement,  to refrain and forbear temporarily from exercising and enforcing any
of its  remedies  against  either or both of the  Obligors  with  respect to the
Indebtedness  relating to the Loans,  under the  Financing  Documents,  or under
applicable  laws for a period  commencing  on the date of the First  Forbearance
Agreement  and ending on, and  including the  Forbearance  Termination  Date (as
defined in the First  Forbearance  Agreement) in order to allow the Obligors the
opportunity to obtain alternate financing.

     E.  The  Lender  has  subsequently  advised  each  of the  Obligors  of the
following  material defaults under the Financing  Agreement,  the Guaranty,  the
Loans, the First Forbearance  Agreement and the other Financing  Documents:  (a)
the  Borrower's  failure to  maintain a Debt to Worth  Ratio (as  defined in the
Financing  Agreement)  not  exceeding  3.25:1.0  as required by the terms of the
Financing  Agreement (the "Debt to Worth Ratio Covenant") for: (i) the period of
determination  ending on and  including  October 31, 2002 and (ii) the period of
determination  ending on and including  January 31, 2003; and (b) the Borrower's
failure to furnish Lender with the Borrower's balance sheet and income statement
for the Borrower's  fiscal year 2002,  audited by a certified public  accountant
satisfactory to the Lender (the "Annual  Statements") within the ninety (90) day
time period tolling from the end of the  Borrower's  fiscal year, as required by
the  Financing  Agreement  ((a)  and (b)  above,  together  with  their  various
subparts, collectively referred to herein as the "Existing Defaults").

         E. The Lender has agreed, subject to the terms, conditions and
understandings expressed in this Agreement, to refrain and forbear temporarily
from exercising and enforcing any of its remedies against any or all of the
Obligors with respect to the Indebtedness relating to the Loans, under the
Financing Agreement, the Notes, the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty, under any of
the other "Related Documents" (as defined in the Financing Agreement) and/or the
First Forbearance Agreement (the Financing Agreement, the Notes, the Security
Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty, the Related Documents, the First
Forbearance Agreement and any and all other documents evidencing or securing the
Loans are collectively referred to herein as the "Financing Documents"), or
under applicable laws for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
ending on, and including, the earlier of the date of a "Forbearance Default"
under the terms of this Agreement (as hereinafter defined) or March 31, 2003
(such earlier date being referred to herein as the "Forbearance Termination
Date") in order to allow the Obligors the opportunity to obtain alternate
financing; provided that, among other things, the Obligors execute and deliver
this Agreement.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the premises and for other good and
valuable  consideration,   the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is  hereby
acknowledged, the Lender and the Obligors hereby agree as follows:

and, no such understanding,  representation,  warranty or recital fails or omits
to state or otherwise  disclose any material  fact or  information  necessary to
prevent  such  understanding,  representation,  warranty  or recital  from being
misleading.  The Obligors acknowledge and agree that the Lender has been induced
in part to  enter  into  this  Agreement  based  upon the  Lender's  justifiable
reliance  on the  truth,  accuracy,  and  completeness  of  all  understandings,
representations,  warranties and recitals contained in this Agreement, the First
Forbearance  Agreement,  the Financing Agreement,  the Notes, the Deed of Trust,
the Guaranty and the other  Financing  Documents.  The recitals are deemed to be
part of this Agreement. There is no fact known to any Obligor or which should be
known to any Obligor  which the  Obligors  have not  disclosed  to the Lender in
writing  on or  prior  to the  date of  this  Agreement  which  would  or  could
materially and adversely  affect the  understandings  of the Lender expressed in
this  Agreement  or any  representation,  warranty or recital  contained in this
Agreement,  the First Forbearance Agreement, the Financing Agreement, the Notes,
the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty and the other Financing Documents.  The Obligors

shall  not  cause  a  novation  with  respect  to any or all of the  obligations
contained  in the  Financing  Agreement,  the  Notes,  the  Deed of  Trust,  the
Guaranty, the First Forbearance Agreement and/or the other Financing Documents.
<PAGE>

     (f) Each of the Financing Documents  (including,  without  limitation,  the
First Forbearance  Agreement) continues in full force and effect notwithstanding
the  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement.  Each of the  Obligors  hereby
reissues, ratifies and confirms the enforceability and validity of all Financing
Documents to which it is a party and agree that this  Agreement  and each of the
Financing Documents  constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each
of the  Obligors to the extent such  Obligor is party  thereto,  enforceable  in
accordance  with  their  respective  terms.  In  addition,   the  Obligors  each
acknowledge  and agree that neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor any of the terms,  provisions,  covenants  or  agreements  contained in this
Agreement  shall  in any  manner  release,  impair,  lessen,  modify,  waive  or
otherwise  affect the liability and  obligations of the Obligors under the terms
of the Financing Documents (including, without limitation, the First Forbearance
Agreement).  The Obligors  acknowledge  and confirm the Lender's duly  perfected
first priority  security interest to and against the Collateral and the Lender's
rights and first priority  security  interest as to the Property pursuant to the
Deed of Trust,  the  Security  Agreement,  the  other  Financing  Documents  and
financing statements.

     (g) The  Lender  has  acted in good  faith  and has  conducted  itself in a
commercially reasonable manner in its relationships with each of the Obligors in
connection  with  this  Agreement  and  in  connection   with  the  Loans,   the
Indebtedness and the Financing Documents  (including,  without  limitation,  the
First Forbearance Agreement), the Obligors each hereby waiving and releasing any
claims to the contrary. The Obligors have no defenses, affirmative or otherwise,
rights of setoff, rights of recoupment, claims, counterclaims, actions or causes
of action  of any kind or  nature  whatsoever  against  the  Lender or any past,
present  or  future  agent,  attorney,  legal  representative,   predecessor  in
interest,  affiliate,  successor,  assign, employee,  director or officer of the
Lender (collectively,  the "Lender Group"), directly or indirectly,  arising out
of,  based  upon,  or in any manner  connected  with,  any  transaction,  event,
circumstance,  action,  failure  to act,  or.  occurrence  of any  sort or type,
whether known or unknown,  which occurred,  existed,  was taken,  permitted,  or
begun prior to the execution of this Agreement and occurred, existed, was taken,
permitted  or begun  in  accordance  with,  pursuant  to,  or by  virtue  of the
Indebtedness  or any of the terms or conditions of the Financing  Documents,  or
which  directly  or  indirectly  relate to or arise out of or in any  manner are
connected with the Indebtedness or any of the Financing Documents; to the extent
any such  defenses,  affirmative  or  otherwise,  rights  of  setoff,  rights of
recoupment, claims, counterclaims, actions or causes of action exist or existed,
such defenses, rights, claims,  counterclaims,  actions and causes of action are
hereby forever waived,  discharged and released. The Obligors hereby acknowledge
and  agree  that  the  execution  of this  Agreement  by the  Lender  shall  not
constitute an  acknowledgment of or admission by the Lender or any member of the
Lender Group of the  existence  of any claims or of liability  for any matter or
precedent  upon  which any claim or  liability  may be  asserted.  The  Obligors
further  acknowledge  and agree  that,  to the extent any such claims may exist,
they are of a  speculative  nature so as to be incapable of objective  valuation
and that,  in any event,  the value to each of the Obligors of the covenants and
obligations of the Lender  contained in this  Agreement and the other  documents
executed and  delivered in  connection  with this  Agreement  substantially  and
materially  exceeds  any and all value of any kind or nature  whatsoever  of any
such claims.  The Obligors  further  acknowledge and agree that Lender is not in
any way responsible or liable for the previous,  current or future  condition or
deterioration of the business  operations  and/or financial  condition of any of
the Obligors and that the Lender has not breached any agreement or commitment to
loan money or otherwise make financial  accommodations available to the Borrower
or to fund any operations of the Borrower at any time.

NOT BE EXTINGGUISHED BY ANY JUDGMENT  ENTERED PURSUANT  THERETO;  SUCH AUTHORITY
AND POWER MAY BE EXERCISED ON ONE OR MORE  OCCASIONS  FROM TIME TO TIME,  IN THE

INDIVIDUAL  TO INDUCE  THIS  WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR TO IN ANY WAY  MODIFY OR
NULLIFY  ITS  EFFECT.  THE  OBLIGORS  FURTHER  REPRESENT  THAT  THEY  HAVE  BEEN
REPRESENTED IN THE SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY

     17. RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC  STAY. THE BORROWER HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND
AGREES  THAT THE  LENDER HAS  AGREED TO ENTER  INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  IN ORDER TO
PERMIT THE BORROWER AN  OPPORTUNITY TO REPAY AND SATISFY THE  INDEBTEDNESS  IN A
MUTUALLY  ACCEPTABLE,  CONSENSUAL  MANNER,  RATHER  THAN  THROUGH  THE  LENDER'S
EXERCISE  AND  ENFORCEMENT  OF ITS  RIGHTS  AND  REMEDIES  UNDER  THE  FINANCING
AGREEMENT,  THE FINANCING  DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE  LAWS. THE BORROWER  FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGES  AND AGREES  THAT  BECAUSE OF THE  EXISTING  DEFAULTS  UNDER AND IN
CONNECTION  WITH THE  INDEBTEDNESS,  THE LENDER  WOULD  OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO
EXERCISE  IMMEDIATELY ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS AND REMEDIES IF THE LENDER DID NOT
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  THE BORROWER  FURTHER  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND AGREES THAT
ALTHOUGH THE LENDER'S  INTEREST IN ITS  COLLATERAL AND SECURITY IS NOT PRESENTLY
BEING  ADEQUATELY  PROTECTED,  THE  LENDER  HAS BEEN  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT  IN  RELIANCE  UPON THE  UNDERSTANDING  THAT IN THE EVENT  THE  LENDER
EXERCISES ANY OF ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES UNDER THE FINANCING AGREEMENT AND/OR ANY
OR ALL OF THE  FINANCING  DOCUMENTS  AND/OR UNDER ANY  APPLICABLE  LAWS UPON THE
OCCURRENCE OF A FORBEARANCE DEFAULT, THE BORROWER WILL COOPERATE WITH THE LENDER
IN THE  LENDER'S  EFFORTS  TO  EXERCISE  ANY AND ALL SUCH  RIGHTS  AND  REMEDIES
AVAILABLE TO THE LENDER.  ACCORDINGLY,  IF THE BORROWER BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF A
BANKRUPTCY  CASE, THE BORROWER  CONSENTS TO ALLOW THE LENDER TO EXERCISE ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES  AVAILABLE TO THE LENDER WITH RESPECT TO ITS  COLLATERAL
AND SECURITY.  THE BORROWER  HEREBY CONSENTS TO ANY MOTION FILED BY OR ON BEHALF
OF THE LENDER FOR RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY UNDER SECTION 362 OF THE UNITED
STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY  AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS
THE LENDER TO FILE THIS CONSENT WITH THE  BANKRUPTCY  COURT  PRESIDING  OVER ANY
SUCH BANKRUPTCY CASE OF THE BORROWER,  AND FURTHER AGREES NOT TO OPPOSE ANY SUCH
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM THE  AUTOMATIC  STAY FILED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE LENDER.
FINALLY, THE BORROWER CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT NONE OF THE COLLATERAL (INCLUDING
ANY  CASH OR  NON-CASH  PROCEEDS  THEREOF)  MAY BE USED  TO PAY  ANY  ACTUAL  OR
ESTIMATED  FEES  INCURRED BY OR ESTIMATED  TO BE INCURRED BY THE  BORROWER  WITH
RESPECT TO ANY FILED OR PROPOSED  BANKRUPTCY  CASE IN WHICH THE  BORROWER IS THE
SUBJECT.
