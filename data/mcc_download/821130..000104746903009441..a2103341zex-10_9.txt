                       SUMMARY OF 2002 BONUS PROGRAM FOR
                          EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTS OF
                       UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION

     The objectives of the 2002 Bonus Program for Executive Vice Presidents (the
"2002 Bonus Plan") of United States Cellular Corporation ("USM") are: (i) to
provide incentives for the Executive Vice Presidents of USM to extend their best
efforts to achieve superior results in relation to key performance targets,
(ii) to reward USM's Executive Vice Presidents in relation to their success in
meeting and exceeding these performance targets, and (iii) to help USM attract
and retain talented leadership in positions of critical importance to the
success of USM.

     The 2002 Bonus Plan was designed to generate a targeted 2002 bonus pool
equal to the total of 40% of the aggregate of the base salaries of the Company's
senior executive officers other than the President. Under the 2002 Bonus Plan,
the size of the target bonus pool is increased or decreased depending on USM's
2002 achievements with respect to the performance categories. No bonus pool is
paid under such plan if minimum performance levels are not achieved in these
categories. The maximum bonus pool that could be generated, which would require
exceptional performance in all areas, would equal the total of 80% of the
aggregate base salaries of the Company's senior executive officers other than
the president. At target performance, the bonus pool would be equal to 40% of
the aggregate salaries of the Company's senior executive officers other than the
President. The performance categories include (i) gross post-pay customer
additions; (ii) consolidated cash flow; (iii) consolidated revenue; (iv) return
on capital; and (v) customer defections.
