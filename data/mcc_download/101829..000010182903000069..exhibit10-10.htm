<p ALIGN="CENTER">UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION<br>
PENSION REPLACEMENT PLAN<br>
<u>AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1996</u></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="left">1. <u>INTRODUCTION &amp; PURPOSE</u></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="left">The United Technologies Corporation Pension Replacement Plan (the
&quot;Replacement Plan&quot;) is maintained as an unfunded plan solely for the purpose of
providing retirement benefits in excess of the retirement and survivor benefits that may
be paid from the United Technologies Corporation Employee Retirement Plan (or any other
tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation) (the
&quot;Qualified Retirement Plan&quot;) and the United Technologies Corporation Pension
Preservation Plan as a result of any reduction in a Participant&#146;s compensation that
would otherwise be utilized in computing accrued benefits under such Plans where the
reduction results from participation in the Corporation&#146;s Deferred Compensation Plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="left">The capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given to them by
the United Technologies Corporation Employee Retirement Plan unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">2. <u>EFFECTIVE DATE</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Replacement Plan became effective on April 1, 1985 as the United
Technologies Corporation Supplemental Plan, which was subsequently renamed the United
Technologies Corporation Pension Replacement Plan. This amendment and restatement of the
Replacement Plan shall be effective January 1, 1996<b>, </b>except to the extent otherwise
specifically provided herein.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">3. <u>ELIGIBILITY</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">An<b> </b>employee of United Technologies Corporation (the
&quot;Corporation&quot;) or an affiliate thereof who is a Participant in the Qualified
Retirement Plan and the Pension Preservation Plan (if applicable) shall be eligible to
participate in the Replacement Plan if and to the extent the Participant&#146;s Accrued
Benefit under the Qualified Retirement Plan or the Pension Preservation Plan is reduced as
a result of participation in the United Technologies Corporation Deferred Compensation
Plan or other similar deferred compensation arrangement if the Corporation authorizes the
replacement of pension benefits in such arrangement (the &quot;Deferred Compensation
Plan&quot;). In no event shall any person who is not entitled to benefits under the
Qualified Retirement Plan be eligible for retirement benefits or survivor benefits under
the Replacement Plan. An employee of the Corporation or an affiliate thereof who is
eligible for retirement benefits under the Replacement Plan shall be referred to herein as
a &quot;Participant.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">4. <u>DETERMINATION OF REPLACEMENT PLAN BENEFIT</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The amount of the retirement benefit or survivor benefit payable from the
Replacement Plan to or in respect of a Participant shall equal the excess, if any, of (a)
over (b), where</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">(a) equals the retirement benefit or survivor benefit that would be paid
  to such Participant (or on his or her behalf to his Contingent Annuitant or Beneficiary)
  under the Qualified Retirement Plan and the Pension Preservation Plan if the provisions of
  such Plans were administered by taking into account any compensation that was deferred
  under the Deferred Compensation Plan; and</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">(b) equals the retirement benefit or survivor benefit payable to such
  Participant (or on his or her behalf to his or her Contingent Annuitant or Beneficiary)
  under the Qualified Retirement Plan and the Pension Preservation Plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">5. <u>FORM OF PRESERVATION PLAN BENEFIT</p>
</u></b>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">(a) The Plan Administrator shall determine, as of the earlier of the
  Participant&#146;s Retirement Date or the Participant&#146;s date of death, that portion
  of the Participant&#146;s total retirement benefit or survivor benefit that is to be paid
  under the Replacement Plan. The Replacement Plan retirement benefit or survivor benefit
  shall be paid to the Participant, or on his or her behalf to any Contingent Annuitant or
  Beneficiary (as designated under the Qualified Retirement Plan), in the form of
  distribution that applies to the benefit payments made to, or on behalf of, the
  Participant under the Qualified Retirement Plan unless the Participant has made a timely
  election to receive his or her Replacement Plan retirement benefit in a single lump-sum
  payment or in a series of 2 to 10 annual installment payments in accordance with this
  Section 5.</p>
  <p align="left">(b) If&#151;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">(i) the Participant qualifies for an Early Retirement Annuity or a Normal
    Retirement Annuity or satisfies the Rule of 65 under Section 5.4 of the United
    Technologies Corporation Employee Retirement Plan (or dies after qualifying for an Early
    Retirement Annuity or a Normal Retirement Annuity or satisfying such Rule of 65, but
    before the date as of which retirement benefits under the Qualified Retirement Plan are
    scheduled to begin), and</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">(ii) terminates, or retires from, employment with the Corporation and its
    affiliates after December 31, 1995,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">the Participant may elect, in accordance with Section 5(c) hereof, to have
  his or her Replacement Plan retirement benefit or survivor benefit paid in a lump sum or
  in annual installments, payable (or commencing) as of the Participant&#146;s Retirement
  Date. Subject to the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof, a Participant may revoke any such
  election at any time. A<b> </b>Participant shall have no right under the Replacement Plan
  to have his or her Qualified Retirement Plan benefit paid in a lump sum or in annual
  installments. Distributions from the Qualified Retirement Plan shall be governed solely by
  the terms of the Qualified Retirement Plan.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">(c) An election to have a lump-sum or installment distribution paid
  pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof (or a revocation of any such election) shall be
  disregarded unless it is filed at least one year before the Participant&#146;s Retirement
  Date (or, if earlier, the first day of the month next following the Participant&#146;s
  date of death), except that</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left">(i) If such an election or revocation is filed on or before October 30,
    1996, the election or revocation shall be given effect only if the Participant consents to
    a distribution (or the commencement of distributions) under the Replacement Plan as of a
    date occurring on or after January 1,1997; and</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">(ii) If such an election or revocation is filed on or after November 1,
    1996, and on or before December 31, 1996, the election or revocation shall be given effect
    only if the Participant consents to a distribution (or the commencement of distributions)
    under the Replacement Plan as of a date occurring on or after April 1,1997.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">(d) If a Participant elects to have his or her Replacement Plan benefit
  paid in the form of a single lump-sum or annual installment distribution, the Actuarially
  Equivalent present value of the Replacement Plan retirement benefit or survivor benefit
  shall be determined using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table and an interest
  assumption equal to the average yield for tax-free municipal bonds of 10-year maturities,
  averaged over the prior 5 calendar years. For purposes of computing this interest
  assumption, the Actuary shall utilize the Lehman Bros. Municipal Bond Index, averaging the
  published yield for 10-year maturities (credit quality AA or above) on the last business
  day of the year over the most recent 5 consecutive full calendar year period. This rate
  shall be adjusted annually at the beginning of each calendar year.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">(e) The payment of a lump sum or annual installment distribution in
  accordance with this Section 5 shall be in full satisfaction of all of the
  Corporation&#146;s obligations with respect to the Participant under the Replacement Plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">6. <u>DEATH BENEFITS</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">A Participant who has made an election to receive Replacement Plan
benefits in a lump sum or annual installments in accordance with Section 5 herein and such
election is effective as of the date of the Participant&#146;s death shall have survivor
benefits paid to his or her Replacement Plan Beneficiary as follows. If death occurs prior
to age 55, the Replacement Plan benefits shall be paid in a lump sum payment as of the
date the Participant would have attained his or her 55th birthday. If death occurs after
retirement but before all annual installments have been paid, the remaining installments
will be paid to his or her Beneficiary as scheduled unless the estate of the Participant
is the Beneficiary in which case the commuted value of the remaining payments will be paid
in a lump sum. </p>

<p ALIGN="left">If no election to receive Replacement Plan benefits in a lump sum or
installments is in effect as of the date of death, any survivor benefits will be paid in
accordance with the distribution option in effect and to the Beneficiary or Contingent
Annuitant designated under the Qualified Retirement Plan.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">7. <u>FUNDING</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Replacement Plan shall be maintained as an unfunded Plan that is not
intended to meet the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Code. Except in the
event of a Change in Control of the Corporation (as described in Section 7 hereof), all
benefits under the Replacement Plan shall be payable solely from the general assets of the
Corporation. In this regard, the rights of each Participant, Contingent Annuitant and
Beneficiary under the Replacement Plan with respect to his or her Preservation Plan
retirement benefit or survivor benefit shall be those of a general unsecured creditor of
the Corporation. No Participant, Contingent Annuitant or Beneficiary hereunder shall be
entitled to receive any benefits payable under the Replacement Plan from the assets of the
Qualified Retirement Plan, nor shall the Corporation undertake to set aside assets in
trust or otherwise segregate assets to fund its obligations under the Replacement Plan
except as provided in Section 7 hereof.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">8. <u>CHANGE OF CONTROL</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">In the event of a Change of Control of the Corporation, the Corporation
shall immediately fully fund the value of all Accrued Benefits under the Replacement Plan,
determined by the Actuary as of the date of the Change of Control. The required proceeds
will be contributed to the United Technologies Corporation Pension Replacement Plan
Retirement Security Trust. In addition, if the United Technologies Corporation Board of
Directors Committee on Compensation and Executive Development takes any action under the
United Technologies Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan (the &quot;LTIP&quot;<b>) </b>including,
without limitation, the accelerated vesting or other adjustment to outstanding LTIP awards
in anticipation of (i) a Change of Control (ii) an event, which if consummated, would
constitute a Change of Control or (iii) any other significant change pertaining to the
ownership of the Corporation, the Corporation shall then also immediately fund the United
Technologies Corporation Pension Replacement Plan Retirement Security Trust. For purposes
of this Section 7, &quot;Change of Control&quot; shall have the meaning given to that term
under the LTIP.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">9. <u>NONASSIGNABILITY</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">No<b> </b>Participant, Contingent Annuitant or Beneficiary or any other
person shall have the right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber any
interest in the Replacement Plan. All Replacement Plan benefits are unassignable and
non-transferable and shall not be subject to attachment or seizure for the payment of any
debts, judgments or other obligations. No Replacement Plan interest shall be transferred
by operation of law in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a Participant,
Contingent Annuitant, or Beneficiary.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">10. <u>NO CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">Participation in the Replacement Plan shall not be construed to constitute
a direct or indirect contract of employment between the Corporation and the Participant.
Nothing in the Replacement Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be
retained in the service of the Corporation for any length of time. Participants,
Contingent Annuitants and Beneficiaries shall have no rights against the Corporation
resulting from participation in the Replacement Plan other than as specifically provided
herein.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">11<i>. </i><u>OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATION</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Replacement Plan shall be administered by the Pension Administration
and Investment Committee of United Technologies Corporation (the &quot;Committee&quot;).
The Committee shall have the right to delegate its responsibilities hereunder to
sub-committees and individuals. Any question of administration or interpretation arising
under the Replacement Plan shall be determined by the Committee (or its delegate) in its
full discretion, and its decision shall be final and binding upon all parties.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">12. <u>TAXES/WITHHOLDING</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Corporation shall have the right to withhold taxes from Replacement
Plan benefit payments to the extent it reasonably determines such withholding to be
required by law.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">13. <u>GOVERNING LAW</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Replacement Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced in
accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(&quot;ERISA&quot;), and to the extent not preempted thereby, the laws of the State of
Connecticut (disregarding its choice-of-law rules).</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">14. <u>AMENDMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">The Corporation expects to continue the Replacement Plan indefinitely, but
reserves the right, by action of the Committee, to amend or discontinue the Replacement
Plan at any time, provided, however, that no such action shall decrease any benefits
accrued under the Replacement Plan as of the date of such action. Although the benefits
accrued under the Replacement Plan are not subject to the restrictions imposed by Section
204(g) of ERISA, the proviso in the preceding sentence shall be construed in a manner
consistent with Section 204(g) of ERISA. As a result, the proviso referred to in the
preceding sentence imposes restrictions identical with the restrictions that would be
imposed on the Replacement Plan if the Replacement Plan were subject to Section 204(g) of
ERISA<b>.</p>

<p ALIGN="left">15. <u>SUCCESSORS</u></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="left">The provisions of the Replacement Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit
of the Corporation, and its successors and assigns. The term successors shall include any
corporate or other business entity that by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise
acquires all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Corporation, and
successors of any such Corporation or other entity.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="left">16. <u>BENEFIT CLAIMS PROCEDURE</p>
</u></b>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">(a) The Plan Administrator shall establish and communicate procedures for
  Participants to obtain forms required to effect elections and designations under the Plan.
  The Plan Administrator may establish a telephonic communication system to facilitate the
  administration of the Plan and to provide information to Participants, provided that any
  estimate of a Participant&#146;s current or projected accrued benefit shall in no event be
  binding on the Plan Administrator in the event of any discrepancy between such estimate
  and a Participant&#146;s actual Accrued Benefit, which, in all cases, shall control. Upon
  notification of the death of any Participant while in the employment of the Employer, the
  Plan Administrator may initiate any claim on behalf of the Spouse, Contingent Annuitant,
  or Beneficiary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">(b) If a claim is denied, the Plan Administrator or its designated agent
  shall give the claimant notice in writing of such denial, which notice shall set forth (i)
  the specific reason(s) for the denial; (ii) specific reference to pertinent Plan
  provisions on which the denial is based; (iii) a description of any additional material or
  information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
  materials or information are necessary; and (iv) an explanation of the Plan&#146;s claim
  review procedure.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">(c) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice of denial described above,
  the claimant may request a review of such denial by filing a notice of appeal in writing
  with the Benefit Claims Appeal Committee (the &quot;Benefits Appeal Committee&quot;). Such
  notice must set forth all relevant factors upon which the appeal is based. The Benefits
  Appeal Committee shall decide the issues raised by the appeal, either with or without
  holding a hearing, and shall issue to the claimant a written notice setting forth its
  decision and the reasons for the decision. The Benefits Appeal Committee&#146;s decision
  shall be made not more than 60 days after it has received the claimant&#146;s request for
  review, unless the Benefits Appeal Committee determines that special circumstances require
  an extension of time and so notifies the claimant, in which case a decision shall be made
  not more than 120 days after it has received the request for review. The Benefits Appeal
  Committee shall have the greatest discretion permitted by law in making decisions pursuant
  to this Section 16. All interpretations, determinations, and decisions of the Benefits
  Appeal Committee in respect of any claim shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons
  having or claiming to have any interest or right under the Plan.</p>
