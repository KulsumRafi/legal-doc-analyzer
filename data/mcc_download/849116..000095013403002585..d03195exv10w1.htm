awarded to the Grantee pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award, and upon such
vesting, all Forfeiture Restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock Award
shall lapse or terminate. Any action by the Committee pursuant to this Section
13(h) may vary among individual Grantees and may vary among the Restricted
Stock Awards held by any individual Grantee. Notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this Section&nbsp;13(h), the Committee may not take any action
described in this Section&nbsp;13(h) with respect to a Restricted Stock Award that
has been designed to meet the exception for performance-based compensation
under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
