    Security Agreement Form SA-AR 7/3/97

<PAGE>



GENERALLY - "You" means the Secured Party identified on page 1 of this
agreement. "I," "me" and "my" means each person who signs this security
agreement as Debtor and who agrees to give the property described in this
agreement as security for the Secured Debts. All terms and duties under this
agreement are joint and individual. No modification of this security agreement
is effective unless made in writing and signed by you and me. This security
agreement remains in effect, even if the note is paid and I owe no other debt to
you, until discharged in writing. Time is of the essence in this agreement.

APPLICABLE LAW - I agree that this security agreement will be
governed by the law of the state in which you are located. If property described
in this agreement is located in another state, this agreement may also, in some
circumstances, be governed by the law of the state in which the property is
located.
         To the extent permitted by law, the terms of this agreement may vary
applicable law. If any provision of applicable law may not be varied by
agreement, any provision of this agreement that does not comply with that law
will not be effective. If any provision of this agreement cannot be enforced
according to its terms, this fact will not affect the enforceability of the
remainder of this agreement.

OWNERSHIP AND DUTIES TOWARD PROPERTY - I represent that I own all of the
property, or to the extent this is a purchase money security interest I will
acquire ownership of the property with the proceeds of the loan. I will defend
it against any other claim. Your claim to the property is ahead of the claims of
any other creditor. I agree to do whatever you require to protect your security
interest and to keep your claim in the property ahead of the claims of other
creditors. I will not do anything to harm your position.

         I will keep books, records and accounts about the property and my
business in general. I will let you examine these records at any reasonable
time. I will prepare any report or accounting you request, which deals with the
property.

         I will keep the property in my possession and will keep it in good
repair and use it only for the purpose(s) described on page 1 of this agreement.
I will not change this specified use without your express written permission. I
represent that I am the original owner of the property and, if I am not, that I
have provided you with a list of prior owners of the property.

         I will keep the property at my address listed on page 1 of this
agreement, unless we agree I may keep it at another location. If the property is
to be used in another state, I will give you a list of those states, I will not
try to sell the property unless it is inventory or I receive your written
permission to do so. If I sell the property I will have the payment made payable
to the order of you and me.

         You may demand immediate payment of the debt(s) if the debtor is not a
natural person and without your prior written consent (1) a beneficial interest
in the debtor is sold or transferred or (2) there is a change in either the
identity or number of members of a partnership or (3) there is a change in
ownership of more than 25 percent of the voting stock of a corporation.

         I will pay all taxes and charges on the property as they become due.
You have the right of reasonable access in order to inspect the property. I will
immediately inform you of any loss or damage to the property.

LIMITATIONS - This agreement will not secure a debt described in the section
entitled "Secured Debts" on page 1:

         1)   if you fail to make any disclosure of the existence of this
              security interest required by law for such other debt;

         2)   if this security interest is in my principal dwelling and you fail
              to provide (to all persons entitled) any notice of right of
              rescission required by law for such other debt;

         3)   to the extent that this security interest is in "household goods"
              and the other debt to be secured in a "consumer" loan (as those
              terms are defined in applicable federal regulations governing
              unfair and deceptive credit practices);

         4)   if this security interest is in margin stock subject to the
              requirements of 12 C.F.R. Section 207 or 221 and you do not obtain
              a statement of purpose if required under these regulations with
              respect to that debt; or

         5)   if this security interest is unenforceable by law with respect to
              that debt.

PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTEREST - For the sole purpose of determining the
extent of a purchase money security interest arising under this security
agreement: (a) payments on any non-purchase money loan also secured by this
agreement will not be deemed to apply to the purchase money loan, and (b)
payments on the will be deemed to apply first to the non-purchase money portion
of the loan, if any, and then to the purchase money obligations in the order in
which the items of collateral were acquired or if acquired at the same time, in
the order selected by you. No security interest will be terminated by
application of this formula. "Purchase money loan" means any loan the proceeds
of which, in whole or in part, are used to acquire any collateral securing the
loan and all extensions, renewals, consolidations and refinancings of such loan.

AUTHORITY OF SECURED PARTY TO MAKE ADVANCES AND PERFORM FOR DEBTOR - I agree to
pay you on demand any sums you advanced on my behalf including, but not limited
to, expenses incurred in collecting, insuring, conserving, or protecting the
property or in any inventories, audits, inspections or other examinations by you
in respect to the property. If I fail to pay such sums, you may do so for me,
adding the amount paid to the other amounts secured by this agreement. All such
sums will be due on demand and will bear interest at the highest rate provided
in any agreement, note or other instrument evidencing the Secured Debt(s) and
permitted by law at the time of the advance.

         If I fail to perform any of my duties under this security agreement, or
any mortgage, deed of trust, lien or other security interest, you may without
notice to me perform the duties or cause them to be performed. I understand that
this authorization includes, but is not limited to, permission to: (1) prepare,
file, and sign my name to any necessary reports or accountings; (2) notify any
account debtor of your interest in this property and tell the account debtor to
make the payments to you or someone else you name, rather than me; (3) place on
any chattel paper a note indicating your interest in the property; (4) in my
name, demand, collect, receive and give a receipt for, compromise, settle, and
handle any suits or other proceedings involving the collateral; (5) take any
action you feel is necessary in order to realize on the collateral, including
performing any part of a contract or endorsing it in my name; and (6) make an
entry on my books and records showing the existence of the security agreement.
Your right to perform for me shall not create an obligation to perform and your
failure to perform will not preclude you from exercising any of your other
rights under the law or this security agreement.

INSURANCE - I agree to buy insurance on the property against the risks of loss
or damage and for the amounts you require and to furnish you continuing proof of
coverage. I will have the insurance company name you as a loss payee on any such
policy. You may require added security if you agree that insurance proceeds may
be used to repair or replace the property. I will buy insurance from a firm
licensed to do business in the state where you are located. The firm will be
reasonably acceptable to you. The insurance will last until the property is
released from this agreement. If I fail to obtain or maintain this insurance ,
or name you as a loss payee, you may obtain insurance to protect your interest
in the property. This insurance may include coverages not required of me. This
insurance may be written by a company other than one I would choose. It may be
written at a rate higher than a rate I could obtain if I purchased the property
insurance required by this Contract. You will add the

premium for this insurance to the amount I owe you. Any amount you pay will be
due immediately. This amount will earn finance charges from the date paid.

WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS - If this agreement includes accounts, I will not
settle any account for less than its full value without your written permission.
I will collect all accounts until you tell me otherwise. I will keep the
proceeds from all the accounts and any good which are returned to me or which I
take back in trust for you. I will not mix them with any other property of mine.
I will deliver them to you at your request. If you ask me to pay you the full
price on any returned items or items retaken by myself, I will do so.

         If this agreement covers inventory, I will not dispose of it except in
my ordinary course of business as the fair market value for the property, or at
a minimum price established between you and me.

         If this agreement covers farm products I will provide you, at your
request, a written list of the buyers, commission merchants or selling agents to
or through whom I may sell farm products. In addition to those parties named on
this written list, I authorize you to notify at your sole discretion any
additional parties regarding your security interest in my farm products. I
remain subject to all applicable penalties for selling my farm products in
violation of my agreement with you and the Food Security Act. In this paragraph
the terms farm products, buyers, commission merchants and selling agents have
the meanings given to them in the Federal Food Security Act of 1985.

DEFAULT - I will be in default if any one or more of the following occur: (1) I
fail to make a payment on time or in the amount due; (2) I fail to keep the
property insured, if require; (3) I fail to pay, or keep any promise, on any
debt or agreement I have with you; (4) any other creditor of mine attempts to
collect any debt I owe him trough court proceedings; (5) I die, am declared
incompetent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or become
insolvent (either because my liabilities exceed my assets or I am unable to pay
my debts as they may become due); (6) I make any written statement or provide
any financial information that is untrue or inaccurate at the time it was
provided; (7) I do or fail to do something which causes you to believe that you
will have difficulty collecting the amount I owe you; (8) I change my name or
assume an additional name without first notifying you before making such a
change; (9) failure to plant, cultivate and harvest crops in due season; (10) if
any loan proceeds are used for purpose that will contribute to excessive erosion
of highly erodible land or to the conversion of wetlands to produce an
agricultural commodity, as further explained in 7 C.F.R. Part 1940, Subpart G,
Exhibit M.

REMEDIES - If I am in default on this agreement, you have the following
remedies:

         1)   You may demand immediate payment of all I owe you under any
              obligation secured by this agreement.

         2)   You may set off any obligation I have to you against any right I
              have to the payment of money from you.

         3)   You may demand more security or new parties obligated to pay any
              debt I owe you as a condition of giving up any other remedy.

         4)   You may make use of any remedy you have under state or federal
              law.

         5)   If I default by failing to pay taxes or other charges, you may pay
              them (but you are not required to do so). If you do, I will repay
              to you the amount you paid plus interest at the highest contract
              rate.

         6)   You may require me to gather the property and make it available to
              you in a reasonable fashion.

         7)   You may repossess the property and sell it as provided by law. You
              may repossess the property so long as the repossession does not
              involve a breach of the peace or an illegal entry onto my
              property. You may sell the property as provided by law. You may
              apply what you receive from the sale of the property to: your
              expenses; your reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses
              (where not prohibited by law); any debt I owe you. If what you
              receive from the sale of the property does not satisfy the debts,
              you may take me to court to recover the difference (where
              permitted by law).

              I agree that 10 days written notice sent to my address listed on
              page 1 by first class mail will be reasonable notice to me under
              the Uniform Commercial Code.

              If any items not otherwise subject to this agreement are contained
              in the property when you take possession, you may hold these items
              for me at my risk and you will not be liable for taking possession
              of them.

         8)   In some cases, you may keep the property to satisfy the debt. You
              may enter upon and take possession of all or part of my property,
              so long as you do not breach the peace or illegally enter onto the
              property, including lands, plants, buildings, machinery, and
              equipment as may be necessary to permit you to manufacture,
              produce, process, store or sell or complete the manufacture,
              production, processing, storing or sale of any of the property and
              to use and operate the property for the length of time you feel is
              necessary to protect your interest, all without payment or
              compensation to me.

         By choosing any one or more of these remedies, you do not waive your
right to later use any other remedy. You do not waive a default if you choose
not to use any remedy, and, by electing not to use any remedy, you do not waive
your right to later consider the event a default and to immediately use any
remedies if it continues or occurs again.

FILING - A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this security agreement
or the financing statement covering the property described in this agreement may
be used as a financing statement where allowed by law. Where permitted by law,
you may file a financing statement which does not contain my signature, covering
the property secured by this agreement.

CO-MAKERS - If more than one of us has signed this agreement, we are all
obligated equally under the agreement. You may sue any one of us or any of us
together if this agreement is violated. You do not have to tell me if any term
of the agreement has not been carried out. You may release any co-signer and I
will still be obligated under this agreement. You may release any of the
security and I will still be obligated under this agreement. Waiver by you of
any of your rights will not affect my duties under this agreement. Extending
this agreement or new obligations under this agreement, will not affect my duty
under this agreement.

interest rates, maturities or other contractual terms applicable to any
Indebtedness; (iii) any waiver, adjustment, forbearance, compromise or
indulgence granted to Borrower, any delay or lack of diligence in the
enforcement of Indebtedness, or any failure to institute proceedings, file a
claim, give any required notices or otherwise protect any Indebtedness; (iv) any
full or partial release of, settlement with, or agreement not to sue, Borrower
or any other guarantor or other person liable in respect of any Indebtedness;
(v) any discharge of any evidence of Indebtedness or the acceptance of any
instrument in renewal thereof or substitution therefor; (vi) any failure to
obtain collateral security (including rights of setoff) for Indebtedness, or see
to the proper or sufficient creation and perfection thereof, or to establish the
priority thereof, or to protect, insure, or enforce any collateral security; or
any release, modification, substitution, discharge, impairment, deterioration,
waste, or loss of any collateral security; (vii) any foreclosure or enforcement
of any collateral security; (viii) any transfer of any Indebtedness or any
evidence thereof; (ix) any order of application of any payments or credits upon
Indebtedness; (x) any election by the Lender under ss.111(b)(2) of the United
States Bankruptcy Code.

         7. The Undersigned waives any and all defenses, claims and discharges
of Borrower, or any other obligor, pertaining to Indebtedness, except the
defense of discharge by payment in full. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Undersigned will not assert, plead or enforce against Lender any
defense of waiver, release, statute of limitations, res judicata, statute of
frauds, fraud, incapacity, minority, usury, illegality or unenforceability which
may be available to Borrower or any other person liable in respect of any
Indebtedness, or any setoff available against Lender to Borrower or any such
other person, whether or not on account of a related transaction. The
Undersigned expressly agrees that the Undersigned shall be and remain liable, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, for any deficiency remaining
after foreclosure of any mortgage or security interest securing Indebtedness,
whether or not the liability of Borrower or any other obligor for such
deficiency is discharged pursuant to statute or judicial decision. The
undersigned shall remain obligated, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
pay such amounts as though the Borrower's obligations had not been discharged.

         8. The Undersigned further agrees that the Undersigned shall be and
remain obligated to pay Indebtedness even though any other person obligated to
pay Indebtedness, including Borrower, has such obligation discharged in
bankruptcy or otherwise discharged by law. "Indebtedness" shall include
post-bankruptcy petition interest and attorneys' fees and any other amounts
which Borrower is discharged from paying or which do not otherwise accrue to
Indebtedness due to Borrower's discharge, and the Undersigned shall remain
obligated to pay such amounts as though Borrower's obligations had not been
discharged.

         9. If any payments applied by Lender to Indebtedness is thereafter set
aside, recovered, rescinded or required to be returned for any reason
(including, without limitation, the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of
Borrower [or?] any other obligor), the Indebtedness to which such payment was
applied shall for the purpose of this guaranty [be deemed?] to have continued in
existence, notwithstanding such application, and this guaranty shall be
enforceable as to such Indebtedness as fully as if such application had never
been made.

         10. The Undersigned waives any claim, remedy or other right which the
Undersigned may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower or any other
person obligated to pay Indebtedness arising out of the creation or performance
of the Undersigned's obligation under this guaranty, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement,
indemnification, exoneration, and any right to participate in any claims or
remedy the Undersigned may have against the Borrower, collateral, or other party
obligated for Borrower's debts, whether or not such claim, remedy or right
arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law.

         11. The Undersigned waives the presentment, demand for payment, notice
of dishonor or nonpayment, and protest of any instrument evidencing
Indebtedness. Lender shall not be required first to resort for payment of the
Indebtedness to Borrower or other persons or their properties, or first to
enforce, realize upon or exhaust any collateral security for Indebtedness,
before enforcing this guaranty.

         12. The liability of the Undersigned under this guaranty is in addition
to and shall be cumulative with all other liabilities of the Undersigned to
Lender as guarantor or otherwise, without any limitation as to amount, unless
the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability
specifically provides to the contrary.

         13. This guaranty shall be enforceable against each person signing this
guaranty, even if only one person signs and regardless of any failure of other
persons to sign this guaranty. If there be more than one signer, all agreements
and promises herein shall be construed to be, and are hereby declared to be,
joint and several in each of every particular and shall be fully binding upon
and enforceable against either, any or all the Undersigned. This guaranty shall
be effective upon delivery to Lender, without further act, condition or
acceptance by Lender, shall be binding upon the Undersigned and the heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns of the Undersigned and shall inure to
the benefit of Lender and its participants, successors and assigns. Any
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or application of this guaranty
shall not affect other lawful provisions and application hereof, and to this end
the provisions of this guaranty are declared to be severable. Except as
authorized by the terms herein, this guaranty may not be waived, modified,
amended, terminated, released or otherwise changed except by a writing signed by
the Undersigned and Lender. This guaranty shall be governed by the laws of the
State in which it is executed. The Undersigned waives notice of Lender's
acceptance hereof.
