                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Merger Agreement"), dated as
of January 13, 2003, is by and among CONMED Corporation, a New York corporation
(the "Purchaser"), Arrow Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of the Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), and Bionx Implants, Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Purchaser and the Board of
Directors of the Company have each determined that it is advisable to merge the
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") pursuant to this Merger
Agreement, with the result that the holders of the outstanding shares (the
"Shares") of Common Stock of the Company, par value $.0019 per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), shall receive a payment in cash for each Share as
provided in this Merger Agreement and the Company shall become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Purchaser;

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Purchaser and the
Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with
their respective business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective shareholders, and the Purchaser has approved this Merger Agreement
and the Merger as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub; and

         WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to the Purchaser's and Merger
Sub's willingness to enter into this Merger Agreement, simultaneously with the
execution of this Merger Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are
entering into voting agreements with the Purchaser and Merger Sub (the "Voting
Agreements").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants herein contained, the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree as follows:

                                 1. THE MERGER

into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub (except as may be

         1.4 Consummation of the Merger. As soon as is practicable after the
Closing, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
Articles of Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of applicable law. The time of the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is
referred to herein as the "Effective Time".

         1.5 Articles of Incorporation; By Laws. The Articles of Incorporation
and By-Laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter shall continue to be its Articles of Incorporation
and By-Laws until amended as provided therein and under Pennsylvania Law.

         1.6 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation.

             (a) The directors of Merger Sub shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualify in the
manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law.

             (b) The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the
Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualify in the manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law.

         1.7 Dissenters Rights. In accordance with Section 1571 of the
Pennsylvania Law, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger.

                            2. Conversion and Payment

         2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of any of the securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

             (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
hereof) shall be canceled and extinguished and be converted into and represent
the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation $4.35 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). All such Shares, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders of the Shares, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.3.






                                       -2-
<PAGE>

             (b) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is (i) held in the treasury of the Company or (ii) owned by
the Purchaser or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Purchaser (including
the Merger Sub) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and
retired and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

             (c) Each share of common stock, par value $.0019 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

         2.2 Payment Fund. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent
(as defined in Section 2.3 hereof) in a separate fund established for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, for payment in accordance with this Article 2
through the Disbursing Agent (the "Payment Fund"), immediately available funds
in amounts necessary to make the payments pursuant to this Article 2 to holders
of Shares (other than the Company, the Purchaser, Merger Sub or any other
subsidiary of the Purchaser). The Disbursing Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions delivered prior to the Effective Time, pay the Merger
Consideration out of the Payment Fund.

         The Disbursing Agent shall invest portions of the Payment Fund as the
Purchaser directs in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest investment grade
rating from both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings
Services, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (collectively, "Permitted Investments");
provided, however, that the maturities of Permitted Investments shall be such as
to permit the Disbursing Agent to make prompt payment to former holders of
Shares entitled thereto as contemplated by this Article 2. The Purchaser shall
cause the Payment Fund to be promptly replenished to the extent of any losses
incurred as a result of Permitted Investments. All earnings of Permitted
Investments shall be paid to the Purchaser. If, for any reason (including losses
incurred as a result of Permitted Investments), the Payment Fund is inadequate
to pay the amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under this
Article 2, the Purchaser shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in
this Merger Agreement.

         2.3 Payment of Cash for Shares. Each holder of a certificate or
certificates representing Shares canceled upon consummation of the Merger
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof may thereafter surrender such certificate to a
disbursing agent to be designated by the Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory
to the Company (the "Disbursing Agent"), as agent for such holders of Shares, to
effect the surrender of such certificates on their behalf for a period ending
twelve months after the Effective Time. The Purchaser agrees that promptly after
the Effective Time it will distribute to such holders a form of letter of
transmittal and instructions (in the form and substance of a letter of
transmittal and instructions to be approved by the Company prior to the








                                       -3-
<PAGE>

Effective Time, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) for use in
effecting the surrender of the certificates which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Shares in exchange for payment therefor. Each such
holder shall be entitled upon surrender of one or more certificates formerly
representing Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, to receive in exchange
therefor a check representing the amount to which such holder is entitled in
respect of the canceled Shares represented by such certificates after giving
effect to any required federal, state or local withholding, transfer, stamp,
sales or similar Taxes. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such
certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the
right to receive such amount. If payment is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name a surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, with the registered owner's
signature guaranteed by a firm which is a member of a registered national
securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
or by a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in
the United States, and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Purchaser or the Disbursing Agent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not payable. If any of the cash deposited
with the Disbursing Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof for purposes of payment
in exchange for such Shares remains unclaimed following the expiration of 180
days after the Effective Time, such cash shall be delivered to the Purchaser by
the Disbursing Agent, and thereafter the Disbursing Agent shall not be liable to
any persons claiming any amount of such cash and the surrender and exchange
shall be effected directly with the Purchaser. None of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation, the Disbursing Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. No interest
shall accrue or be payable with respect to any amounts which any holder shall be
entitled to receive. The Purchaser or the Disbursing Agent shall be authorized
to pay the cash attributable to any certificate theretofore issued which has
been lost or destroyed, but only upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of
ownership of the Shares represented thereby and of appropriate indemnification.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing
ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein
or by law.

         2.4 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Merger Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full rights, title and possession to all assets, properties, rights, privileges,
immunities and franchises of either the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of each such corporation are fully authorized in the name of such
corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary
action.

         2.5 Transfer of Shares After Effective Time. No transfers of Shares
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation at or
after the Effective Time.

         2.6 Exercise and Cancellation of Company Options. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or, if appropriate, a
committee thereof shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions






                                       -4-
<PAGE>

necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each unexpired and unexercised option or similar right to purchase Company
Common Stock (the "Company Options or the "Stock Options") under the Company's
Stock Option Plan (as defined in Section 4.4 hereof) or Investment Plan (as
defined in Section 4.4 hereof) or any stock option plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans")
shall become exercisable and vested with respect to all of the shares of Company
Common Stock subject thereto, and, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled (except to the extent that such cancellation is not permitted under
the terms of the Company's Investment Plan) and, in exchange therefore, each
former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive,
in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement
therefore, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable Taxes required by
applicable law to be withheld) in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder with respect to all Company
Options being referred to as the "Option Payments"). From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable
by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment
of the Option Payment. The Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that
former holders of Company Options will have no rights other than the right to
receive their respective portion of the Option Payments, including obtaining
consents from holders of Company Options under the Company's Investment Plan.
The Company has delivered to the Purchaser consents signed by holders of Company
Options covering all but 18,624 of the shares issuable upon exercise of Company
Options granted pursuant to the Company's Investment Plan and shall use its best
efforts to obtain similar consents from all other holders of such Company
Options as soon as practicable. The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay any Option Payment not paid prior to the Effective Time.


               3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER


         The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

         3.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of the Purchaser and Merger
Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite corporate
power to carry on its respective business as now conducted. The Purchaser is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified is not reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Purchaser and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         3.2 Authority Relative to this Merger Agreement. Each of the Purchaser
and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Merger Agreement and to carry out its respective obligations hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement by the Purchaser and Merger Sub
and the consummation by the Purchaser and Merger Sub of the transactions






                                       -5-
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the respective Boards of
Directors of the Purchaser and Merger Sub and by the Purchaser as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Purchaser or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Merger Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Purchaser and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each such entity. Neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub is
subject to or obligated under any provision of (i) its respective Certificate or
Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, (ii) any contract, agreement, mortgage,
indenture or other document, (iii) any license, franchise or permit or (iv) any
law, regulation, order, judgment or decree, which would be breached or violated
or in respect of which a right of termination or acceleration or any encumbrance
on any of its assets would be created by its execution and performance of this
Merger Agreement, except (as to (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) where such breach,
violation or right would not individually, or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay the Purchaser or Merger Sub from performing its obligations
under this Merger Agreement. The consummation of Merger by the Purchaser and
Merger Sub will not require the consent or approval of any party other than (i)
satisfaction of applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), state "blue sky" or takeover laws and the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (ii) filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required
by the Pennsylvania Law and (iii) where failure to obtain such consents or
approvals would not prevent or materially delay the Purchaser or Merger Sub from
performing its obligations under this Merger Agreement.

         3.3 Financing. The Purchaser has cash, marketable securities or credit
available for use in connection with the acquisition of the Company in an
aggregate amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         3.4 Merger Sub Formation. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement. Since the
date of its incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business or
conducted any operations other than execution of this Merger Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and related ancillary matters.

         3.5 Ownership of Company Common Stock. As of the date of this Merger
Agreement, the Purchaser does not own any shares of Company Common Stock.


                4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to the Purchaser by the Company prior to entering
into this Merger Agreement (the "Disclosure Letter" or "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser and
Merger Sub that:

         4.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and has the requisite corporate power to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature







                                       -6-
<PAGE>

of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified would not have a "Material Adverse Effect". As used in this
Merger Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any development,
effect or change that, individually, or in the aggregate with such other
developments, effects or changes, has had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, revenues,
results of operations, properties, assets or liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.4 hereof), taken as a whole, other than
any such development, effect or change resulting from (i) the loss of revenues
from the Company's sales agents, distributors or dealers ("Distributors")
resulting from the announcement of this Merger Agreement or any payments made by
the Company to Distributors as described in Section 6.10 of the Disclosure
Letter, (ii) changes in general economic conditions in the United States or
abroad (including, without limitation, any effect that acts of terrorism or
outbreak of war have on such general economic conditions), or (iii) legal,
governmental or regulatory factors (including, without limitation, any effect
that acts or terrorism or outbreak of war have on such legal, governmental or
regulatory factors) generally affecting companies in the Company's industry;
provided, in each case of clauses (ii) and (iii), that the Company is not
materially disproportionately affected, as compared to other companies in the
Company's industry, by such developments, effects, changes or factors.

         4.2 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws in the form attached to Section 4.2 of the Disclosure
Letter are the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as in effect
on the date of this Merger Agreement.

         4.3 Subsidiaries. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is a corporation
or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power (corporate
or otherwise) to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each such
Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties, owned or leased, or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or ownership interests of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by
the Company or by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
all liens, claims, pledges or encumbrances, and there are no proxies outstanding
with respect to such shares or interests. Section 4.3 of the Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list of the ownership interests of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in the Subsidiaries and in any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture or other business association or entity.

         4.4 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"), and 31,600,000 shares of Company Common Stock. As of the

issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (iii) 99,716 shares of Company Common
Stock were held in the treasury of the Company, (iv) 2,181,313 shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's 1996 Stock
Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), a copy of which has been furnished
previously to the Purchaser, (v) 394,536 shares of Company Common Stock were







                                       -7-
<PAGE>

reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's Investment Plan (the "Investment
Plan"), a copy of which has been furnished previously to the Purchaser, (vi)
options to purchase 1,095,479 shares of Company Common Stock were outstanding
under the Stock Option Plan, and (vii) options to purchase 149,639 shares were
outstanding under the Investment Plan. Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete listing of all Stock Options outstanding on the date
hereof, showing, as of the date hereof, the names of the holders of such Stock
Options, the number of Stock Options so held and the exercise prices of such
Stock Options. Except as set forth above and except as set forth in Section 4.4
of the Disclosure Letter, there are not now, and at the Effective Time there
will not be, any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or
its Subsidiaries issued or outstanding, any preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are or
will be at the Effective Time authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company
does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any
matter. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will have no
obligation to issue, transfer or sell any Shares or common stock of the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to any Benefit Plan (as defined in Section
4.9(a), other than with respect to Company Options granted under the Investment
Plan that have not been cancelled).

         4.5 Authority Relative to this Merger Agreement; Approval; Fairness.
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Merger Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of this Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to authorize this Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for any required approval of the Merger
by holders of a majority of the votes cast at the Company Shareholders' Meeting
by holders of the Company Common Stock (assuming a quorum is present) as set
forth in Section 6.2 of this Merger Agreement (the "Company Requisite Vote").
This Merger Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in
accordance with its terms. The Board of Directors of the Company (A) has
unanimously approved this Merger Agreement and the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) has received the opinion of its financial advisors,
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, to the effect that the consideration to be received
by the holders of the Shares in the Merger is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view, a copy of which opinion shall be delivered to the
Purchaser within one (1) business day after the date hereof. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Merger Agreement by the Company do not, and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation
of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company
or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach
or violation of, a default under, the acceleration of any obligations under or
the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on the









                                       -8-
<PAGE>

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note,
mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation ("Contracts") binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Law (as defined in Section 4.13
hereof) or permit, franchise or license to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any
party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or change
that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Merger Agreement. Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list of Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
consents or waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement (whether or not subject to
the exception set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above). Except as
set forth in Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the
Merger by the Company and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not
require the consent or approval of or registration or filing with any Federal,
state or local government or any court, administrative or regulatory agency or
commission or other governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign, other
than (i) approval of the Company's shareholders, (ii) applicable requirements,
if any, of the Exchange Act, state "blue sky" or takeover laws and the HSR Act
and (iii) filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by
the Pennsylvania Law. To the knowledge of the Company, no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation (each, a "Takeover Statute") applies or
purports to apply to the Merger, this Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. To the full extent possible, the Company has
opted out of Sections 1715, 2538, 25E, 25F, 25G and 25H of the Pennsylvania Law.
By virtue of resolutions approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the
Merger, this Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will not
be subject to the provisions set forth in Article 11 of the Company's articles
of incorporation. Pursuant to Pennsylvania Law, no shareholder of the Company
shall have any dissenters or appraisal rights with respect to the Merger.

         4.6 Commission Filings. The Company has previously delivered to the
Purchaser (i) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2001, and any amendments thereto, as filed with the Securities and Exchange

         4.8 Litigation and Liabilities. Except as disclosed in Section 4.8 of
the Disclosure Letter or SEC Documents, there are no (i) civil, criminal or

         4.9 Employee Benefits.

             (a) True and complete copies of all documents comprising Benefit
Plans have been provided to the Purchaser. For purposes of this Merger
Agreement, the term "Benefit Plan" includes any plan, contract or arrangement
(regardless of whether funded or unfunded, or foreign or domestic) which is
sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries makes contributions or which covers any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in his or her capacity as an employee
or to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has any obligation with
respect to any current or former employee, and which is (i) an "Employee Benefit
Plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii) a severance contract with (an)
employee(s) or any severance plan applicable to employees, or (iii) a stock
option plan or any other plan of deferred compensation.

             (b) All Benefit Plans are valid and binding and in full force and
effect and there are no material defaults thereunder. Each Benefit Plan complies
currently, and has complied in the past, in all material respects in form and
operation, with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and other applicable law, except for failures to
comply which is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except
as set forth in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Letter, the Company does not
sponsor any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA ("Pension Plan") which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code or provide any retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit
Plan (excluding (i) continuation coverage required under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and (ii) as set forth in Section 4.9
of the Disclosure Letter, to the extent not material, any written arrangements
for post-termination of employment medical or life coverage between the Company
and any individual). There is no pending or, to the knowledge of senior
management of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Benefit Plans,
except for pending or threatened litigation that is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in, or failed to engage in, a
transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that is reasonably likely to
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 or 4980B of the Code or Section 502(i), 502(c), 502(1) and
601 through 608 of ERISA in an amount which would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

             (c) No Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (including any
"multiemployer plan" as defined in ERISA) has been sponsored or contributed to
by the Company or any Subsidiary during the six-year period immediately
preceding the date of this Merger Agreement.

             (d) All contributions required to be made, and claims to be paid,
under the terms of any Benefit Plan have been timely made or reserves therefor
on the balance sheet of the Company have been established, which reserves are
adequate in all material respects.

         4.10 Taxes. For the purposes of this Section 4.10, the term "Tax" shall
include all Taxes, charges, withholdings (including, without limitation, any
income, social security and employment Tax withholding for all types of
compensation), fees, levies, penalties, additions, interest or other assessments
imposed by any United States federal, state or local authority or any other
Taxing authority on the Company or any of its Tax Affiliates (as defined below)
as to their respective income, profit, franchise, gross receipts, payroll,
sales, employment, worker's compensation, use, property, withholding, excise,
occupancy, environmental and other Taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever. The Company has filed or caused to be filed timely (taking into
account all extensions validly applied by the Company) all material federal,
state, local and foreign Tax returns including all informational returns
required to be filed by each of it and any member of its consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar group (each such member, a "Tax Affiliate"). Such returns,
reports and other information are accurate and complete in all material
respects. The Company has made available to Purchaser true and correct copies of
the United States federal income Tax returns and Pennsylvania corporate income
Tax and capital stock and franchise Tax returns for each of the three most
recent years ending on or before December 31, 2002. The Company has timely paid
or caused to be paid or has made adequate provision or set up an adequate
accrual or reserve on its balance sheet (in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles) for the payment of, all Taxes due or payable (without
regard to whether such Taxes have been assessed) in respect of the periods for
which returns are due, and has established (or will establish at least
quarterly) an adequate accrual or reserve for the payment of all Taxes due or
payable (without regard to whether such Taxes have been assessed) in respect of
the first period following the last period for which returns are due. Neither
the Company nor any of its Tax Affiliates has any material liability for Taxes
in excess of the amount so paid or accruals or reserves so established. No
deficiencies for any Tax in excess of the amount reserved or provided therefor
has, to the knowledge of the senior management of the Company, been threatened,
claimed, proposed or assessed. No waiver or extension of time to assess any
Taxes has been given or requested and remains in effect on the date hereof. As
of the date hereof and except as disclosed in its SEC Documents or in Section
4.10 of the Disclosure Letter, there is no outstanding audit examination,
deficiency, refund litigation or outstanding waivers or agreements extending the
applicable statute of limitations for the assessment of collection of any Taxes
for any period with respect to any Taxes of the Company or any of its Tax
Affiliates. Neither the Company nor any of its Tax Affiliates is a party to any
Tax sharing, indemnification or similar agreement or any agreement pursuant to
which the Company or any of its Tax Affiliates has any obligation to any party
(other than Company or one of its Tax Affiliates) with respect to any Taxes or
is or was a member of any affiliated group filing combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax returns other than a group of which the Company is or was the common
parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Tax Affiliates has been a party to
any distribution occurring during the last two (2) years in which the parties to
such distribution treated such distribution as one to which Section 355 of the
Code applied. No liens with respect to Taxes exist with respect to Company or
any of its Tax Affiliates other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable or that are being contested in good faith and reserved for (in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) on the Company's
balance sheet.

governmental regulation or order, (b) the Company must change any of its
business practices to remain in compliance with any law, governmental regulation
or order, (c) the Company has failed to obtain any license or permit required

not being, conducted in violation in any material respect of any federal, state,
local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of
any governmental authority (collectively, "Laws"). Except as set forth in the
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, no investigation or review by any
governmental authority with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any
governmental authority indicated an intention to conduct the same. To the
knowledge of the Company, no material change is required in the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' processes, properties or procedures in connection with any
such Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or communication of any
material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date
hereof.

         4.14 Insurance. As of the date hereof, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are covered under insurance policies and programs which provide
coverage to the Company and its Subsidiaries by insurers, reasonably believed by
the Company to be of recognized financial responsibility and solvency, against
such losses and risks and in such amounts as are customary in the businesses in
which they are engaged. All material policies of insurance and fidelity or
surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors of which the Company has
copies have previously been made available for inspection by the Purchaser and
are in full force and effect. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.14 of
the Disclosure Letter or SEC Documents, as of the date hereof, there are no
material claims by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such policy or
instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending
under a reservation of rights clause other than a customary reservation of
rights clause. All necessary notifications of claims have been made to insurance
carriers other than those where the failure to so notify is not reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           threatened, which challenges the legality, validity,
                           enforceability, use or ownership of the Intellectual

pursuant to license, sublicense, agreement, or permission. The Company has

                           valid, binding, enforceable in accordance with its
                           terms, and in full force and effect in all material
                           respects;

                           is in material breach or default, and no event has
                           occurred which with notice or lapse of time would
                           constitute a material breach or default or permit
                           termination, modification, or acceleration
                           thereunder; and

                  (iii)    the Company and its Subsidiaries have not granted any
                           sublicense or similar right with respect to the
                           license, sublicense, agreement, or permission.

all reasonable efforts to have promptly cleared by the SEC and promptly mailed
to the Company's shareholders, a proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") with

The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the

or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the
time of the meeting of stockholders of the Company to be held in connection with
the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

be supplied by the Purchaser or Merger Sub in writing to the Company for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements contained therein, in light to the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Subject to the
fiduciary duty obligations of the Board of Directors of the Company under
Pennsylvania Law, the Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the Merger and for approval and

         6.3 Other Actions by the Company and Purchaser. If any Takeover Statute
is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Merger Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company shall use their best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Merger Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise use their
best efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation
on such transactions.

         6.4 Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or
otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or 25% or more of the assets or
25% or more of any equity securities of, it or any of its Subsidiaries (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal").
The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
direct and use its best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof who may be
involved in any such discussion of the obligations undertaken in this Section
and in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7). The Company
agrees that it will notify Purchaser immediately if any such inquiries,
proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or
any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers and thereafter shall keep Purchaser informed, on a current basis, as to
the status and terms of any such proposals or offers. The Company also agrees
that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it
or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries.

         6.5 Stock Exchange De-listing. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
best efforts to cause the Shares to no longer be quoted on the Nasdaq National

         6.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by
this Merger Agreement, including (i) filing the Certificate of Merger referred
to in Section 2.3, (ii) using reasonable efforts to remove any legal impediment
to the consummation or effectiveness of such transactions, (iii) satisfying the
conditions to each other parties' obligation to consummate the Merger as
contemplated hereby and (iv) using reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and
filings, including, but not limited to, filings under the HSR Act, if
applicable, and submissions of information requested by governmental
authorities. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance, and consult with the
Company on, all filings made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any governmental authority in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement.

         6.7 Expenses. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Disbursing Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article II hereof, and Purchaser shall reimburse
the Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.5(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Merger Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense.

         6.8 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

             (a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser agrees that it
will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company (when acting in such capacity) determined immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons"), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Pennsylvania law and its articles of incorporation or by-laws in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Indemnified Person (and Purchaser
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, provided the Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification); and provided,
further, that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
officer's or director's conduct complies with the standards set forth under
Pennsylvania law and the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws shall
be made by independent counsel reasonably acceptable to both the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Person.





                                      -23-
<PAGE>

             (b) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.8, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Purchaser of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Person if such failure does not materially prejudice
the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and Purchaser shall not be liable to such Indemnified Persons
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Persons in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Persons advises that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified
Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Purchaser
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent; and provided, further, that Purchaser shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

             (c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Purchaser shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

             (d) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
maintain in effect a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
covering only those persons currently covered by the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the "Insured Parties") for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts no less favorable in any material respect to such
Insured Parties than the terms in effect under the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy as in effect on the date of this Merger
Agreement; provided that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay an annual
premium therefor to the extent in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
payable prior to the date hereof; provided further that if the annual premiums
for such coverage exceeds such maximum amount, the Purchaser shall be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest standard coverage amount available for a
cost not exceeding such maximum amount. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the insurance policy or policies maintained under this
Section 6.8(d) from a reputable insurance carrier that has a financial strength
rating from A.M. Best (or its successor) that is equal to or better than the
financial strength rating that was assigned by A.M. Best to the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier on May 5, 2002. The
Purchaser's obligation to maintain the insurance policy or policies pursuant to
this Section 6.8(d) shall be contingent on the cooperation of the Insured
Parties in responding to reasonable requests for information from the Purchaser,
with all such communications to be made through a single intermediary designated
by the Insured Parties. Any costs and expenses incurred by any Insured Party or
the intermediary designated by the Insured Parties in connection with any such
requests shall be paid by the Insured Parties.





                                      -24-
<PAGE>

             (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

         6.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Merger Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time, provided that
each party's obligation hereunder is limited to events of which its senior
management has knowledge, and (ii) any material failure of the Company or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee or agent
thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The Company and Purchaser each shall
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other substantive communications received by Purchaser or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third
party and/or any governmental authority with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Purchaser of any change that could result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         6.10 Access; Communications with Distributors. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees and agents to,
afford the officers, employees and agents of the Purchaser complete access at
all reasonable times, from the date hereof to the Effective Time, to its
officers, employees, agents, properties, books and records and shall furnish the
Purchaser all financial, operating and other data and information as the
Purchaser, through its officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Purchaser agree to take the actions set forth in Section 6.10 of the Disclosure
Letter.

         6.11 Employee Benefits. The Purchaser and the Company agree that all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be employed by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time, it being understood that, except for
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with employment agreements as set
forth in Section 6.14, the Purchaser shall not have any obligation to continue
employing such employees for any length of time thereafter. Except as set forth
in Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser and the Company agree
that, after the Effective Time, all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, at the Purchaser's option (i) continue to be entitled to and
shall receive the same benefits currently provided to the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under the existing Company benefit plans ("Company
Plans") for three (3) months from the Effective Time so long as the continued
provision of such Company Plans to such employees does not cause any Purchaser
benefit plan to be in violation of any law or regulation governing such plans,
or (ii) shall be offered benefits similar to those available to the Purchaser's
employees. From and after three (3) months from the Effective Time, the then






                                      -25-
<PAGE>

employees of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to
and shall receive such benefits as the then constituted management of the
Surviving Corporation deems necessary and appropriate for the Purchaser, subject
to consent and advice from the Purchaser's executive management. With respect to
any such benefit arrangements ("Ultimate Plans"), the Purchaser shall grant all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, who become participants in the
Ultimate Plans after the Effective Time, credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or their respective predecessors (or any other party for
which service has been recognized by the Company), prior to the Effective Time

the Effective Time. To the extent that the Company Plans or Ultimate Plans
provide medical or dental welfare benefits after the Effective Time, the

on or before the Effective Time shall be taken into account under the Ultimate
Plans for purposes of satisfying the applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions. Subject to the rules governing eligibility,
vesting and all other terms of any 401(k) plan or other qualified retirement
plan or ERISA pension plan maintained by the Purchaser and its subsidiaries (the
"Retirement Plans"), the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
eligible to participate in the Retirement Plans on terms similar to the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser and its subsidiaries,
with credit granted for purposes of eligibility and vesting for prior service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries, but not for purposes of accrual. The
Purchaser shall permit the Company to fully vest the accounts of the
participants under the Company's 401k Plan effective as of the Effective Time.

         6.12 Antitrust Laws. As promptly as practicable, the Company, the

Purchaser and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company, such information and
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any such filings or submissions. Subject to Section 6.10 hereof,
the Company will provide the Purchaser and Merger Sub, and the Purchaser and
Merger Sub will provide the Company, with copies of all correspondence, filings

such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any governmental

provided, however, that the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall not be required to

included in any filings and submissions made by the Purchaser under the HSR Act
and the Company shall not be required to provide the Purchaser or Merger Sub
with copies of confidential documents or information included in any filings and

hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree that they will use reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party prior to issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement, including, without limitation, making any
filing with any third party or governmental authority, or responding to any

and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the approval by stockholders of the Company referred to in
Section 7.1(a), by action of the Board of Directors of the Company if there has

         8.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

             (a) In the event of termination of this Merger Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Merger Agreement
(other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect with
no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); provided, however, except as otherwise provided herein, no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful breach of this Merger Agreement.

             (b) In the event that this Merger Agreement is terminated by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.4 (a) or (c), then the Company shall promptly,
but in no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay
Purchaser a termination fee of $2,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") and shall
promptly, but in no event later than two days after being notified of such by
Purchaser, pay all of the out-of-pocket charges and expenses (but excluding any
investment banking fees), including those of the Disbursing Agent, incurred by
Purchaser or Merger Sub in connection with this Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement, in each case payable by wire
transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Merger Agreement, and that, without these agreements,
Purchaser and Merger Sub would not enter into this Merger Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser or Merger
Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in this paragraph (b), the Company shall pay to Purchaser or Merger
Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

         8.6 Amendment. This Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

         8.7 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of any other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by
a duly authorized officer.

                             9. GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1 GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. (a) THIS MERGER

in such a New York State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the

         9.4 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Merger Agreement
to subsidiaries of the Purchaser or the Company, the word "subsidiaries" or
"Subsidiaries" means any corporation or entity more than fifty percent (50%) of
whose outstanding voting securities or equity interests are directly or
indirectly owned by the Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be. The
headings contained in this Merger Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Merger
Agreement.

         9.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the current and former
officers and directors of the Company (who are third-party beneficiaries of the
provisions set forth in Section 6.8 hereof), there are no third party
beneficiaries of this Merger Agreement and nothing in this Merger Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities.

         9.6 Counterparts. This Merger Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, which together shall constitute a single agreement.

         9.7 Entire Agreement; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. This Merger Agreement
(including any exhibits hereto), the Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated November 20, 2001, between Purchaser and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both
written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         9.8 Severability. The provisions of this Merger Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Merger Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Merger Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

         9.9 Interpretation. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Merger Agreement
and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof. Where a reference in this Merger Agreement is made to a Section, such
reference shall be to a Section of this Merger Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Merger Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event
all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
