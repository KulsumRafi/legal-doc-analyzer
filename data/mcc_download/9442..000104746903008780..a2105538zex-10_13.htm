contain everything currently in existence, as well as the movables which, by accession thereto are reputed to be real estate, and the movables which, by benefit, use and cultivation of said real
estate, are permanently designed for them, even if they can be separated without damage; and also all increases and improvements to be made from now on, and the new works and constructions to be
erected, without reservations or limitations of any type; and the indemnity owed by the insurers of said assets. In addition, MARINES C.A. declares that certain assets mortgaged under this instrument
are only identified by their Land Registration Code, as appears from the certificates issued by the corresponding registries of property, and that their boundaries and dimensions have not been
reproduced in this instrument, but concerning which it declares that it is its will to include in the mortgage guarantee the entire property so identified, as well as the movables, reputed real estate
by accession and the movables which, by benefit, use and cultivation of said properties are permanently designed for them, even if they can be separated without damage; and also all the increases and
improvements received from now on and the new works and constructions to be erected, without reservations or limitations of any type. </FONT></P>

MARINES C.A. declares that, should the Land Register Codes which identify certain assets be changed currently, such changes will be deemed incorporated in this instrument,
