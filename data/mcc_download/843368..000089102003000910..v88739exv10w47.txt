         2.2      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at least one (1) but not more than two (2) Business Days prior to the

company membership interests and any other ownership interests in the LLC (the
"LLC INTEREST"), total cash consideration of Three Million, Four Hundred Ninety
Four Thousand Dollars

<PAGE>

($3,494,000.00) (the "PURCHASE PRICE"), of which (a) Three Million Two Hundred
Thirty One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($3,231,950.00), subject to
adjustment as provided in SECTIONS 3.4 AND 3.5, will be paid to Seller on the
Closing Date (as adjusted, the "BASE PURCHASE PRICE") and (b) Two Hundred Sixty
Two Thousand and Fifty Dollars ($262,050.00) (the "HOLDBACK") will be deposited
in an escrow account, and Seller will convey the LLC Interest to Buyer free and
clear of any Encumbrances, other than any transfer restrictions applicable under
state or federal securities laws, and Northland Communications Corporation, as
Manager of the LLC, shall consent to the transfer of the LLC Interest to Buyer,
all pursuant to the form of Assignment and Consent attached hereto as EXHIBIT E.
The Base Purchase Price and the Holdback will be paid or deposited by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

         3.2      THE HOLDBACK

         The Holdback will be paid at Closing and will be held in a one (1) year
escrow by U.S. Bank NA, as escrow agent ("ESCROW AGENT"), and will be payable to
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement to be entered into between Buyer, Seller and Escrow Agent as of
Closing, in the form set forth in EXHIBIT G (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"). The Escrow
Agreement shall set forth the agreement of Buyer and Seller to, among other
things, (a) appoint Escrow Agent to act as the escrow agent, (b) maintain a fund
for the payment of Seller's post-closing indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, (c) authorize the Escrow Agent to release to Seller, one (1) year
after the Closing Date (the "DISTRIBUTION DATE") the difference, if any, between
(i) the balance of the Holdback Amount (including any interest accrued thereon)
remaining after all indemnification payments to be paid to Buyer under this
Agreement have been paid and (ii) the aggregate amount of the then outstanding
claims of Buyer timely made and properly asserted under this Agreement and (d)
authorize the Escrow Agent to continue to hold the remaining balance of the
Holdback Amount (including any interest accrued thereon), if any, until it
receives a final, unappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or
joint written instructions of Seller and Buyer regarding disposition of the
remaining balance of the Holdback Amount (including any interest accrued
thereon).

         3.3      ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE

                  3.3.1    The Base Purchase Price, and correspondingly the
Purchase Price, will be reduced by an amount equal to Two Thousand Fifty-six
Dollars ($2,056.00) for every Equivalent Basic Subscriber below 1,680 as of the
Closing Time, subject to the provisions of SECTION 9.2.3 below.

                  3.3.2    If Buyer has not Closed within two (2) Business Days
after the date that is one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Transfer
Request Filing Deadline (the "Increased Purchase Price Deadline"), then the Base
Purchase Price, and correspondingly the Purchase Price, will be increased by an
amount equal to $2,056 multiplied by the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate
number of System EBSs as of the Closing Time over (b) 1,720.

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Purchase Price be increased
by the adjustments described in this SECTION 3.3.2 by more than $50,000.00.

                  3.3.3    The Purchase Price will be adjusted on a pro rata
basis as of the Closing Time for all prepaid expenses, excluding inventory (but
only to the extent the full benefit of such prepaid expenses will be realizable
by Buyer within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date), accrued expenses
(including real and personal property taxes), prepaid income, accounts payable
and subscriber prepayments and accounts receivable related to the Business, all
as determined in accordance with this Agreement and GAAP consistently applied,
and to reflect the principle that all expenses and income attributable to the
Business for the period prior to the Closing Time are for the account of Seller,
and all expenses and income attributable to the Business for the period after
the Closing Time are for the account of Buyer. Seller shall be entitled to an
amount equal to (i) 100% of the face amount of all accounts for EBSs receivable
that are thirty (30) or fewer days past due as of the Closing Time, (ii) 90% of
the face amount of all accounts receivable for EBSs that are more than thirty
(30) days but sixty (60) days or fewer past due as of the Closing Time, and
(iii) 0% for any accounts receivable for EBSs that are more than sixty (60) days
past due as of the Closing Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment
shall be made for any account receivable identified in SCHEDULE 5.17 below or
for any item of income or expense allocable to any Excluded Asset. Adjustments
may also be made as provided in SECTION 7.3.

                  3.3.4    To the extent such payments or deposits are not
actually contributed to the LLC, all obligations arising out of advance payments
to or relating to funds of third parties on deposit with, Seller as of the
Closing Time (including any accrued interest on such payments and deposits),
relating to the Business, including advance payments and deposits by subscribers
served by the Business for converters, encoders, decoders, cable television
service and related sales, will be assumed by the LLC to the extent that the
Purchase Price is reduced.

         3.4      DETERMINATION OF ADJUSTMENTS

         Preliminary and final adjustments to the Purchase Price will be
         determined as follows:

                  3.4.1    Not later than a date Seller reasonably believes is
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to
Buyer a report (the "PRELIMINARY ADJUSTMENTS REPORT"), certified as to
completeness and accuracy by the general partner of Seller or Seller's chief
financial officer (in his or her official but not personal capacity), showing in
detail the preliminary determination of the adjustments referred to in SECTION
3.3, which are calculated as of the Closing Time (or as of any other date agreed
by the parties) and any documents substantiating the adjustments proposed in the
Preliminary Adjustments Report. The Preliminary Adjustments Report will include
a complete list of subscribers, a detailed calculation of the number of
Equivalent Basic Subscribers and a schedule setting forth advance payments and
deposits made to or by Seller, as well as accounts receivable information with
relevant aging information relating to the Business (showing sums due and their
respective aging as of the Closing Time). Seller also will furnish to Buyer its
billing

<PAGE>

report for the most current period as of the Closing Date. Following receipt of
such schedule, Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days to review such schedule
and supporting information and to notify Seller of any disagreements with
Seller's estimates. If Buyer provides a notice of disagreement with Seller's
estimates of the adjustments referred to in SECTION 3.3 within such five (5)
Business Day period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any such dispute and to reach an agreement prior to the Closing Date on such
estimated adjustments as of the Closing Time. The estimate so agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller or (if Buyer fails to provide a notice of disagreement with
Seller's estimates of such adjustments within the time provided) the estimates
of such adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Adjustments Report shall be the
basis for determining the Base Purchase Price. If the parties are unable to
agree upon the appropriate calculations for the Base Purchase Price, the Base
Purchase Price shall be determined by an independent accounting firm acceptable
to both parties whose determination will be conclusive until the preparation of
the Final Adjustments Report; provided, however, any amount in dispute shall be
deposited in a mutually acceptable escrow account and Closing shall not be
delayed pending resolution of the dispute by the accounting firm. If the parties
cannot agree on an acceptable accounting firm within ten (10) days after the
parties have determined that a dispute exists the parties agree to use Sweeney
Conrad, P.S. Seller and Buyer will bear equally the fees and expenses payable to
such firm in connection with such determination.

                  3.4.2    Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer will
deliver to Seller a report (the "FINAL ADJUSTMENTS REPORT"), similarly certified
as to completeness and accuracy by Buyer, showing in detail the final
determination of all adjustments which were not calculated as of the Closing
Time and containing any corrections to the Preliminary Adjustments Report,
together with any documents substantiating the adjustments proposed in the Final
Adjustments Report. Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access to all
records which Seller has in its possession and which are necessary for Buyer to
prepare the Final Adjustments Report.

                  3.4.3    Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final
Adjustments Report, Seller will give Buyer written notice of Seller's
objections, if any, to the Final Adjustments Report. If Seller makes any such
objection, the parties will agree on the amount, if any, which is not in dispute
within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of Seller's notice of objections
to the Final Adjustments Report ("SELLER'S OBJECTION NOTICE"). Any undisputed
amounts resulting in a net payment to Buyer will be paid by Seller within three
(3) Business Days; provided, however, Buyer may, at Buyer's option, receive
funds from the Holdback, to satisfy all or any portion of any obligation of
Seller hereunder. Any remaining deficiency in such net payment shall be
satisfied by Seller. Any undisputed amounts resulting in a net payment to Seller
will be paid to Seller within three (3) Business Days. Any disputed amounts will
be determined within ten (10) Business Days following Buyer's receipt of
Seller's Objection Notice by an independent accounting firm acceptable to both
parties whose determination will be conclusive. If the parties cannot agree on
an acceptable accounting firm within three (3) days after the parties have
determined that a dispute exists, the parties agree to use Sweeney Conrad, P.S.
Seller and Buyer will bear equally the fees and expenses payable to such firm in
connection with such determination. The payment required after

<PAGE>

determination of all disputed amounts will be made by the responsible party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the other party within three (3)
Business Days after the final determination; provided, however, Buyer may, at
Buyer's option, receive funds from the Holdback to satisfy all or any portion of
any obligation of Seller hereunder.

         3.5      SELLER LIQUIDATION

         Seller shall not liquidate all or substantially all its assets prior to
the earlier of (i) Buyer and Seller agreeing upon all aspects of the Final
Adjustments Report and, if any payment is due from Seller pursuant to SECTION
3.4 based on the Final Adjustments Report, the final payment owed by Seller
having been received in full by Buyer or (ii) Seller paying the undisputed
amount owed by Seller to Buyer following delivery of Seller's Objection Notice
and depositing into the Holdback additional funds equal to the disputed amount
together with an amount reasonably sufficient to pay for Seller's share of the
cost of resolving the issues raised by Seller's Objection Notice (the
"ADJUSTMENT DEPOSIT"), which funds shall be held in the Holdback pending
resolution of issues raised by Seller's Objection Notice and the portion of the
Adjustment Deposit payable to Buyer, if any, following resolution of all
disputes concerning the Final Adjustment Amount shall be immediately paid to
Buyer and the balance of the Adjustment Deposit, if any, immediately paid to the
Seller. Without in any way extending the time periods specified in SECTION
3.4.3, Buyer agrees, upon written notice from Seller (the "LIQUIDATION NOTICE")
setting forth Seller's good faith belief of a possible liquidation of Seller
within fifty (50) days of Closing, to accelerate production and delivery of the
Final Adjustments Report within the later of thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date or ten (10) days after Seller's delivery of the Liquidation Notice,
provided adequate records are available at that time to complete the Final
Adjustments Report. Seller shall notify Buyer of any distribution of any assets
prior to the parties agreeing upon the Final Adjustments Report that may result
in Seller being unable to satisfy in a timely manner any obligations under
SECTION 3.4 without recourse to the Holdback. Each party's obligations and
covenants under this SECTION 3.5 shall survive Closing.

         3.6      ALLOCATION OF CONSIDERATION

         The Purchase Price shall be allocated as follows:

                  LLC Interest    Purchase Price, as adjusted, less $23,500.00

                  Non-Competition Agreement                         $23,500.00

For federal tax purposes, within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Buyer will deliver to Seller a draft schedule of values for the Assets and the
corresponding proposed allocation of the LLC Interest portion of the Purchase
Price. Thereafter, Seller shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon prior to Buyer and the LLC adopting the proposed allocation. Seller and
Buyer agree to work in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding Buyer's
proposed allocation. The parties agree to be bound by the allocation set forth
herein and the allocation proposed by Buyer for federal tax purposes after

<PAGE>

Closing, unless Seller provides a timely written objection to Buyer's proposed
allocation, which objection must be received by Buyer within thirty (30) days
after Seller's receipt of Buyer's proposed allocation. If Seller does timely
object, any disagreement regarding the proposed allocation that cannot be
resolved by Buyer and Seller within thirty (30) days shall be resolved pursuant
to the process described in SECTION 3.4.3. Neither Seller nor Buyer will take
any position inconsistent with any such allocations and will file all returns
and reports with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including all federal, state and local tax returns, on the basis of such
allocations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the Title Policies,
a value mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller reflecting actual current fair
market value shall be allocated to the Real Property within thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement.

4.       ASSUMED LIABILITIES, EXCLUDED ASSETS AND ADVERTISING ASSETS

                  5.7.2    The documents made available by Seller to Buyer as
evidence of each lease of Real Property constitute the entire agreement with the
landlord in question. To the knowledge of Seller, there are no leases or other
agreements, oral or written, granting to any Person other than Seller the right

Encumbrances affecting all or part of such parcel and (d) is available for
immediate use in the conduct of the Business or operation of the System, subject

dishes and related facilities used in the operation of the System are located
entirely on the Real Property and are maintained, placed and located in
accordance with the provisions of all applicable Legal Requirements, deeds,
leases, licenses, permits or other legally enforceable arrangements. There are
no pending condemnation, expropriation, eminent domain or similar proceedings of
which Seller has received notice or has knowledge affecting, in any material
respect, all or any portion of the Real Property. Seller has performed all
obligations under the leases; Seller is not in breach or default under any such
leases; there exists no condition or event which, after the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute such breach or default; and all payments
required to be paid under each of the leases have been paid in a timely manner.

                  5.7.4    All fee interests in all of the Real Property will be
conveyed to the LLC as of the Contribution Date by statutory warranty deed in
the form set forth in EXHIBIT B.

4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or any plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, whether to the plan, any participant
or beneficiary of such plan, any Governmental Authority or any other Person or
entity, as a result of Seller's participation in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. As of the Closing Date, the assets of each such Seller's Plan
are sufficient to provide all "benefit liabilities," as defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA, due under such Seller's Plan upon termination of such
Seller's Plan. None of Seller, any ERISA Affiliate or any other Person to which
any of them is a successor or parent corporation (within the meaning of Section
4069(b) of ERISA) has engaged in a transaction that could reasonably be expected
to result in, nor will the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents result in, a liability to Seller, any
ERISA Affiliate, Buyer or the LLC under Section 4069 of ERISA.

consent, approval or authorization of, or any filing with or notice to, any
Person; or (d) (i) violate, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default
under (without regard to requirements of notice, passage of time or elections of
any Person), (ii) permit or result in the termination, suspension, modification
of, (iii) result in the acceleration of (or give any Person the right to
accelerate) the performance of Buyer under any instrument or agreement to which
Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its assets is bound, or (iv) result
in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance, except for purposes of this
clause (d) such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
suspensions, modifications and accelerations as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Buyer or on the validity,
binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement or that are provided for or
anticipated by this Agreement or that arise out of Buyer's financing of the
Purchase Price at Closing.

         6.4      FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF BUYER

         Provided Buyer obtains the contemplated debt and equity financing for
the transaction described herein and in the NCP7 and NCT Agreements and Buyer
does not exercise its termination right under SECTION 10.1.7, Buyer will have
available on the Closing Date sufficient funds to enable it to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and perform its obligations hereunder,
including payment of the Purchase Price.

         6.5      FINDERS AND BROKERS

         Buyer has not employed any financial advisor, broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any financial advisory, brokerage, finder's or
similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for which Seller could be liable.

7.       ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

         7.1      ACCESS TO PREMISES AND RECORDS

         Between the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Seller will give Buyer and its counsel, accountants and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all the premises and Books and Records of the
Business and to all the Assets and the personnel engaged in the management or
operations of the System; and will furnish to Buyer and its representatives all
such documents, financial information and other information regarding the
Business and Assets as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request provided
that no investigation by Buyer will affect or limit the scope of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities of Seller in this
Agreement or in any Transaction Document or Seller's liability for breach of any
of the foregoing. Such information shall include, without limitation, all
monthly and quarterly revenue reports from the billing system provider that are
currently provided in the ordinary course of operations.

<PAGE>

         7.2      CONTINUITY AND MAINTENANCE OF OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         Except as Buyer may otherwise agree in writing, until the Closing:

                  7.2.1    Seller will continue to operate the Business only in
the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent with past practices, including
making ordinary marketing, advertising and promotional expenditures and, to the
extent consistent with such conduct and operation; using commercially reasonable
efforts to: (A) preserve the current business intact in all material respects,

its ordinary course of business at not less than normal historical levels
consistent with past practices, will maintain insurance as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and will keep all of its business books, records and files in
the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practices. Seller will
not itself, and will not permit any of its officers, directors, shareholders,
partners, agents or employees to, pay or forgive any of Seller's subscriber
accounts receivable (other than for their own residences) prior to the Closing
Date. Seller will continue to implement its procedures for disconnection and
discontinuance of service to subscribers whose accounts are delinquent in
accordance with those in effect on the date of this Agreement and consistent
with past practice. Seller will not except in the ordinary course of business or
to fulfill legal obligations engage in any hiring or employee compensation
practices except for changes in such practices implemented by Seller and its
Affiliates on a company-wide basis.

                  7.2.2    Seller will not, without the prior written consent of
Buyer: (a) modify, terminate, renew, suspend, abrogate or enter into any Seller
Contract, Governmental Permit or other instrument that would be included in the
Assets other than in the ordinary course of business, provided that Buyer's
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, will be required to modify,
terminate, renew, suspend, abrogate or enter into any retransmission consent or
programming contract, any franchise, any lease or any other agreement that
contemplates payments in any twelve (12) month period exceeding $5,000
individually or $50,000 in the aggregate; (b) engage in any hiring or employee
compensation practices with respect to the System, Business or any System
Employees that are inconsistent with past practices; (c) add or delete any
program services except to the extent required under the Cable Act or any other
Legal Requirement or change the rate charged for any subscriber service in a
manner that is outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with
Seller's prior practice;; (d) file a Cost of Service Election with respect to
any of the Systems;

<PAGE>

(e) sell, transfer or assign any of the Assets other than in ordinary course of
business and except for assets sold or disposed of and replaced by other assets

contract or commitment or incur any indebtedness or other liability or
obligation of any kind relating to the System or the Business involving an

expiring prior to Closing or can be terminated upon thirty (30) days' notice
without liability to Seller, Buyer or the LLC; (h) enter into any agreement with
a billing service with respect to the System of Business; (i) With respect to
the System and Business, engage in any marketing, subscriber installation,
collection or disconnection practices outside the ordinary course or
inconsistent with past practices; (j) except as in the ordinary course of
business consistent with normal salary reviews, increase the rate of
compensation or benefits payable or to become payable to any System Employees or
make any material change in personnel policies; or (k) take or omit to take any
action that would cause Seller to be in breach of any of its representations or
warranties in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer's consent
is requested for any proposed new or amended retransmission consent agreement
and Buyer does not object to the terms of the proposed new or amended agreement
within five (5) Business Days after receiving Seller's written notice of the
proposed terms, Buyer shall be deemed to have consented to the new or amended
terms provided they are, in Seller's reasonable judgment, not commercially
unreasonable or outside customary industry practice and convention.

                  7.2.3    Seller will deliver to Buyer correct and complete
copies of (a) monthly and quarterly financial statements and operating reports
for the Business and any reports with respect to the operations of a System
prepared by or for Seller and (b) all rate regulation documents at any time
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing. All financial statements so
delivered will be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with
the Financial Statements.

                  7.2.4    Seller will cause its appropriate Affiliates to be
bound by and comply with the provisions of this SECTION 7.2 to the extent such
Affiliates own, operate or manage any of the Assets or the System.

                  7.2.5    Except as contemplated hereby, Seller will not and
will not cause or permit the LLC to, (i) issue, deliver or sell or agree to
issue, deliver or sell to any Person any additional membership interests in, or
rights of any kind to acquire any ownership interest in the LLC of any class, or
any option, rights or warrants to acquire, or securities convertible into,
shares of capital stock or ownership interests or any stock appreciation rights
or similar rights, (ii) without the prior written consent of Buyer, amend the
Certificate of Formation or operating agreement of the LLC; (iii) with respect
to the Business or System, acquire, lease or dispose of or agree to acquire,
lease or dispose of any capital assets or any other assets, other than any
acquisition, lease or disposition that is (A) individually or in the aggregate,
immaterial in amount; (B) occurs in the ordinary course of business; or (C) is
outside the

<PAGE>

ordinary course of business but is consented to by Buyer; (iv), with respect to
the System, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial equity interest in, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof; or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing.

                  7.2.6    Except as provided in SECTION 7.3, Seller will not,
with respect to any System Employee, except as required to comply with
applicable law or existing contracts or plans, (i) adopt or terminate or amend
any bonus, profit sharing, compensation, severance, termination, stock option,
stock appreciation rights, pension, retirement, deferred compensation,
employment plan, agreement, trust, fund or other arrangement for the benefit or
welfare of any director, officer or current or former employee (except for such
awards made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
unless such award is otherwise prohibited under SECTION 7.3), (ii) increase or
decrease in any manner the compensation or fringe benefit of any director,
officer or employee (except for normal increases in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), (iii) grant any awards under any bonus,
incentive, performance or other compensation plan or arrangement (except for
such awards made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice unless such award is otherwise prohibited under SECTION 7.3), (iv) take
any action to fund or in any other way secure the payment of compensation or
benefits under any employee plan, agreement, contract or arrangement (except for
such actions made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice) or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing;.

                  7.2.7    Seller will establish and organize the LLC in the
State of Washington as provided in SECTION 2.1. Northland Communications
Corporation shall be and remain the sole manager of the LLC prior to Closing.
Seller shall not permit the LLC to engage in any business activity after the
Contribution Date and prior to the Closing other than the operation of the
Business in the ordinary course and shall not permit the LLC to incur any
obligations or liabilities other than the Assumed Liabilities. Seller will not
cause, permit or authorize the LLC to do or take any action that Seller would
not be authorized to do under this SECTION 7.2.

         7.3      EMPLOYEE MATTERS

                  7.3.1    Buyer may, but will have no obligation to, cause the
LLC to employ or offer employment to, any or all System Employees. Not less than
twenty (20) Business Days before the Closing Date, Buyer will provide notice to
Seller of which System Employees Buyer intends to hire directly or through the
LLC. Within thirty (30) days after the date of execution of this Agreement,
Seller will provide to Buyer a list of all System Employees by work location and
entity as of a recent date, showing the original hire date, the then-current
positions and rates of compensation, rate type (hourly or salary) and scheduled
hours per week, and whether the System Employee is subject to an employment
agreement, a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor
organization. The list will also indicate which of the System Employees Seller
desires to retain as Seller's employees (the "RETAINED EMPLOYEES"). The System
Employees that accept the LLC's offer of employment, which shall become
effective as of the Closing Time, shall be herein referred to as "TRANSFERRED

<PAGE>

EMPLOYEES." Seller agrees to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer to
allow Buyer or its Affiliates to evaluate the Systems Employees to make hiring
decisions; provided, however, other than with respect to Jerry Copperonol, John
Ulrich, Pete Grigorieff, Buyer shall not undertake any employment interviews
with any System Employees until thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing limitation, Buyer will have the
opportunity to make such appropriate prehire investigation of each System
Employee, as it deems necessary, including the right to review personnel files
(subject to Seller obtaining the consent of the System Employee) and, subject to
the foregoing restriction, the right to interview such System Employees during
normal working hours so long as such interviews are conducted after notice to
Seller and do not unreasonably interfere with Seller's operations and such
investigations and interviews do not violate any law or contract. Subject to
applicable law, Buyer, may, if it wishes, condition any offer of employment upon
the System Employee being in active service on the Closing Date, the System
Employee's passing a pre-employment physical examination (including drug
screening test) and the completion of a satisfactory background check. The Buyer
will bear the expense of such examination but Seller will, upon reasonable
notice, cooperate in the scheduling of such examinations so long as the
examinations do not unreasonably interfere with the Seller's operations. As of
the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor the LLC will have any obligation to Seller,
its Affiliates or employees, with regard to any employee Buyer has determined
not to hire. Seller agrees that as of the Closing Date, the only employees of
the LLC will be the System Employees to be hired by Buyer or the LLC.

                  7.3.2    As of the Closing, Seller shall terminate employment
of all Transferred Employees. Seller shall be responsible for providing any
notification that may be required under WARN and any similar statute with
respect to any Transferred Employees and otherwise complying with WARN or
similar state law requirements in connection with the termination of the
employment of any Transferred Employee by Seller. Seller shall be responsible
for and shall cause to be discharged and satisfied in full all amounts owed to
any System Employee on account of termination, including wages, salaries, any
employment, incentive, compensation or bonus agreements or other benefits or
payments. Buyer and Seller shall agree to make an adjustment to the Purchase
Price to reflect a credit to Buyer for the LLC granting Transferred Employees
accrued vacation pay and compensated personal leave in lieu of Seller's payment
of such obligations upon termination, such credit to be equal to the extent to
which Seller is relieved of an obligation to pay for such benefits. Seller
agrees that for a period of sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, it will not
induce or attempt to influence directly or indirectly any Transferred Employee
to terminate his/her employment with Buyer or LLC or to work for Seller or any
other person or entity.

                  7.3.3    Seller shall treat all employees (and their spouses
and dependants) who terminate employment with Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (regardless of whether the employee
becomes a Transferred Employee) as "qualified beneficiaries" entitled to
continuation health coverage as described in Section 4980B of the Code and
Section 601, et seq., of ERISA and shall continue to provide such continuation
coverage for the maximum period required by law to any former employee

<PAGE>

(and the spouse and dependants of any former employee) who is receiving (or
entitled to elect) such continuation coverage on the Closing Date.

                  7.3.4    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any employee or
his or her spouse, dependents, successors, assigns, heirs or legal
representatives, any rights or remedies hereunder, as a third-party beneficiary
or otherwise, including (i) any rights of employment for any specified period or
(ii) any employee benefits, severance or other compensation.

                  7.3.5    All claims and obligations under, pursuant to or in
connection with any welfare, medical, insurance, disability or other employee
benefit plans of Seller or arising under any Legal Requirement affecting
employees of Seller incurred on or before the Closing or resulting from or
arising from events or occurrences occurring or commencing on or before the
Closing will remain the responsibility of Seller, whether or not such employees
are hired by Buyer or the LLC as of or after the Closing. Neither Buyer nor the
LLC will have or assume any responsibility, obligation or liability under or in
connection with any Seller's Plan (and Seller shall retain all such
responsibilities, obligations and liabilities). For purposes of this Agreement,
the following claims and liabilities will be deemed to be incurred as follows:
(i) medical, dental and/or prescription drug benefits when the treatment is
provided, except with respect to such benefits provided in connection with a
continuous period of hospitalization, which will be deemed to be incurred at the
time of admission to the hospital; (ii) life, accidental death and dismemberment
and business travel accident insurance benefits and workers compensation
benefits, upon the death, disability or accident giving rise to such benefits;
and (iii) salary continuation or other short-term disability benefits, or
long-term disability, upon commencement of the disability giving rise to such
benefit.

                  7.3.8    Seller will remain solely responsible for, and will
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and LLC from and against all Losses arising
from or with respect to, all salaries, commissions, deferred compensation,
severance, insurance, pension, profit sharing, disability payment, medical, sick
pay, holiday, vacation (except for accrued vacation time included in the
calculation of adjustments), continuation coverage and other compensation or
benefits to which its employees may be entitled, whether or not such employees
may be hired by Buyer, as a result of their employment by Seller or the LLC on
or prior to the Closing, the termination of their employment on or prior to the
Closing, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or otherwise relating to their employment prior
to the Closing. Likewise, Seller will remain solely responsible for, and will
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and LLC from and against all Losses related,
directly or indirectly, to Seller's Plans. Any liability under WARN with regard
to any employee terminated on or prior to the Closing, or not hired by Buyer or
the LLC on or after the Closing, will, as a matter of contract between the
Parties, be the responsibility of Seller.

                  7.3.7    If Seller has, or acquires, a duty to bargain with
any labor organization, then Seller will (i) give prompt written notice of such
development to Buyer, including notice of the date and place of any negotiating
sessions as they are planned or contemplated and

<PAGE>

permit Buyer to have a representative present at all negotiating sessions with
such labor organization and at all meetings preparatory thereto (including
making Buyer's representative a representative of the Seller's delegation if
required by the labor organization) and (ii) not, without Buyer's written
consent, enter into any Contract with such labor organization that purports to
bind Buyer, the LLC or Seller after Closing, including any successor clause or
other clause that would have this purpose or effect. Seller acknowledges and
agrees that Buyer has not agreed to be bound or to have the LLC bound after
Closing, and will not be bound, without an explicit assumption of such liability
or responsibility by Buyer, by any provision of any collective bargaining
agreement or similar Contract with any labor organization to which Seller or the
LLC are or may become bound.

         7.4      REQUIRED CONSENTS AND FRANCHISE RENEWALS AND EXTENSIONS

                  7.4.1    Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as soon as possible and at its expense (except as provided below), all
the Required Consents, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
and will deliver to Buyer copies of such Required Consents promptly after they
are obtained; provided, however, that Seller will afford Buyer the opportunity
to review, approve and revise the form of Required Consent prior to delivery to
the party whose consent is sought. Buyer will cooperate with Seller to obtain
all Required Consents, but Buyer will not be required to agree to any adverse
changes in, or the imposition of any condition to the transfer to Buyer of, any
Seller Contract or Governmental Permit or other Asset as a condition to
obtaining any Required Consent. Buyer agrees to pay fifty percent (50%) of all
reasonable out of pocket third party charges or fees that may be incurred by
Seller to any Third Party in order to obtain the Required Consents ("CONSENT
FEES") that exceed $10,000 in the aggregate and that may required in connection
with the processing of any request for any Required Consent, up to a maximum
payment by Buyer hereunder of $20,000 ("BUYER'S CONSENT CONTRIBUTION").

                  7.4.2    Within eight (8) Business Days after the date hereof,
Buyer shall furnish Seller with such information as is necessary to permit
Seller to complete Section II of FCC Form 394 with respect to each franchise as
to which a Form 394 is required, which information shall include all of the
information required of the transferee/assignee by the franchising authority,
franchise agreement or applicable state and local law (the "BUYER 394
INFORMATION"). Within four (4) Business Days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's
information, Seller will complete, execute and file with each appropriate
Governmental Authority FCC Forms 394 with respect to each franchise as to which
such Form 394 is required and appropriate transfer consent request forms for all
other franchises (including without limitation the franchise for Shelter Bay),
together with all information required of the transferor/assignor by the
franchising authority, franchise agreement or applicable state and local law
(the "TRANSFER REQUEST FILING DEADLINE").

                  7.4.3    Seller will, upon the written request of Buyer (an
"EXTENSION REQUEST"), use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain renewals or
extensions for any System franchises named in such written request that will
expire within thirty-six (36) months from the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, the Stanwood and Island

<PAGE>

County franchise, such that the remaining term of all franchises required in
connection with the operation of the System will have a term of not less than
thirty-six (36) months on the Closing Date and there shall be no System
franchise for which a valid notice of renewal pursuant to the formal renewal
procedures established by Section 626 of the Cable Act has not been timely
delivered to the appropriate Governmental Authority (collectively, the
"FRANCHISE EXTENSIONS"). Buyer will cooperate with the Seller in efforts to
obtain the Franchise Extensions, but will not be required to accept or agree or
accede to any renewal or extended System franchise that contains terms that
would make or are reasonably likely to make the System franchise that is being
renewed or extended more onerous in any respect or that would reduce or are
reasonably likely to reduce the benefits available under the System franchise
that is being renewed or extended. Seller's failure to obtain renewal or
extension of any System Franchise shall not give rise to any right or remedy in
favor of Buyer, provided Seller has otherwise complied with this SECTION 7.4.3,
nor shall such failure result in any diminution of the Purchase Price.

         7.5      TITLE COMMITMENTS AND POLICIES

         After the execution of this Agreement, Seller will obtain, at its
expense, (a) within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
current commitments from a title insurance company reasonably acceptable to
Buyer (the "TITLE COMPANY") for owner's title insurance policies on the 1997
ALTA owner's form for all Real Property owned by Seller, and current leasehold
title policy commitments for lessee's title insurance policies for all Real
Property leased by Seller which is used for headend or tower sites (the "TITLE
POLICIES") and (b) as soon as practicable, surveys of each parcel of Real
Property containing such items as are necessary to obtain the Title Policies to
be issued pursuant to the title commitments provided by Seller (the "TITLE
COMMITMENTS") in the full amount of the Purchase Price allocated to such Real
Property with the standard printed exceptions relating to survey matters deleted
(the "SURVEYS"), certified to Buyer, the LLC and to the Title Company issuing a
Title Policy, and such affidavits, to the extent such affidavits are factually
accurate, as are required by the Title Company in order to delete the standard
printed exceptions relating to mechanics liens and the interests of other
parties in possession. If Buyer notifies Seller within five (5) Business Days
following its receipt of both the Title Commitments and Survey for all the Real
Property of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) or other matter
affecting title to Real Property which prevents access to or which could prevent
or impede in any way the use or operation of any parcel of Real Property for the
purposes for which it is currently used or operated by Seller (other than a
Permitted Encumbrance) (a "TITLE DEFECT"), then Seller will (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to remove such Title Defect or (ii) with the consent of the
objecting party, cause the Title Company to commit to insure over each such
Title Defect prior to the Closing. If such Title Defect cannot be removed prior
to Closing or the Title Company does not commit to insure over such Title Defect
prior to Closing and if Buyer elects to waive such Title Defect and proceed
towards consummation of the transaction in accordance with this Agreement in its
reasonable discretion, Buyer and Seller will enter into a written agreement at
Closing

<PAGE>

containing the commitment of Seller to use commercially reasonable efforts to
remedy the Title Defect following Closing on terms satisfactory to Buyer, in its
reasonable discretion. The cost of the Title Policies shall be paid by Seller on
or prior to the Closing Date.

         7.6      NO SHOPPING

         None of Seller, its Affiliates, shareholders, partners or officers or
any agent or representative of any of them will, during the period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and ending with the earlier to occur of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement, directly or indirectly (a) solicit or
initiate the submission of proposals or offers from any Person for, (b)
participate in any discussions pertaining to or (c) furnish any information to
any Person other than Buyer relating to, any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the Assets or (d) make information about the
System or the Business available to any Third Party in connection with the
possible sale of the System or Seller's Business or any ownership interests in
Seller or the LLC prior to the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that certain informational materials on the System prepared by
Seller's broker dated March 31, 2002 (the "BOOK") have already been distributed
to certain prospective buyers and, provided that no further distribution of the
Book or the materials or information contained therein takes place or is
authorized by Seller, its Affiliates, shareholders, partners, officers and
representatives, including Seller's broker, Seller shall not be in violation of
clause (d) of this SECTION 7.6. Seller shall cause its broker to notify in
writing all Persons who received or who have possession of the Book that an
agreement to purchase the Business has been signed but without identifying Buyer
or any transaction terms, and the form of such notice shall otherwise be
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

         7.7      NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS

         Seller will promptly notify Buyer of any fact, event, circumstance or
action (a) which, if known on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be disclosed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or (b) the
existence or occurrence of which would cause any of Seller's or Buyer's
representations or warranties under this Agreement not to be correct and
complete. Buyer will promptly notify Seller of any fact, event, circumstance or
action (a) which, if known on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be disclosed to Seller pursuant to this Agreement or (b) the
existence or occurrence of which would cause any of Buyer's or Seller's
representations or warranties under this Agreement not to be correct and
complete. Notwithstanding the communication of any such information shall not
limit in any way any representations or warranties made by the disclosing party
or any obligations or liabilities thereunder.

         7.8      RISK OF LOSS; CONDEMNATION

                  7.8.1    The risk of any loss or damage to the System
resulting from fire, theft or other casualty (except reasonable wear and tear)
will be borne by Seller at all times prior to Closing. If any such loss or
damage is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent

<PAGE>

resumption of normal operations of any material portion of the System or the
replacement or restoration of the lost or damaged property within twenty (20)
days or, if earlier, prior to the Closing Date, Seller will immediately notify
Buyer in writing of that fact and subject to the other provisions of this
SECTION 7.8, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to repair, replace
and restore the lost or damaged property to its former condition as soon as
practicable at its sole expense, subject to SECTION 7.8.2, including applying
any insurance proceeds to restore such assets to their prior condition.

                  7.8.2    If the aggregate cost to Seller to repair, replace or
restore the lost or damaged property to its former condition, exclusive of any
insurance policy or self insurance plan proceeds, would exceed $500,000 or if
the cost to Seller's Affiliates of repairing, replacing or restoring property
similarly lost or damaged by fire, theft or other casualty in the other
Northland Systems, when combined with the cost to Seller under this SECTION 7.8,
would exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, then, in either case, Seller may,
subject to Buyer's right to consummate the Closing as described below, elect to
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Buyer at any time within ten (10)
days of the occurrence of the event of loss or damage, and SECTION 10.2 shall be
applicable upon such termination.

                  7.8.3    If any such loss or damage to the System is
sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal
operations of a material portion of the System or the repair, replacement or
restoration of the lost or damaged property within twenty (20) days, or if
earlier, the Closing Date and Seller elects not to repair, replace and restore
the lost or damaged property, Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to Seller at any time within ten (10) days after it receives
written notice from Seller of the occurrence of the event of such loss or damage
and the fact that Seller is not obligated to correct the problem and has elected
not to correct the problem, and upon such termination SECTION 10.2 shall be
applicable. In the absence of a timely election to terminate this Agreement,
Buyer will be deemed to have waived such loss or damage and to have elected to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding Seller's
election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 7.8.2, Buyer may elect
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, in which event at the Closing
the amount of all insurance proceeds (except for proceeds related solely to
Excluded Assets) payable as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in
such loss or damage to the System (in each case to the extent not used to
repair, replace or restore such lost or damaged System), or, in the event the
loss was self-insured, the amount required to repair, replace or restore the
lost or damaged property (up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 in cooperative or
self insurance proceeds among Seller, NCP7 and NCT), except for any proceeds
from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for the
period through and including the Closing, will be delivered by Seller to Buyer
or the LLC or the rights to such proceeds will be assigned by Seller to Buyer if
not yet paid over to Buyer or the LLC, and, upon such delivery or assignment and
consummation of the Closing, Seller will have no additional liability to Buyer
in respect of any such loss or damage to the Systems.

<PAGE>

                  7.8.4    If, prior to the Closing, any part of or interest in
any material assets of the System is taken or condemned as a result of the
exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having
such power informs Seller that it intends to condemn all or any part of any
material Assets (such event being called, in either case, a "TAKING"), then
Buyer may terminate this Agreement. If Buyer does not elect to terminate this
Agreement, then (i) Buyer will have the sole right, in the name of Seller if
Buyer so elects to negotiate for, claim, contest and receive all damages with
respect to the Taking (except for damages related solely to Excluded Assets),
(ii) Seller will be relieved of its obligation to convey to Buyer the Assets or
interests that are the subject of the Taking, (iii) at the Closing, Seller will
assign to the LLC all of Seller's rights to all damages payable with respect to
the Taking (except for damages related solely to Excluded Assets), and (iv)
following the Contribution Date, Seller will give Buyer such further assurances
of such rights and assignment with respect to the Taking as Buyer may from time
to time reasonably request.

         7.9      LIEN AND JUDGMENT SEARCHES

         Seller will obtain, at its expense, within ten (10) days after the date
of this Agreement and again within ten (10) days prior to the Contribution Date,
(a) the results of a lien search conducted by a professional search company of
records in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Washington,
including copies of all financing statements or similar notices or filings (and
any continuation statements) discovered by such search company and (b) the
results of a search of the dockets of the clerk of each federal and state court
sitting in the city, county or other applicable political subdivision where the
principal office or any material assets of Seller may be located, with respect
to judgments, orders, writs or decrees against or affecting Seller or any of the
Assets.

         7.10     TRANSFER TAXES

         All Taxes arising from or payable by reason of the contribution of the
Assets to the LLC and the subsequent sale of all the membership interests in the
LLC to Buyer (the "SALES TAXES") will be paid equally by Seller and Buyer,
subject to Buyer's rights under SECTION 10.1.5. Tax returns required to be filed
in respect of Sales Taxes ("SALES TAX RETURNS") will be prepared and filed by
the party that has primary responsibility under applicable law for filing such
Sales Tax Returns. If no party has primary responsibility under applicable law
for filing a Sales Tax Return, then Seller will be responsible for preparing and
filing any such Sales Tax Return. Seller will comply with all state notification
requirements and timely file in proper form with any applicable taxing authority
any notice provided for under applicable state or local laws to confirm that tax
liabilities (other than Sales Taxes) of the Seller for the period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date will not be assumed by Buyer or the LLC. Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Contribution Date, a
written confirmation from the Department of Revenue of the State of Washington,
that all state Tax reports have been filed by Seller and all state Taxes (other
than Sales Taxes) and unemployment compensation contributions have been paid by
Seller through the date of Closing and a similar written confirmation from any
local taxing authority with respect to local Taxes (other than Sales Taxes) to
the extent available from such local

<PAGE>

taxing authority. Seller will also, within seven (7) Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, submit a written ruling request to the
Washington Department of Revenue in the Seller's name and in a form agreeable to
Buyer confirming that no Tax, including retail sales, use, or business and
occupation tax, will be owed by any of Buyer, Seller or the LLC in connection
with the contribution of the Assets to the LLC on the Contribution Date, the
subsequent sale of all or the membership interests in the LLC to Buyer, or the
LLC's use of the Assets after the contribution (the "REVENUE RULING"). After
submitting the request, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Revenue Ruling prior to the Contribution Date. If Seller obtains a
Revenue Ruling but the Revenue Ruling is denied or later determined to be
inapplicable with respect to the Sales Taxes for any reason other than a factual
misstatement, representation or omission in Seller's Revenue Ruling application,
Seller and Buyer shall pay equally all obligations arising out of or relating to
the Sales Taxes and any failure to pay or timely pay any Sales Taxes. If the
Revenue Ruling is later determined to be inapplicable due to a factual
misstatement, representation or omission in Seller's Revenue Ruling application,
Seller shall be fully responsible for all obligations arising out of or relating
to the Sales Taxes and any failure to pay or timely pay any Sales Taxes.

         7.11     UPDATED SCHEDULES

                  7.11.1   Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall have
the right for ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement to update
SCHEDULES 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4.2, 4.3, 5.4, 5.9.6, 5.9.7, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14.1,
5.14.2, 5.14.3, 5.15.1, 5.15.2, 5.17, 5.19, AND 7.12 to this Agreement (provided
that such update shall not be effective unless and until Buyer has received such
update), and that any and all such updated Schedules shall be dated as of the
date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be the Schedules for all purposes
of this Agreement (including for purposes of Seller's representations and
warranties and covenants in this Agreement). If Seller does submit an updated
Schedule, then the Due Diligence Deadline shall be extended by an additional day
for each day that passes after the date of this Agreement before Buyer received
the updated Schedule.

                  7.11.2   In addition, not less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Contribution Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer revised copies of
all Schedules updated and marked to show any changes occurring between the date
of this Agreement and the date of delivery; provided, however, that for purposes
of Seller's representations and warranties and covenants in this Agreement, all
references to the Schedules will mean the version of the Schedules attached to
this Agreement on the date of signing or the date on which they are provided
subsequently to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 7.11.1, and provided further that if
the effect of any such updates to Schedules is to disclose any one or more
additional properties, privileges, rights, interests or claims as Assets, Buyer,
at or before Closing, will have the right (to be exercised by written notice to
Seller) to cause any one or more of such items to be designated as and deemed to
constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes under this Agreement. Without
changing the result set forth in the preceding sentence that updated Schedules
do not serve to update representations and warranties of Seller, the updated
Schedules delivered pursuant to this Section will be accompanied by an officer's
certificate

<PAGE>

of Seller, certifying that the information set forth in such Schedules is true
and accurate in all material respects as of the date of delivery thereof and
that all information required to be given in the Schedules has been updated to
the date of delivery of the updated Schedules.

         7.12     USE OF SELLER'S NAME

         For a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer and the LLC may continue to use and operate the Systems using all of the
trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names, logos and similar
proprietary rights of Seller including the "Northland Cable Television" mark and
all derivations and abbreviations of such name and related marks ("SELLER
MARKS") currently in use by Seller, subject to and in accordance with the
guidelines attached hereto as SCHEDULE 7.12, which guidelines Buyer agrees to
fully comply with in the use of the Seller Marks. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer and the LLC shall be entitled to continue to use the Seller Marks, up to
an additional sixty (60) days beyond the initial one hundred twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date, provided Buyer and the LLC have been and are
continuing to use reasonable good faith efforts to transition the Business to
the use of marks owned by or license to the LLC and discontinue use of the
Seller Marks as soon as is commercially practical. Within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will discontinue using and will dispose
of all items of stationery, business cards and literature bearing the Seller
Marks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will not be required to remove or
discontinue using any such name or mark that is affixed to converters or other
items in or to be used in subscriber homes or properties, or as are used in a
similar fashion making such removal or discontinuation impracticable for Buyer
or the LLC.

         7.13     SUBSCRIBER BILLING SERVICES

         Seller will provide to Buyer in connection with the System for a period
of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, including access to
and the right to use its billing system computers, software and related fixed
assets ("TRANSITIONAL BILLING SERVICES"), in connection with the System acquired
by Buyer or the LLC to allow for conversion of existing billing arrangements.
Buyer will notify Seller at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing as
to whether it desires Transitional Billing Services from Seller. The
Transitional Billing Services shall be without cost to the LLC or Buyer for the
first sixty (60) days. After the first sixty (60) days, Buyer shall pay Seller
$0.40 per customer for Transitional Billing Services for the next thirty (30)
days and $0.50 per customer for each of the remaining three thirty (30) day
periods. In addition, Buyer will pay for reasonable out of pocket costs incurred
by Seller in facilitating the transition of billing services to the LLC or an
outside service retained by the LLC provided such reimbursable costs are for
extraordinary services and are approved in advance by Buyer.

         7.14     CERTAIN NOTICES

         Seller will duly and timely file a valid request for renewal under
Section 626 of the Cable Act with the proper Governmental Authority with respect
to all cable television

<PAGE>

franchises of the Business that will expire within thirty-six (36) months after
any date between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

         7.15     SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS

         Each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy, or
to cause to be satisfied, the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in
SECTION 9, provided that Buyer will not be required to agree to any increase in
the amount payable with respect to, or any modification that makes more
burdensome in any material respect, any of the Assumed Liabilities or, except as
may be otherwise specifically provided in SECTIONS 7.4.1, 7.10 AND 7.13 pay any
fees, costs or charges. If and to the extent Buyer has waived satisfaction of
any Required Consent that is a condition to Closing, subsequent to the Closing,
Seller will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain
in writing any Required Consent which was not obtained on or before the Closing
and will deliver copies of the same, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance, to Buyer. Seller shall, to the extent necessary, use the Base
Purchase Price proceeds received from Buyer at Closing to cause the release of
all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

         7.16     CONFIDENTIALITY

                  7.16.2   Neither party will issue any press release or make
any other public announcement or oral or written statement to its employees or
other Third Parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the consent of the other party. Each party will hold, and will
cause its employees, officers, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, the terms of this Agreement and any non-public information
concerning the other party obtained pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the preceding provisions, a party may disclose such information to the extent
required by any Legal Requirement (including disclosure requirements under
federal and state securities laws), but the party proposing to disclose such
information will first notify and consult with the other party concerning the
proposed disclosure, to the extent reasonably feasible. Also notwithstanding the
preceding provisions after the Due Diligence Deadline, Buyer and Seller shall
issue a joint statement informing the System Employees that a purchase agreement
has been entered into and that Buyer or the LLC anticipates retaining all or
substantially all of the System Employees after the Closing Date. Each party
also may disclose such information to employees, officers, consultants,
advisors, agents and actual or potential investors, owners or lenders whose
knowledge is necessary to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party's obligation to hold information in
confidence will be satisfied if it exercises the same care with respect to such
information as it would exercise to preserve the confidentiality of its own
similar information.

         7.17     COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

                  7.17.1   Except as permitted under SECTION 7.17.2, none of
Seller, any Principal or any Affiliate of Seller or any Principal will engage,
directly or indirectly, in any business

<PAGE>

that owns or operates a cable television business or broadband services in the
Service Area or the Service Areas described in the NCP7 Agreement or the NCT
Agreement (a "RESTRICTED BUSINESS"); except that this SECTION 7.17.1 will not
prohibit Seller or any Principal from acquiring or holding solely for investment
purposes 5% or less of any class or series of equity securities of any Person,
which class is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, even if that Person is principally engaged in a Restricted
Business.

                  7.17.2   The restrictions set forth in SECTION 7.17.1 will
terminate and have no further force or effect as of the second anniversary of
the Closing Date.

                  7.17.3   Seller acknowledges and agrees that any breach or
threatened breach of any of the obligations under this SECTION 7.17, would cause
immediate and irreparable harm to Buyer and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate relief. Without prejudice to other rights and remedies that may
be available to Buyer, Buyer will be entitled to obtain an injunction or other
equitable relief if Seller or any Principal breaches or threatens to breach any
of the terms of this SECTION 7.17, including temporary injunctive relief without
notice or opportunity to be heard and without the requirement for the posting of
a bond.

                  7.17.4   At the Closing, Seller and the Principals will, and
Seller will cause each of the Principals to, sign and deliver to Buyer and the
LLC a Noncompetition Agreement in the form of EXHIBIT I confirming the terms of
the covenant not to compete set forth in this SECTION 7.17 (the "NONCOMPETITION
AGREEMENT").

         7.18     RETENTION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS

         Following the Closing, Seller shall give access to Buyer, the LLC,
their counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives during normal
business hours to Seller's materials, books, records and documents which relate
to the operations of the Business with respect to the System prior to the
Closing Date as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any legitimate
purpose (including the preparation of tax reports and returns and the
preparation of financial statements). Such access will be subject to the
generally applicable document retention policies of Seller provided they are not
in conflict with any other provision of this Agreement, shall be subject to
reasonable advance written notice (not to exceed two (2) Business Days), will be
conducted in a manner that is not disruptive to Seller's business in any
material respect, and will be subject to any other reasonable limitations
imposed by Seller provided they do not deny the principal benefits of this
provision to Buyer or the LLC. Buyer and the LLC shall have the right to make
copies of such materials at their own expense.

         7.19     TAX MATTERS

                  7.19.1   If, with respect to any Tax, the taxable period does
not terminate on the Closing Date (a "SPLIT PERIOD"), then, unless the Tax is
otherwise allocated herein, the Tax (whether based on income, capital, ownership
of property or otherwise) attributable to the

<PAGE>

taxable period of the applicable entity that includes the Closing Date will be
allocated to (i) Seller for the period up to and including the Closing Date, and
(ii) the LLC for the period subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes of this
SECTION 7.19.1, Taxes for the period up to and including the Closing Date will
be determined on the basis of a closing of the books as of the Closing Date,
except that any such Tax imposed annually based on ownership of assets on a
particular date, or similar Tax will be prorated based on the assessment year
for the Tax for the period prior to and including the Closing Date and the
period thereafter.

                  7.19.2   Notwithstanding any limitations on liability
elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and the LLC on a first-dollar basis (i) for any and all Taxes for which
the LLC or the Buyer become liable with respect to taxable periods of Seller
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) all Taxes allocated to Seller
pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1. Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Seller with respect to all Taxes arising after the Closing Date allocated to the
LLC or Buyer pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1.

                  7.19.3   Seller will be solely responsible for and will
prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax returns
of Seller with respect to periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for
Seller after the Closing Date.

                  7.19.4   With respect to any Tax Return for a Split Period, if
the extended due date of such Tax Return is greater than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, the party preparing the return ("PREPARER") will deliver, at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax
Return (including extensions), to the party not preparing the return (the "OTHER
PARTY") a statement setting forth the amount of Taxes for which the Other Party
is responsible pursuant to this Agreement or that is allocable to the Other
Party pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1, as the case may be (the "STATEMENT"), and
copies of such Tax Return. The Other Party will have the right to review and
approve or disapprove such Tax Return and the Statement prior to the filing of
such Tax Return. Preparer and the Other Party agree to negotiate and resolve in
good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return and
the Statement and to mutually consent to the filing as promptly as possible of
such Tax Return. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute
within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of such Tax Return and the
Statement, Preparer and the Other Party will jointly select a public accounting
firm with nationally recognized tax expertise ("TAX ARBITRATOR") to resolve the
dispute. If the Tax Arbitrator has not resolved the dispute within five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the
Tax Return in question, then Preparer may file such Tax Return on the
determination having been made and without the Other Party's consent.
Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax Return, the Tax Arbitrator will make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue, and the amount of Taxes for
which the Other Party is responsible under this Agreement or that are allocable
to the Other Party pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1, as the case may be, will be as
determined by the Tax Arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator
will be shared equally by Preparer and the Other Party. Not later than (i) five
(5) Business Days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to
such Tax Return or (ii) in the event of a dispute, five (5) Business Days after
notice to the Other Party of resolution

<PAGE>

thereof, the Other Party will pay to Preparer an amount equal to the Taxes shown
on the Statement as being the responsibility of the Other Party under this
Agreement or allocable to the Other Party pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1, or in such
notice (as the case may be). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a
dispute, the Other Party will pay to Preparer not later than five (5) Business
Days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax
Return, the amount of Taxes that the Other Party reasonably believes at such
time is properly the responsibility of the Other Party under this Agreement or
allocable to the Other Party pursuant to SECTION 7.19.1. No payment pursuant to
this SECTION 7.19.1 will excuse the Other Party from its indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Agreement if the amount of Taxes as ultimately
determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns
that are the responsibility of the Other Party exceeds the amount of the Other
Party's payment under this SECTION 7.19.1.

                  7.19.5   Whenever any taxing authority sends a notice of an
audit, initiates an examination of Seller or the LLC or otherwise asserts a
claim, makes an assessment or disputes the amount of Taxes for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, Buyer will promptly inform Seller
and Seller will have the right to control (including control over whether and in
what manner to settle, compromise or abandon (in each case, to "VOLUNTARILY
DISCHARGE," and each such action a "VOLUNTARY DISCHARGE")), at its own cost, any
resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such
claim, assessment or dispute. Whenever any taxing authority sends a notice of an
audit, initiates an examination of the entity which operates the System or
otherwise asserts a claim, makes an assessment or disputes the amount of Taxes
for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, Seller will promptly
inform Buyer and Buyer will have the right to control (including control over
whether and in what manner to settle, compromise or abandon (in each case, to
"VOLUNTARILY DISCHARGE" and each such action a "VOLUNTARY DISCHARGE")), at its
own cost, any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle
any such claim, assessment or dispute.

                  7.19.6   Seller and Buyer will provide the other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing
authority, or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for
Taxes, and each will retain and provide the other with any records or
information which may be relevant to such return, audit or examination,
proceedings or determination. Such assistance will include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and will include providing copies
of any relevant tax return and supporting work schedules. The party requesting
assistance hereunder will reimburse the other for reasonable expenses incurred
in providing such assistance.

                  7.19.7   Buyer and Seller will cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding

<PAGE>

and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each
party agrees (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
each party will allow the other to take possession of such books and records.

         7.20     ADVERTISING SERVICES

         From and after the Closing Buyer shall cause the LLC to use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Excluded Advertising Receivables
for and on account of the Seller, applying the same collection efforts as
utilized by Buyer in the collection of the advertising receivables assigned to
the LLC hereunder; provided, however, neither Buyer nor the LLC shall be
obligated to incur any material out of pocket costs in attempting to collect the
Excluded Advertising Receivables. Buyer covenants to cause the LLC to utilize
Jerry Copperonol to manage such collection efforts so long as Mr. Copperonol is
employed by the LLC or one of its Affiliates. Buyer shall cause the LLC to
promptly remit to Seller the proceeds of any Excluded Advertising Receivables
received by Buyer (net of any collection costs). Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on a billing arrangement
incorporating commercially reasonable terms and fees, pursuant to which, for a
period of two (2) years following the Closing, the LLC will provide advertising
sales, billing and collection services for Seller's (or Seller's affiliate's)
cable television systems located in the Cities of Moses Lake and Othello,
Washington and Grant County, Washington.

         7.21     POST-CLOSING ARRANGEMENTS

         If Seller shall be unable to obtain a Required Consent prior to the
Closing, then, if Buyer so requests, Seller and Buyer will cooperate to enter
into a reasonable arrangement designed to enable Seller to perform its
obligations thereunder, and to provide for the assumption by Buyer of the
benefits, liabilities, risks and burdens (in each case to the extent an Assumed
Liability) of, any such Seller Contract or Governmental Permit, including
enforcement at the cost and for the account of Buyer of any and all rights of
Seller against the other party thereto arising out of the future cancellation
thereof after the Closing Date by such other party (a "POST-CLOSING CONSENT
ARRANGEMENT"). In addition, Seller shall be entitled to indemnification from
Buyer under SECTION 11.3 for any liabilities arising as a result of the failure
to obtain any Required Consent, to assign a Seller Contract or Governmental
Permit if Buyer agreed to close without the Seller having obtained such Required
Consent and the Required Consent was identified on Schedule 4. Seller shall
continue to use, for a period of at least six (6) months after the Closing Date,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent. As and when,
after the Closing Date, title to, interest in and rights under any such Seller
Contract or

<PAGE>

Governmental Permit becomes transferable, the assignment to the LLC by Seller of
any title to, interest in and rights under such Seller Contract or Governmental
Permit shall be deemed effective at the time such consent or approval is
effective, without any further action by Buyer, Seller or the LLC. Nothing in
this SECTION 7.21 shall be deemed to limit the LLC's obligations (to the extent
they are Assumed Liabilities) under any Seller Contract or Governmental Permit
assigned to the LLC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to limit or waive the requirements or benefits of any Closing
condition.

8.       CLOSING

         Unless the Agreement is earlier terminated prior to Closing as provided
in SECTION 10, the Contribution Date and the Closing Date will be held on the
dates specified by Buyer in a notice to Seller ("BUYER'S CLOSING NOTICE"). If
Buyer's Closing Notice is given prior to the Increase Price Closing Deadline,
Buyer may condition Buyer's Closing Notice and Buyer's obligation to close on
certain matters occurring or not occurring provided such matters are set forth
in Buyer's Closing Notice. Without the prior consent of Seller, the Closing Date
specified by Buyer in Buyer's Closing Notice shall not be a date less than three
(3) Business Days or more than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which
Seller receives Buyer's Closing Notice. The Closing will be held at 10:00 a.m.
local time at Seller's office located at 1201 Third Avenue, Suite 3600, Seattle,
Washington 98101, or will be conducted by mail or at such place and time as
Buyer and Seller may agree. If all of the closing conditions set forth in
Sections 9.1, 9.2 or 9.3 have not been waived or satisfied on the closing date
specified in Buyer's Closing Notice, the Closing shall be delayed until such
time as all of the closing conditions set forth in SECTIONS 9.1, 9.2 AND 9.3
have been satisfied or waived, subject to the termination rights of the parties
set forth in SECTION 10.1.

9.       CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

         9.1      CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER AND SELLER

         The obligations of each party to consummate the transactions

satisfaction or waiver in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
conditions:

                  9.1.1    No Legal Requirement has been enacted, promulgated or
issued or become or deemed applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any Governmental Authority, which would (a) prohibit Buyer's
ownership of the LLC or the LLC's ownership and operation of all or a material
portion of any System, the Business or the Assets or (b) prevent or make illegal
the consummation of any transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         9.2      CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER

         The obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to take place at the Closing are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver in writing, to

<PAGE>

the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, at or prior to the
Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:

                  9.2.1    All representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement and any Transaction Document shall be, if
specifically qualified by materiality, true in all respects and, if not so
qualified, shall be true in all material respects, in each case on and as of the
Closing Date with the same effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date.

                  9.2.2    Seller shall have performed and complied with each
obligation, agreement, covenant and condition required by this Agreement and in
any Transaction Document to be performed or complied with by Seller at or prior
to the Closing; provided, however, that Buyer shall be entitled to waive this
condition and proceed to Closing without also thereby waiving any right to
assert that Seller's failure to comply with its obligations in this Agreement
resulted in Buyer being obligated to pay an increase in the Purchase Price under
SECTION 3.3.2 and to be indemnified for such a failure to comply without the
application of Seller's Indemnification Threshold if and to the extent Buyer's
Closing Notice sets forth in reasonable detail Seller's alleged non-compliance.

                  9.2.3    The System shall have no less than 1,615 EBSs as of
the Closing Time; provided however that this condition shall be deemed waived if
Buyer, in its sole discretion, notifies Seller in writing that it will proceed
with Closing notwithstanding the number of EBSs and that there will be no
further downward adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to SECTION 3.3.1 for
any EBSs to the extent less than 1,615, unless there is a violation of the
certification made pursuant to SECTION 9.2.5(e)(iii).

                  9.2.4    Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not
have been any material adverse change in the Assets or the condition (financial
or otherwise) or operations of the Business or the System.

                  9.2.5    Seller, and each of the Principals where appropriate,
shall have executed (or caused to be executed) and delivered to Buyer at Closing
each of the following items:

                  (a)      Assignments, including an Assignment in the form of
         EXHIBIT E, and ownership certificates reasonably acceptable to Buyer

         Encumbrances.

                  (b)      Deeds, Bills of Sale, Assignments, Title

         LLC's rights in and to the Assets;

                  (c)      evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that all
         Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) affecting or
         encumbering the Assets have been terminated, released or waived, as
         appropriate, or original instruments in form

         reasonably satisfactory to Buyer effecting such terminations, releases
         or waivers together with the Title Policies, to be paid for by Seller;

                  (d)      an affidavit of Seller, under penalty of perjury,
         that Seller is not a "foreign person" (as defined in the Foreign
         Investment in Real Property Tax Act and applicable regulations) and
         that Buyer is not required to withhold any portion of the consideration
         payable under this Agreement under the provisions of such Act in the
         form attached as EXHIBIT F;

                  (e)      a certificate from Seller executed by an officer of
         Seller's General Partner, dated the Closing Date, (a) stating that, to
         his or her knowledge the condition specified in SECTION 9.2.1, 9.2.2,
         9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.2.6, 9.2.7, 9.2.8, 9.2.9 AND 9.2.12, has been
         satisfied; and (b) setting forth the total number of EBSs for the
         System, estimated in good faith as of the Closing Date;

                  (f)      all of the Books and Records, including a list of all
         pending subscriber hook-ups, disconnect and repair orders, supply

         System;

                  (g)      the Noncompetition Agreement in the form of

                  9.2.6    Seller shall have delivered to Buyer evidence, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to it, that all of the Required
Consents have been obtained or given and are in full force and effect without
the imposition of any condition or any modification that in either case makes or
is reasonably likely to make the underlying instrument materially more onerous
in any respect or materially reduces in any respect or is reasonably likely to
materially reduce in any respect the benefits available under the instrument in
respect of which the consent relates.

                  9.2.7    All required retransmission consents for continued
carriage of all broadcast signals carried on the system by the LLC shall have
been obtained on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable or deemed acceptable
to Buyer.

                  9.2.8    Each System franchise shall be in full force and
effect for the term set forth on SCHEDULE 2.

Agreement.

Buyer may waive in writing any and all of the conditions set forth in this
SECTION 9.2 hereof in whole or part.

         9.3      CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER

         The obligations of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to take place at the Closing are subject to the satisfaction
or waiver in writing by Seller, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at or
prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:

                  9.3.1    Buyer has paid the portion of the Base Purchase Price
required to be paid at the Closing, as adjusted in accordance with this
Agreement, and has delivered the Holdback to the Escrow Agent.

                  9.3.2    All representations and warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement shall be, if specifically qualified by materiality, true and
correct in all respects and, if not so qualified, shall be true and correct in
all material respects, in each case on and as of the Closing Date with the same
effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date, except for changes permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  9.3.3    Buyer shall have performed and complied with each
obligation, agreement, covenant and condition required by this Agreement to be

                  9.3.5    The System shall have no less than 1,615 EBSs as of
the Closing Time; provided however that this condition shall be deemed waived if
Buyer, in its sole discretion, notifies Seller in writing that it will proceed
with Closing notwithstanding the number of EBSs and that there will be no
further downward adjustments to the Purchase

<PAGE>

Price pursuant to SECTION 3.3.1 for any EBSs to the extent less than 1,615,
unless there is a violation of the certification made pursuant to SECTION
9.2.5(e)(iii).

                  9.3.6    All of the closing conditions to the obligations of

10.      TERMINATION

         10.1     EVENTS OF TERMINATION

         This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

                  10.1.1   by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

                  10.1.2   by either party, if the conditions to such party's
obligation to close as set forth in Section 9 have not been satisfied or waived
by such party in its sole discretion within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the date on which Seller has filed complete FCC Form 394 applications together
with all of the information required by the terms of the relevant franchise
agreement or applicable state and local law, for approval of all franchise
transfers for the Northland Systems (it being understood and agreed that any
delay resulting from the Seller's failure to provide all such information shall
correspondingly toll the running of such one hundred twenty (120) day period)
(the "CONSENT AND EXTENSION DEADLINE"); provided, however, either party may
extend the Consent and Extension Deadline an additional thirty (30) days during
which, time, to the extent necessary, each of Buyer and Seller agree to
negotiate in good faith towards a mutually satisfactory arrangement to address
any third party consent issues which provides for, among other things, Buyer
paying the full Purchase Price as described in SECTION 3, and taking title to
the LLC Interests on or prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period;

                  10.1.3   by either party as described in SECTION 7.8;

                  10.1.4   by Buyer in writing, if Seller has, or by Seller in
writing, if Buyer has, breached (i) any covenant or agreement contained herein,
or (ii) any representation or warranty contained herein, and in either case such
breach has not been cured by the earlier of thirty (30) days after the date on
which written notice of such breach is given to the party committing such breach
or the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice or cure
opportunity shall be required prior to termination if the breach is not
reasonably capable of being fully cured within thirty (30) days. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, a party may terminate this Agreement by virtue
of a breach by the other party of any

<PAGE>

representation or warranty contained herein only if the Losses incurred by the
non-breaching party as a result of the misrepresentations, breaches or
impairments result in or have a reasonable potential to result in Losses
(exclusive of Transaction Expenses) of at least $75,000 in the aggregate.

                  10.1.5   by Buyer if Seller fails or is unable to obtain the
Revenue Ruling within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement.

                  10.1.6   by Buyer if Buyer is not satisfied, in its sole
judgment and discretion, with the results of its investigation of the System and
the Business, provided Buyer must exercise its right under this SECTION 10.1.6
to terminate the Agreement within thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement as such period may be extended pursuant to SECTION 7.11.1 (the "DUE
DILIGENCE DEADLINE").

                  10.1.7   by Buyer if Buyer has not received commitments and
assurances from prospective lenders and equity investors that are, in Buyer's
reasonable judgment, sufficient to assure Buyer that funds will be available to
Buyer to pay the Purchase Price in full on the Closing Date; provided Buyer must
exercise its right under this SECTION 10.1.7 to terminate the Agreement no later
than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement (the "FINANCING
DEADLINE"). Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of the written commitment
received from Buyer's prospective primary equity investor and lender or lenders
(the "COMMITMENT LETTERS") within thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement.

                  10.1.8   by Seller if buyer has not delivered the Commitment
Letters within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement or if any
Commitment Letter delivered by Buyer contains conditions that are not
commercially standard and that result in Seller having a reasonable basis for
believing that there is a substantial risk of Buyer being unable to pay the
Purchase Price at Closing; provided, however, Seller may only exercise its
termination right under this SECTION 10.1.8 if (i) Seller has first notified
Buyer, in writing, no later than three (3) Business Days after receiving a copy
of the Commitment Letters of the specific concerns and conditions giving rise to
Seller's belief that there is a substantial risk of Buyer's loan and/or primary
equity financing not Closing; (ii) Buyer is unable, within ten (10) days
thereafter, to cure or otherwise address Seller's stated concerns to Seller's
reasonable satisfaction; and (iii) Seller affirmatively elects and notifies
Buyer, in writing, that it has elected to terminate this Agreement under this
SECTION 10.1.8 within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of Buyer's
cure period. The parties agree, without limiting the grounds under which Seller
can determine that there is a substantial risk that Buyer will be unable to pay
the Purchase Price, that any Commitment Letter which is either (a) contingent or
otherwise conditioned upon syndication or (b) based upon a "best efforts"
commitment to provide funding shall, in either case, presumptively constitute a
substantial risk of Buyer being unable to pay the Purchase Price at Closing.
Conversely, a condition in a Commitment Letter pertaining to the absence of a
material adverse change in the condition of the Business or Assets, including
without limitation a decline in revenues, shall not, by itself, constitute a
substantial risk of the Buyer being unable to pay the Purchase Price at Closing.

<PAGE>

                  10.1.9   by Buyer if, within thirty (30) days after the date
of this Agreement, Seller does not provide written assurances that are
reasonably acceptable to Buyer from Seller's lenders that the lenders consent to
the sale of the Systems and that the Base Purchase Price proceeds that will be
available to Seller on the Closing Date, after the payment of any and all other
obligations of Seller, will be sufficient to release and clear any and all
Encumbrances of the lenders and that such lenders will release any and all such
Encumbrances at Closing upon Seller's payment of such portion of the Base
Purchase Price to such lenders as specified in such written assurance; provided,
however, Buyer may only exercise its termination right under this SECTION 10.1.9
if (i) Buyer has first notified Seller, in writing, no later than three (3)
Business Days after receiving a copy of such written assurance of the specific
concerns and conditions giving rise to Buyer's belief that there is a
substantial risk of the Encumbrances not being released at Closing; (ii) Seller
is unable, within ten (10) days thereafter, to cure or otherwise address Buyer's
stated concerns to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction; and (iii) Buyer
affirmatively elects and notifies Seller, in writing, that it has elected to
terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 10.1.9 within five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of Seller's cure period. The parties agree, without
limiting the grounds under which Buyer can determine that there is a substantial
risk of the Encumbrances not being released, that any written assurances that do
not specifically confirm to Buyer that upon payment of a specific amount that is
less than the Base Purchase Price the Encumbrances will be released at closing
shall presumptively constitute a substantial risk of the Encumbrances not being
released at Closing.

                  10.1.10  by Buyer if Buyer's Consent Contribution obligations
will exceed $20,000 or by Seller if Seller's total obligation for Consent Fees
will exceed $30,000 unless Buyer agrees (which Buyer shall have no obligation to
do otherwise) to pay for any Consent Fees to be paid by Seller in excess of
$30,000.

                  10.1.11  by Buyer if there is a Title Defect that materially
impairs the value of the Real Property or Assets or has a material adverse
effect on the operation of the System that cannot be removed by Seller prior to
the Contribution Date.

         10.2     LIABILITIES IN EVENT OF TERMINATION

         If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to SECTION 10.1, all
obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto shall terminate, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement (including provisions regarding sharing of
expenses) and except for the obligations set forth in SECTIONS 7.16
(Confidentiality) and 12.14 (Expenses). Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing herein
shall release or release any party from any obligation or liability arising out
of any breach, default or misrepresentation giving rise to a right of
termination; provided, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated
for any such reason prior to Closing, the damages recoverable by the terminating
party shall be limited to out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with this transaction (the "Transaction Expenses"), but in no event
shall either party be obligated to pay consequential damages.

<PAGE>

         10.3     PROCEDURE UPON TERMINATION

         In the event of the termination of this Agreement by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to this SECTION 10, written notice of such termination will promptly be
given by the terminating party to the other.

11.      SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

         11.1     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller in this
Agreement and in the Transaction Documents and the covenants of Buyer and Seller
in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to be performed prior to the
Closing will survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "ONE
YEAR SURVIVAL PERIOD") except that (a) all such representations and warranties
with respect to Taxes, Environmental Laws, ERISA, employee benefits, employment
matters or copyright matters will survive until sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions)
for such Taxes, Environmental Laws, ERISA, employee benefits, employment matters
or copyright matters, respectively, and (b) the representations and warranties
as to title to the Assets and the LLC Interest in SECTION 5.4, and as to title
to Real Property set forth in SECTION 5.7, and in the statutory warranty deed or
deeds delivered with respect to Real Property will survive the Closing and the
delivery of such deeds and will continue in full force and effect without
limitation with the understanding that, notwithstanding any language contained
in any such deed, the representations and warranties as to title to Real
Property set forth in SECTION 5.7, respectively, will not be merged into any
such deed or other Transaction Document. The periods of survival of the
representations and warranties and of the covenants to be performed prior to the
Closing prescribed by this SECTION 11 are referred to as the "SURVIVAL PERIOD."
Subject to SECTIONS 11.2 AND 11.3, after the Closing Date the liabilities of
each party under its respective representations and warranties and its
respective covenants to be performed prior to the Closing will expire as of the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period; provided, however, that such
expiration will not include, extend or apply to any such representation or
warranty or covenant, the breach of which has been asserted by a party in a
written notice to the other party before such expiration or about which a party
has given the other party written notice before such expiration indicating that
facts or conditions exist that, with the passage of time or otherwise, can
reasonably be expected to result in a breach (and describing such potential
breach in reasonable detail). The covenants and agreements of each party in this
Agreement and in the Transaction Documents to be performed at or after the
Closing will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

of such Persons, from and against:

                  11.2.1   all Losses of or to Buyer or any such other
indemnified Person resulting from or arising out of (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document; (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Seller or

claim, action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party (collectively, an "ACTION")
as a result of any (i) act or omission of Seller or the LLC with respect to any
event or circumstance related to the ownership or operation of the System or the
conduct of the Business, which act, omission, event or circumstance occurred or
existed prior to or at the Closing, without regard to whether a claim with
respect to such matter is asserted before or after the Closing, including any
matter described on SCHEDULE 5.12 or (ii) breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or any Transaction Document; (d) the
failure by Seller to perform any of its obligations in respect of Retained
Liability; (e) any Title Defect relating to any of the Real Property that is not
deleted as an exception in, insured over by the applicable Title Policy or

seq., of ERISA with respect to former employees (or their spouses or dependants)

is deemed to be a successor employer of such party under Code Section 4980B or

ownership of such Real Property, without regard to whether a claim with respect
to such matter is asserted before or after the Closing; (j) any rate refund or
credit, penalty and/or interest payment with respect thereto ordered by any
Governmental Authority (including judgments in a private civil action) with
respect to the System for periods through and including the Closing; and (k) any
liability or obligation arising out of an Excluded Asset for which Buyer or the
LLC become or remain liable after Closing and for which a full adjustment was
not made at Closing; and

                  11.2.2   all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
judgments, assessments, fines, interest, penalties, costs and expenses
(including settlement costs and reasonable legal, accounting, experts' and other
fees, costs and expenses) incident or relating to or resulting from any of the
foregoing.

         11.3     INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER

         After Closing, Buyer and the LLC, jointly and severally, will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and Seller's partners and its and
their respective Affiliates, and the

<PAGE>

Seller is required to indemnify Buyer or the LLC; and

                  11.3.2   all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
judgments, assessments, fines, interest, penalties, costs and expenses
(including settlement costs and reasonable legal, accounting, experts' and other
fees, costs and expenses) incident or relating to or resulting from any of the
foregoing.

         11.4     LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITY

                  11.4.1   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no indemnification for Losses may be recovered from Seller under
SECTION 11.2 of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of such
indemnifiable Losses exceeds $26,500 ("SELLER'S INDEMNIFICATION THRESHOLD");
provided, however, Seller's Indemnification Threshold shall not be applicable
with respect to any of the following ("EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"): (a) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement that was
fraudulent or intentional, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or

incurred with respect to any breach of any representation or any warranty that
is specifically qualified by materiality or any value impairment qualified by
materiality or any adverse affect qualified by materiality, the
misrepresentation, breach, value impairment or adverse affect shall be
considered material and Seller's Indemnification Threshold satisfied if the
Losses to Buyer or the LLC as a result of the misrepresentation, breach,
impairment or affect are or may be at least $26,500; provided, however, that
with regard to any representation or warranty pertaining to compliance with any
Legal Requirement or Governmental Permit, the Losses must result from a Third
Party Action requesting correction or compliance costing Buyer or the LLC in the
aggregate at least $26,500, or Persons asserting claims against Buyer or the LLC
of at least $26,500 in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no indemnification for Losses may be recovered from
Buyer under SECTION 11.3 of this Agreement unless and until the amount of such
indemnifiable Losses for an indemnification claim exceeds $25,000 ("BUYER'S
INDEMNIFICATION THRESHOLD"); provided, however,

<PAGE>

Buyer's Indemnification Threshold shall not be applicable with respect to any of
the following: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in
this Agreement that was fraudulent or intentional; (b) Buyer's obligation to pay
any post-Closing adjustments pursuant to SECTION 3.3; or (c) any failure by the
LLC to assume and discharge the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the
Acceptance and Assumption signed by the LLC on the Contribution Date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any indemnification claim
exceed $26,500 in the case of claims against Seller and $25,000 in the case of
Buyer then, subject to the application of the Indemnification Ceiling, all
Losses, including those under the Indemnification Thresholds, shall be subject
to the indemnification obligations in this SECTION 11.4.1.

                  11.4.2   The aggregate amount of indemnification for Losses
which may be recovered from Seller under SECTION 11.2 or Buyer or the LLC under
SECTION 11.3 shall not exceed the amount of $262,050 (the "INDEMNIFICATION
CEILING") unless the Losses relate to (a) an Excluded Liability; (b) the
obligation to pay post-Closing adjustments pursuant to SECTION 3.3; (c) in the
case of the LLC, to the LLC's Assumed Liabilities; (d) in the case of Buyer, to
payment of the Holdback; (e) in the case of Seller, to any Loses pertaining to a
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant that is not subject to the One
Year Survival Period; (f) in the case of Seller, any failure to pay any Taxes

ERISA Affiliate to comply with any Environmental Laws, ERISA, or relating to any
Seller's Plans or any Losses arising out of any employment or copyright matters
pertaining to the period prior to Closing; and (g) in the case of Seller, any
breach or failure of any representation or warranty of title pertaining to any
of the Assets or the LLC Interest.

         11.5     THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

         Promptly after the receipt by any party of notice of any Action by any
Third Party, which Action is subject to indemnification under this Agreement,
such receiving party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") will give reasonable written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY"). The Indemnified Party will be entitled, at the sole expense and
liability of the Indemnifying Party, to exercise full control of the defense,
compromise or settlement of any such Action unless the Indemnifying Party,
within a reasonable time after the giving of such notice by the Indemnified
Party, (a) admits in writing to the Indemnified Party the Indemnifying Party's
liability to the Indemnified Party for such Action under the terms of this
SECTION 11, (b) notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying
Party's intention to assume such defense, (c) provides evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's ability to pay
the amount, if any, for which the Indemnified Party may be liable as a result of
such Action and (d) retains legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Action. The other party will
cooperate with the party assuming the defense, compromise or settlement of any
such Action in accordance with this Agreement in any manner that such party
reasonably may request. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any
such Action, the Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or
settlement of the

<PAGE>

Action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees
and expenses, (ii) any relief other than the payment of money damages is sought
against the Indemnified Party or (iii) the Indemnified Party will have been
advised by its counsel that there may be one or more defenses available to it
which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Party, and in any such case that portion of the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel that are reasonably related to matters covered by the indemnity
provided in this SECTION 11 will be paid by the Indemnifying Party. No
Indemnified Party will settle or compromise any such Action for which it is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying Party will settle or
compromise any such Action (A) in which any relief other than the payment of
money damages is sought against any Indemnified Party or (B) in the case of any
Action relating to the Indemnified Party's liability for any tax, if the effect
of such settlement would be an increase in the liability of the Indemnified
Party for the payment of any tax for any period beginning after the Closing
Date, unless the Indemnified Party consents in writing to such compromise or
settlement.

         11.6     PAYMENTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS

         Amounts payable by either party in respect of any amounts that are
subject to the indemnification obligations of such party under SECTION 11.2 OR
SECTION 11.3 will be payable by the Indemnifying Party within five (5) days of
receiving written notice of such losses from the Indemnified Party and will bear
interest at the rate per annum publicly announced from time to time by U.S. Bank
NA as its prime rate (the "PRIME RATE") plus 200 basis points from the date such
losses are determined. At the election of either party, Buyer may satisfy any
amounts owed to it by Seller under SECTION 11.2 out of the Holdback and the
Holdback will be reduced accordingly. Nothing in the preceding sentence will be
deemed a limitation on Seller's obligations under SECTION 11.2.

         11.7     EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

         Except as set forth in SECTION 12.15 and the Noncompetition Agreement,
after Closing, the indemnification rights of the parties as set forth under this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to claims resulting from any violation or breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement; provided, however, this
provision shall not limit or restrict Buyer or Seller's rights under the Escrow
Agreement or to the Holdback as provided in this Agreement.

12.      MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1     PARTIES OBLIGATED AND BENEFITED

Neither party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement or delegate any
of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party, provided that Buyer may, without the consent of any other party,
prior to Closing assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
to any Affiliate of Buyer or any entity in which Buyer or Steven Weed has an
equity interest.

         12.2     ATTORNEYS' FEES

         This Agreement or any of its provisions may not be waived except in
writing. The failure of any party to enforce any right arising under this
Agreement on one or more occasions will not operate as a waiver of that or any
other right on that or any other occasion.

         The article and section captions of this Agreement are for convenience
only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

party fully to enjoy and exercise the rights accorded and acquired by it under
this Agreement.

         12.8     TIME

         Time is of the essence under this Agreement. If the giving of any
notice or the performance of any act required or permitted under this Agreement
falls on a day which is

<PAGE>

not a Business Day, the time for the giving of such notice or the performance of
such act will be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

         12.9     LATE PAYMENTS

payment at the Prime Rate plus 200 basis points, adjusted as and when changes in
the Prime Rate are made.

         12.10    COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be
deemed an original.

         12.11    ENTIRE AGREEMENT

modified except by a writing signed by the parties.

         12.12    SEVERABILITY

         Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable will be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or

of the Person intended to be benefited by such provision or any other provisions
of this Agreement provided the basic economic bargain survives.

interpretation of this Agreement.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each party
will pay all of its expenses, including attorneys' and accountants' fees, in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         12.15    RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

         The parties acknowledge that the unique nature of the obligations under

either party of its

<PAGE>

the parties agree that in the event one of the parties refuses to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement when obligated to do so hereunder,
the other party shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance of this
Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller also acknowledge the unique nature of the
commitments made under SECTIONS 7.16 AND 3.5 renders money damages an inadequate
remedy for the breach of the obligations of the parties under this Agreement,
and the parties agree that in the event of such breach by one of the parties,
the other party will be entitled to a decree of specific performance of the
commitments set forth in SECTION 7.16 OR 3.5 as applicable. Nothing in this
SECTION 12.15 shall limit or restrict or be restricted by the rights or remedies
of the parties under SECTION 10.

         12.16    RIGHTS CUMULATIVE

         All rights and remedies of each of the parties under this Agreement
will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies will not
preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this
Agreement or applicable law.
