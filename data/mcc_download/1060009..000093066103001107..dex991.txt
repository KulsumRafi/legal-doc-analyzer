to 0.50% of such Lender's Commitment (as in effect on the opening of business on
the date of this Amendment).

     (d) Except as expressly set forth herein, the amendments contained herein
shall not constitute a waiver or amendment of any term or condition of the
Credit Agreement or any other Financing Document, and all such terms and
conditions shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
confirmed in all respects.
