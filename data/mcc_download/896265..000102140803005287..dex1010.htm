State. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America, in each case located in the State of Delaware, solely in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to
such action or proceeding will be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 11 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, will be valid and sufficient service thereof. </FONT></P><P

litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (<U>a</U>) no

costs and expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of the Indemnitee&#146;s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because such fees, costs and expenses would substantially detract from the benefits
intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder. Accordingly, without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, if it should appear to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitors have failed to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement or in the event that the Indemnitors or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to
recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnitors irrevocably authorize the Indemnitee from time to time to retain counsel of the Indemnitee&#146;s choice, at the expense of
the Indemnitors as hereafter provided, to advise and represent the Indemnitee in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense (including, without limitation, the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action),
whether by or against the Indemnitors or any director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Indemnitors, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Indemnitors and such
counsel, the Indemnitors irrevocably consent to the Indemnitee&#146;s entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel and, in connection therewith, the Parties agree that a confidential relationship will exist between the Indemnitee
and such counsel. Without respect to whether the Indemnitee prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Indemnitors will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneys&#146; and related fees and
expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any of the foregoing. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
