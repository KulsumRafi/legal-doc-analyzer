                                                                   -------------


                             REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

         This REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 27, 2002 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and between DSL.NET, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Obligor"), the guarantors identified on the signature pages hereof
(collectively, the "Guarantors" and each a "Guarantor") and VANTAGEPOINT VENTURE
PARTNERS III (Q), L.P., a Delaware limited partnership as the administrative
agent for the Guarantors ("Agent").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

         A.   Obligor has requested that the Guarantors cause to be issued, and
              subject to the terms and condition of this Agreement, the
              Guarantors have agreed to be issued, Guaranties (collectively, as
              amended and in effect from time to time, the "Guaranties" and each
              a "Guaranty") in an aggregate amount up to Six Million Seven
              Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars ($6,730,000) to support certain
              obligations of Obligor, under a Revolving Credit and Term Loan
              Agreement, dated as of December 13, 2002 (as amended and in effect
              from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), between Obligor and
              Fleet National Bank ("Bank").

         B.   In order to induce Guarantors to issue the Guaranties, Obligor has
              agreed to enter into this Agreement.

         C.   The obligations under this Agreement are secured by a Security
              Agreement, dated the date hereof, executed by Obligor and certain
              of its Subsidiaries in favor of Agent for itself and the benefit
              of the Guarantors (as amended and in effect from time to time, the
              "Security Agreement"). The obligations under this Agreement have
              been guarantied by certain of the Subsidiaries of Obligor (each a
              "Subsidiary Guarantor") pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty, dated
              as of the date hereof (as amended and in effect from time to time,
              the "Subsidiary Guaranty")

         D.   Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement
              shall have the respective meanings set forth in Section 6 hereof.


                                    AGREEMENT
                                    ---------

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Obligor hereby agrees with Guarantors and Agent as follows:

         1.   REIMBURSEMENT. (a) If Guarantors shall at any time or from time to
time be required to make any payment (i) under the Guaranties for any Drawn
Amounts, or (ii) in payment of a Guaranty Expense Amount, then Agent, at the
direction of Required Guarantors (provided, that if the Columbia Entities desire
to take an enforcement action that Required Guarantors have not consented to,
the Agent shall take such enforcement action as the Columbia Entities direct the
Agent to take, provided further, that Agent shall not take such enforcement
action until the earlier of (A) the 120th day after receipt by Agent of written
notice of such enforcement action from the Columbia Entities or (B) such time as
the Required Guarantors have provided their consent to such enforcement
actions), may give Obligor written notice of any such payments and Obligor shall
reimburse Agent within two (2) business days of receipt of such written notice
an amount equal to such Drawn Amounts and/or Guaranty Expense Amount, as
applicable.
<PAGE>
         (b)  Obligor's Obligations hereunder are absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and shall not be reduced by any set-off or any event or occurrence
including any action or inaction by Agent or Guarantors or any other party or by
any unenforceability of the Credit Agreement. Any Obligations not paid when due
shall bear interest a rate per annum of 10%.

         (c)  All payments by Obligor shall be made to Agent for the account of
all of the Guarantors and shall be made in immediately available funds, no later
than 1:00 p.m. (California time) on the date specified herein. Any payment
received by Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (California time), shall be deemed to
have been received on the following business day and any applicable interest
shall continue to accrue until such following business day.

         (d)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, aggregate payments
made pursuant to this Section 1 shall be apportioned ratably among the
Guarantors and payments of Guaranty Expense Amounts (other than fees or expenses
that are for Agent's separate account) shall be apportioned ratably among the
Guarantors. All payments shall be remitted to Agent and all such payments and
all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, shall be applied as follows:

                  (i) first, to pay any Guaranty Expense Amounts then due to
         Agent under the Operative Documents, until paid in full;

                  (ii) second, to pay any Guaranty Expense Amount then due to
         the Guarantors under the Operative Documents, on a ratable basis, until
         paid in full;

                  (iii) third, to pay any interest due in respect of Drawn
         Amounts to the Guarantors under this Agreement, on a ratable basis,
         until paid in full; and

                  (iv) fourth, to pay any Drawn Amounts then due to the
         Guarantors under this Agreement, on a ratable basis, until paid in
         full.

         Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, rights, interests and
obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and related Operative
Documents, including security interests in the Collateral under the Security
Agreement, shall be shared by each Guarantor in the ratio of (a) the aggregate
Drawn Amount paid by such Guarantor to Bank pursuant to such Guarantor's
Guaranty to (b) the aggregate Drawn Amounts paid by all Guarantors to Bank
pursuant to such Guarantors' Guaranties; and if no Drawn Amounts have been paid
to Bank, then the ratio of (y) a Guarantor's Guaranty Commitment to (z) the
aggregate Guaranty Commitments of all Guarantors. Any reference in this
Agreement to an allocation between or sharing by Guarantors of any right,
interest or obligation "ratably," "proportionally" or in similar terms shall
refer to this ratio.

         2.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OBLIGOR. Obligor represents and
warrants to Agent and Guarantors that:

then each Additional Guarantor, on the date of execution of its Guaranty, shall
be issued a warrant to purchase Obligor's common stock in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C. Each Additional Guarantor that is entitled to receive a

         7.   AGENT.

              (a) Appointment and Authorization of Agent. Each Guarantor hereby
designates and appoints VantagePoint Venture Partners III (Q), L. P. as its
representative under this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, or any successor Agent to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other
Operative Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other
Operative Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Agent agrees to act as representative of the Guarantors on the express
conditions contained in this Section 7 and as set forth in the Operative
Documents. The provisions of this Section 7 are solely for the benefit of Agent,
and the Guarantors, and Obligor shall have no rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein. Any provision to the
contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Operative
Document notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
except those expressly set forth herein or therein, nor shall Agent have or be
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Guarantor, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or any other Operative Document or otherwise exist
against Agent; it being expressly understood and agreed that the use of the word
"Agent" is for convenience only, that Agent is merely the representative of the
Guarantors, and only has the contractual duties set forth herein and in the
Operative Documents. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Agent shall in good faith and in the best interests of the Guarantors have and
may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from
exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Operative Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, or of any other provision of the Operative
Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Guarantors agree that Agent
shall have the right to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement
remains in effect: (a) maintain, in accordance with its customary business
practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the
Collateral and related matters, (b) execute or file any and all financing or
similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents,
instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with respect
to the Operative Documents, (c) exclusively receive, apply, and distribute any
payments received from Obligor or proceeds of Collateral as provided in the
Operative Documents, (d) perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights
and remedies of the Guarantors with respect to Obligor, the Obligations, the
Collateral or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Operative
Documents, and (e) incur and pay such Guaranty Expense Amounts as Agent
reasonably may deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment
of its functions and powers pursuant to the Operative Documents.

              (b) Delegation of Duties. Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement or any other Operative Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Agent shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it
selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful
misconduct, but Agent covenants to monitor and supervise in a reasonable manner
the conduct of such agents or attorneys-in-fact in furtherance of Agent's duties
hereunder.

              (c) Liability of Agent. Neither the Agent nor any of its partners,
members, managers, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in
their duties nor any agent or employee thereof ("Agent-Related Person"), shall
(i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Operative Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Guarantors for
any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Obligor or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Obligor, or any officer or director thereof,
contained in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Operative Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Operative Document, or for any
failure of Obligor or any other party to any Operative Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Guarantor to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Operative Document.

              (d) Reliance by Agent. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Obligor or
counsel to any Guarantor), independent accountants and other experts selected by
Agent. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or any other Operative Document unless Agent shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Guarantors as it deems appropriate and
until such instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting,
as it deems advisable. If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
its reasonable satisfaction by Guarantors against any and all liability and
expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any
such action. Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Operative Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Guarantors and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the
Guarantors.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
              (e) Notice of Default or Event of Default. Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of
Default, except with respect to Events of Default of which Agent has actual
knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Guarantor or
Obligor referring to this Agreement, describing such default or Event of
Default, and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." Agent promptly
will notify the Guarantors of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of
Default or incipient Event of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge. If
any Guarantor obtains actual knowledge of any Event of Default, such Guarantor
promptly shall notify the other Guarantors and Agent of such Event of Default or
incipient Event of Default. Subject to Section 7(d), Agent shall take such
action with respect to such default or Event of Default as may be requested by
the Required Guarantors; provided, however, that unless and until Agent has
received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such default or
Event of Default as it reasonably shall deem advisable.

              (f) Credit Decision. Each Guarantor acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Obligor
and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Guarantor. Each
Guarantor represents to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon any Agent-Related Person and based on public filings of the Obligor and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Obligor and any
other Person (other than the Guarantors) party to an Operative Document, and all
applicable laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Obligor. Each
Guarantor also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Operative Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Obligor and any other
Person (other than the Guarantors) party to an Operative Document. Except for
notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished
to the Guarantors by Agent, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Guarantor with any credit or other information concerning the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of Obligor and any other Person party to an Operative Document
that may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

              (g) Costs and Expenses; Indemnification. Agent may incur and pay
Guaranty Expense Amounts to the extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and
obligations pursuant to the Operative Documents, including court costs,
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, costs of collection by outside
collection agencies and auctioneer fees and costs of security guards or
insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not Obligor are
obligated to reimburse Agent or Guarantors for such expenses pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise. Agent is authorized and directed to deduct and retain
sufficient amounts from any payments or proceeds of Collateral received by Agent
to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs and expenses prior to the
distribution of any amounts to Guarantors. In the event Agent is not reimbursed
for such costs and expenses from such payments or proceeds of Collateral
received by Agent, each Guarantor hereby agrees that it is and shall be
obligated to pay to or reimburse Agent for the amount of such Guarantor's
ratable share thereof. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Guarantors shall indemnify upon demand within five (5) business
days the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of
Obligor and without limiting the obligation of Obligor to do so), according to
their ratable shares, from and against any and all Claims; provided, however,
that no Guarantor shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Claims resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Guarantor shall
reimburse Agent upon demand for such Guarantor's ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Operative Document, or any
document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Obligor. The undertaking in this
Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the
resignation or replacement of Agent.

              (h) Agent in Individual Capacity. Agent and its Affiliates may
make loans to, acquire equity interests in, and generally engage in any kind of
other business with Obligors and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other
Person party to any Operative Documents as though Agent were not Agent
hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other
Guarantors; provided that nothing herein is intended to alter obligations of the
parties that may be set forth other than in the Operative Documents.

              (i) Successor Agent. Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days notice
to the Guarantors. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Guarantors shall appoint a successor Agent for the Guarantors. If no successor
Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent,
Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Guarantors, a successor Agent. If
Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any material provision of
this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Guarantors may agree in
writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from among the
Guarantors. In any such event, upon the acceptance of its appointment as
successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights,
powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such
successor Agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers, and duties as
Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Section 7 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Guarantors shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Guarantors appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.

              (j) Guarantor in Individual Capacity. Any Guarantor and its
respective Affiliates may make loans to, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of other business with Obligors and their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person party to any Operative
Documents as though such Guarantor were not a Guarantor hereunder without notice
to or consent of the Guarantors; provided that nothing herein is intended to
alter obligations of the parties that may be set forth other than in the
Operative Documents.

              (k) Collateral Matters.

                  (a)   The Guarantors hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at
its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Lien on any Collateral (i)
upon the termination of the Guaranty and payment and satisfaction in full by
Obligor of all Obligations, or (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed
of if a release is required or desirable in connection therewith and if Obligor
certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is permitted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents (and Agent may rely
conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry). Except as
provided above, Agent will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any
Collateral without the prior written authorization of the Required Guarantors.
Upon request by Agent or Obligor at any time, the Guarantors will confirm in
writing Agent's authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items
of Collateral pursuant to this Section 7(k); provided, however, that (1) Agent
shall not be required to execute any document necessary to evidence such release

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
on terms that, in Agent's opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any
obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without
recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any
manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than
those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of Obligor in respect of)
all interests retained by Obligor, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of
which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

                  (b)   Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the
Guarantors to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Obligor or is
cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's
Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to
exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care,
disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available to Agent pursuant to any of the
Operative Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the
Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, subject to the terms
and conditions contained herein, Agent may act in any manner it may deem
appropriate, in its sole discretion given Agent's own interest in the Collateral
in its capacity as one of the Guarantors and that Agent shall have no other duty
or liability whatsoever to any Guarantor as to any of the foregoing, except as
otherwise provided herein.

              (l) Restrictions on Actions by Guarantors; Sharing of Payments.

                  (a)   Each of the Guarantors agrees that it shall not, unless
specifically requested to do so by Agent, take or cause to be taken any action,
including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose
any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the
Collateral the purpose of which is, or could be, to give such Guarantor any
preference or priority against the other Guarantors with respect to the
Collateral.

                  (b)   If, at any time or times any Guarantor shall receive (i)
by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any
payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement or the other Operative Documents, except for any such proceeds of
Collateral or payments received by such Guarantor from Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from Agent in excess of such
Guarantor's ratable portion of all such distributions by Agent, such Guarantor
promptly shall turn the same over to Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements
as may be required to negotiate the same to Agent, or in immediately available
funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Guarantors and for
application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

              (m) Concerning the Collateral and Related Operative Documents.
Each of the Guarantors authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this Agreement
and the other Operative Documents relating to the Collateral, for the benefit of
the Guarantors. Each of the Guarantors agrees that any action taken by Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents
relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent of its powers set forth
therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably
incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Guarantors.

              (n) No Liability. Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any
Guarantor any interest in, or subject any Guarantor to any liability for, or in
respect of, the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of any other
Guarantor. Except as provided in Section 7(g), none of the Guarantors shall have
any liability for the acts or any of the other Guarantors.

         8.   MISCELLANEOUS.

Obligor, Agent or Guarantors under this Agreement shall be in writing and
delivered by facsimile, hand delivery, overnight courier service or certified
mail, return receipt requested, to each party at the address most recently
provided by such party to the other party.

              (b) Nonwaiver. No failure or delay on Agent's or any Guarantor's
part in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or of
any other right nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude any other further exercise thereof or of any other right.

              (c) Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified, nor may any of its terms be waived, except by written instruments
signed by Obligor and Required Guarantors. Each waiver or consent under any
provision hereof shall be effective only in the specific instances for the
purpose for which given.

              (d) Assignments. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Agent, Guarantors and Obligor and their respective successors and
assigns; provided, however, that Obligor may not assign or delegate rights and
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Required Guarantors.

              (e) Cumulative Rights, etc. The rights, powers and remedies of
Agent and Guarantors under this Agreement shall be in addition to all rights,
powers and remedies given to Agent and Guarantors by virtue of any applicable
law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any other agreement,
all of which rights, powers, and remedies shall be cumulative and may be
exercised successively or concurrently without impairing Agent's or Guarantor's
rights hereunder.

              (f) Partial Invalidity. If at any time any provision of this
Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under
the law or any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement nor the legality, validity or
enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction shall
in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

              (g) Expenses. Each Obligor shall pay on demand all reasonable fees
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by
Agent and Guarantors in connection with any enforcement or attempt to enforce
any of the obligations of any Obligor which are not performed as and when
required by this Agreement.

              (h) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Operative
Documents constitutes and contains the entire agreement of Obligor and Agent and
Guarantors with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all
prior agreements, negotiations, correspondence, understandings and
communications among the parties, whether written or oral, respecting the
subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, that certain Guaranty
Agreement, dated as of October 8, 2002, by and between Obligor and VantagePoint
Venture Partners III (Q), L.P.

              (i) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without
reference to conflicts of law rules.

              (j) Jury Trial. OBLIGOR, AGENT AND EACH GUARANTOR, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY AS TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

              (k) Release of Additional Guarantors. In the event that an
Additional Guarantor does not enter into a Guaranty on or before January 31,
2003, then such Additional Guarantor's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Operative Documents to which it is a party shall
automatically terminate and such Additional Guarantor shall be deemed released
from this Agreement and such other Operative Documents.

              (l) Right to Terminate Guaranty. In the event that Obligor does
not borrow any loans under the Credit Agreement on or before March 31, 2003,
then the Credit Agreement shall terminate automatically on March 31, 2003
pursuant to its terms and all Guaranties shall automatically terminate on March
31, 2003 pursuant to their respective terms (the "Termination Event"). In the
event of a Termination Event, (i) Guarantor's rights and obligations under each
Operative Document to which it is a party shall automatically terminate and such
Guarantor shall be deemed released from such Operative Document and (ii) any
Warrants issued to Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by
