Executive by the Board of the Company.

         (b) During the Employment Period, Executive shall use his best efforts
to carry out his duties and responsibilities hereunder and devote his entire
working time and effort to the business and affairs of the Company (except for
permitted vacation, illness or disability) and shall not, in any advisory or
other capacity, work for any other individual, firm or entity without first
having obtained the written consent of the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude Executive from devoting
reasonable periods of time to serve on the boards of directors of other
organizations, including charitable and community organizations, provided that
such activities do not interfere in any material fashion (as determined by the
Board in its sole discretion) with the regular and satisfactory performance of
Executive's duties under this Agreement, and, in the sole judgment of the Board,
do not compete with or present a conflict of interest with the interests of the
Company.

         (c) Employee agrees to provide reasonable cooperation at the request of
the Company in any efforts to obtain "key-man" life insurance on Executive's
life.

         Section 3. Compensation.

         (a) During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay Executive a
base salary at the annual rate of no less than $400,000, which amount may be
increased from time to time at the discretion of the Board in accordance with
the Company's existing policy regarding general increases. Payment shall be made
in accordance with the Company's regular practice for Senior Executive employees
as in effect from time to time.

         (b) In addition to the Executive's base salary, as increased from time
to time, Executive shall be entitled to participate in the normal course of
business in the Management Incentive Plan of the Company (a copy of which has
been provided to Executive) and to receive annually such cash bonus payments as

laws), and (ii) award to Executive under the Company's 1994 or 1997 Long Term
Incentive Plans, options to purchase, in the aggregate, 25,000 shares of common

hereunder in accordance with policies established for Senior Executives of the
Company from time to time by the Board.

Company's life insurance program for executives, but maintains or obtains life
insurance through other policies, the Company agrees to reimburse Executive for
the cost of such other insurance up to the amount which the Company would have

such policy (unless such insurance is effected through the Company's group life
insurance program) and shall have the sole right to designate the beneficiaries
of such policy. Executive acknowledges that the Company will report as W-2
income to Executive the premiums paid on such policy.

         (d) During the Employment Period, the Company shall provide Executive

each fiscal year, adjusted pro rata for any partial fiscal year during the term
hereof.

termination for such reason, the Company shall give Executive written notice of
the acts constituting grounds for such termination and in the event such acts
are capable of being cured, the Company shall give Executive a period of 20 days
within which to cease or correct such acts, such that there is no longer grounds
for termination for cause, and if Executive fails to cease or correct such acts

non-renewal of this Agreement (as provided in Section 5(a)(vi) above), by the
Executive for "good reason" (as provided in Section 5(a)(v) above), or by the

immediately preceding the year in which such termination occurs (and if
Executive



                                      -7-
<PAGE>

has been then employed by the Company for less than five full years, the average
shall be calculated for the period Executive was so employed) multiplied by the
percentage derived by dividing (x) the aggregate bonuses awarded to other Senior
Executives for each such year, by (y) the average annual cash bonuses received
by such Senior Executives during the five fiscal years of the Company
immediately preceding the year of calculation, (iii) any unpaid accrued benefits
due to Executive under this Agreement, the SERP or any employee benefit plan in
which Executive was a participant, through the date of such termination, (iv)
reimbursement for any expenses to which Executive is entitled under the terms of
this Agreement through the date of such termination, and (v) any indemnification
obligations to which Executive may become entitled from the Company whether by
contract or pursuant to the Company's charter or Bylaws. The amounts payable
under clause (ii) above shall be calculated separately for each year after
termination, and the amounts due shall be paid when and as bonuses, if any, for
such year are paid to other Senior Executives of the Company. Payments due under
clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company
periodically in accordance with normal payroll practices for Senior Executives.
The payments made pursuant to this Section 6(d) are expressly conditioned upon
Executive's first signing a valid general release and waiver in a form
reasonably acceptable to each of Executive and the Company, pursuant to which
Executive shall release and waive all claims that he may have against the
Company arising during or related in any way to the Executive's employment with
the Company, except for the Company's continuing obligations hereunder.
Executive shall release the Company, its affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and agents. Payments by the Company hereunder shall commence within 30
days after delivery of such executed release provided Executive has not revoked
acceptance of the release.

         (e) Executive shall have no mitigation obligation with respect to the
benefits payable to Executive under this Section 6. Notwithstanding any
termination of this Agreement, Executive shall remain obligated under the
provisions of Sections 9 and 10 of this Agreement.

         (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Agreement, if the
aggregate present value of the payments and benefits to be made or afforded to
the Executive under this Section, plus other payments and benefits to be made or
afforded to Executive in the event of a change of control, would equal or exceed
three times the Executive's "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any successor provision
thereto) as of the date of the change of control, the payments and benefits to
be made or afforded to the Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced to
the extent necessary to ensure that such aggregate present value is one dollar
($1.00) less than three times such base amount. The allocation of the reduction
required hereby among the payments and benefits shall be determined by the
Executive prior to the later of the change of control and the date Executive
gives notice under Section 5(a) (viii) above. The determination of whether the
aggregate present value of payments and benefits to be made or afforded to the
Executive in the event of a change of control would equal or exceed three times
the Executive's base amount, and the amount of the reduction necessary to ensure
that such aggregate present value is one dollar ($1.00) less than three times
such base amount, shall be made by a certified public accountant or other
competent professional selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the
Executive.

requirements and names of suppliers. Executive's obligations under this Section
9(a) shall not be deemed violated in the event that (i) Executive discloses any
such information pursuant to order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
provided Executive has notified the Company of such potential legal order and
provided the Company with the opportunity to challenge or limit the scope of the
disclosure, or (ii) such information becomes generally available from a source
other than the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of their employees when
such source is legally entitled, to the best of Executive's knowledge, to make
such information available.

         (b) Executive agrees, as a condition to the Company's agreeing to
employ him pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder, including but not limited to payments to
Executive after termination of this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement
and any renewals or extensions hereof, and for a period of two (2) years
thereafter, Executive shall not, without the prior written approval of the
Board, directly or indirectly through any other person, firm or entity, whether
individually or in conjunction with any other person, or as an employee, agent,
consultant, representative, partner or holder of any interest in any other
person, firm, entity or other association:

              (i) Solicit, entice or induce any Customer (as defined below) to
become a client, customer, OEM, distributor or reseller of any other person,
firm or entity with respect to products and services then sold or under
development by the Company or to cease doing business with the Company, and
Executive shall not approach any such person, firm or entity for such purpose or
authorize or knowingly approve the taking of any such actions by any other
person; provided however, this paragraph (i) shall be effective after
termination of this Agreement only as a result of termination by the Company
without cause (as provided in Section 5(a)(iv) above), by the Company as a
result of its non-renewal of this Agreement (as provided in Section 5(a)(vi)
above), by the Executive for "good reason" (as provided in Section 5(a)(v)
above), or by the Executive upon a change of control (as provided in Section
5(a)(viii) above, and only for as long as the Company is obligated to make the
payments to Executive provided in Section 6(d)(i) and (ii) above; or

              (ii) Solicit, entice or induce, directly or indirectly, any person
who presently is or at any time during the term hereof, including any renewals
or extensions hereof, was an employee, contractor or business associate of the
Company to become employed by any other person, firm or entity or to cease their
employment or other business relationship with the Company, and Executive shall
not approach any such employee for such purpose.

         For purposes of this Section 9(b), a "Customer" means (x) any person or
entity which at the time of determination is, or shall have been within two
years prior to such time, a client, customer, OEM, distributor or reseller of
the Company, or (y) any person or entity to whom a detailed written proposal has
been made within twelve (12) months immediately preceding the time of
determination.


         (c) Executive agrees that in the event of breach of any of his
obligations under this Section 9, Company shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Executive from violating the provisions hereof and he further agrees
that an action for damages does not provide an

adequate remedy for his violation of this Section 9. The obligations of
Executive under this Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
for any reason whatsoever.

         Section 10. Mediation/Arbitration. Except as provided in Section 9
above or any claims by the Company for injunctive relief, the parties shall
attempt to resolve any dispute through mediation conducted in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. If the parties do not promptly agree on a neutral mediator, then
any of the parties may notify J.A.M.S./Endispute, 345 Park Avenue, New York, New
York, to initiate selection of a mediator from the J.A.M.S/Endispute Panel of
Neutrals. The Company shall pay the fees and expenses of the mediator. If the
mediator is unable to facilitate a settlement of the dispute within a reasonable
period of time, as determined by the mediator, the mediator shall issue a
written statement to the parties to that effect and the aggrieved party(ies) may
then seek relief through arbitration, which shall be binding, before a single
arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the
American Arbitration Association (the "Association"). The place of arbitration
shall be Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Arbitration may be commenced at any time
(after the mediator issues the written statement provided in the fourth sentence
of this Section 10) by any party seeking arbitration by written notice to the
other party(ies) by first class mail, postage prepaid. The arbitrator shall be
selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if the parties do not so
agree within (30) business days after the date of the notice referred to above,
the selection shall be made pursuant to the Rules from the panels of arbitrators
maintained by the Association, and such arbitrator shall be neutral, impartial,
independent of the parties and others having any known interest in the outcome,
shall abide by the ABA and AAA Code of Ethics for neutral arbitrators and shall
have no ex parte communications about the dispute with either party. The
arbitrator shall render a written decision within 60 days of completion of the
arbitration. Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof. The costs and expenses of arbitration, including
legal fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be paid by the parties as the
arbitrator may assess. The arbitrator shall not be permitted to award punitive
or similar type damages under any circumstances. The procedures set forth in
this Section 10 shall constitute the sole and exclusive procedures for the
resolution of any dispute under this Agreement, except for any dispute related
to an alleged violation of Section 9 hereof or any claims by the Company for
injunctive relief, in which case Company, without prejudice to or compliance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 10, is expressly permitted to
institute legal proceedings to obtain a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary and permanent injunction or other equitable relief.

         Section 11. Miscellaneous.
