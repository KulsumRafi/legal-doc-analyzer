                        Disclosure of-Agency Relationship

                          (THIS FORM IS NOT A CONTRACT)

This real estate agent who is providing you with this form is required to do so
by Ohio law. It does not, by itself, obligate you to work with this agent or
his/her brokerage; nor will you be bound to pay any compensation to the agent or
the agent's brokerage by merely signing this form.

Instead, the purpose of this form is to make sure you have the necessary
information you need to know about the role of this agent if you choose to work
together. By signing, you acknowledge that you have been provided this
information and agree to it. If you do not, you can consult with an attorney for
further advice.


As a potential seller/landlord or buyer/tenant of real estate I understand and
agree that

    Chuck McCosh      and     Miller-Valentine Realty, Inc.    will:
    ------------              -----------------------------
        (Agent)                          (Brokerage)



    [X] Represent the seller/landlord
    [_] Represent the buyer/tenant

I also understand and agree that the following may also possibly occur in a real
estate transaction in which I may be involved with this agent:

    [X] The same agent who represents me could potentially represent the other
        party in a transaction involving me. The agent and brokerage would then
        both be dual agents.

    [X] A different agent in the same brokerage could potentially represent the
        other party in a transaction involving me. Each agent would represent
        the interests of their separate client. The brokerage would be dual
        agent. A management level licensee is also a dual agent if representing
        a client in an in-com y transaction.

I have reviewed the information on the reverse side of this form and I have been
given a completed copy of this Disclosure of Agency Relationship.

the Option to Renew.

           NOW THEREFORE, the Lease is amended as follows.


           1. Article 1.  TERM. shall be revised as follows.

           Effective January 1, 2003, the term of this Lease shall be extended
for an additional two (2) years, two (2) months for a total term of fourteen
(14) years, two (2) months, commencing January 1, 1991 and ending February 28,
2006, both dates inclusive.

           2. Lessee warrants that Lessee has accepted and is now in possession

effect. Lessee accepts the Premises in its present "as is" condition.

           3. Article 4. RENT. shall be revised as follows.

           For the two (2) month period commencing January 1, 2003 and ending
February 28, 2003, the Lessee shall occupy the Leased Premises "rent free".

           For the ten (10) month period commencing March 1, 2003 and ending.
December 31, 2003 the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor as Rent for the Leased
Premises the sum of FOUR HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS

THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($44,800.00), due and payable on the

           The Basic Annual Rent of $537,600.00 shall be adjusted annually based
on any increases in the. Consumer Price Index beginning January 1, 2004 and at
the end of each year thereafter, whether during the term of this Lease or any
renewal or extension thereof. Increases in the Annual Rent shall be made in
accordance with the following procedure:


           a. The index to be used for this adjustment shall be the Consumer
Price Index (U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers, All Items, 1982-1984

month of September in each adjustment year shall be the "Adjustment Period
Consumer Price Index".

           c. The Base Period Consumer Price Index shall be subtracted from the
Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index; the difference shall be divided by the
Base Period Consumer Price Index. This quotient shall then be multiplied by the
Basic Annual Rent, and the result shall then be added to the Basic Annual Rent.
The resulting sum shall be the adjusted Annual Rent for such immediately
succeeding leasehold period which shall be paid in equal monthly installments.

           All calculations of said procedure shall be provided to the Lessee in
their entirety directly from EWE Warehouse Investments V, Ltd., the Lessor.

           d. If the said Consumer Price Index is, at any time during the term
of this Lease, discontinued by the Government, then the most nearly comparable
index shall be substituted for the purpose of the aforesaid calculations.

           4. Amendment No. 3, Item 6. OPTION TO RENEW. shall be amended as
follows.

           Lessee is hereby granted an option to renew this Lease for an

Lessee to Lessor not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the end of
the term of this Lease (by August 31, 2005); and

           b. at the time of the giving of such notice and at the expiration of
the term of this Lease, there are no defaults in the covenants, agreements,
terms and conditions on the part of Lessee to be kept and performed, and all
rents are and have been fully paid. Provided also, that the rent to be paid
during each year of the said renewal period shall be as determined in accordance
with the following procedure:

           (1) The index to be used for this adjustment shall be the Consumer
Price Index (U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers, All Items, 1982-1984
equaling a base of 100, from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Washington, D.C.).

           (2) The Consumer Price Index of 2002 for the month of September shall
be the "Base Period Consumer Price Index".

           (3) The Consumer Price Index for the month of September each
succeeding year shall be determined from the published figures and shall be the
"Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index".

           (4) The Base Period Consumer Price Index shall be subtracted from the
Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index; the difference shall be divided by the
Base Period Consumer Price Index. This quotient shall then be multiplied by
$537,600.00 and the result shall then be added to $537,600.00. This arithmetical
sum shall then be the adjusted Basic Annual Rent for such immediately succeeding
leasehold year which shall be paid in equal monthly installments.

           (5) If the said Consumer Price Index is, at any time during the term
of this Lease, discontinued by the Government, then the most nearly comparable
index shall be substituted for the purpose of the aforesaid calculations.
