                        MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

VOTED:    That, pursuant to the recommendation of the Executive Committee, The
          Washington  Trust Company (the "Bank") and  Washington  Trust Bancorp,
          Inc. (the  "Corporation")  terminate the Outside  Directors'  Retainer
          Continuation  Plan (the "Directors'  Plan") and all benefits under the
          Directors'  Plan,   provided  that  all  retired  Directors  currently
          receiving  payments pursuant to the Plan will continue to receive such
          payments in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

VOTED:    That,  pursuant  to the  further  recommendation  of the  Executive
          Committee, the Corporation, in consideration of the termination of the
          Directors' Plan, adopt, and it hereby does adopt, the Washington Trust
          Bancorp, Inc. 1996 Directors' Stock Plan (the "1996 Plan") pursuant to
          which  the  Corporation  shall  issue  to  each  of  its  non-employee
          Directors that number of shares (the aggregate  number of shares to be
          issued,  the "Shares") of common stock of the Corporation,  $.0625 par
          value (the "Common Stock"), as shall be calculated by dividing (i) the
          amount that would be payable to each such Director  under the terms of
          the  Directors'  Plan if it  were to  remain  in  effect,  and if such
          Director were to leave service as a Director  effective  September 30,
          1996,  and if all other  conditions  for payment to each Director were
          satisfied  (as such amount  shall be  calculated  by the Hay Group) by
          (ii) the Average Stock Price.  The "Average  Stock Price" shall be the
          average  of the  closing  prices of Common  Stock as  reported  by the
          Nasdaq Stock Market for each day during the period  beginning  January
          1, 1996 and ending on September 30, 1996.

          which  shall  be  forfeited  to the  Corporation  without  payment  of
          consideration  to the Director in the event that such Director resigns
          from the Board of Directors  without the approval of a majority of the

          terms of such restriction shall terminate on September 30, 1999.

          fractional),  fully paid and non-assessable  shares of Common Stock or
          Restricted  Stock  of the  Corporation  to  which  the  Directors  are
          entitled under these resolutions.
