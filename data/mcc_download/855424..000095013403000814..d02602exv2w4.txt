                                 PROMISSORY NOTE


$1,444,100.00              Orange County, California           November 1, 2002


         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, NEXTGEN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, A DELAWARE
CORPORATION ("Payor") hereby promises to pay to, JANE C. BARBER, an individual,
or order ("Payee") at 315 Shadow Oaks, Irvine, CA, 92618, or such other place as
may be designated from time to time in writing by Payee, in lawful money of the
United States, the principal amount of One Million Four Hundred Forty Four
Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($1,444,100.00), together with no interest, payable
in 60 monthly installments in the amount of Twenty Four Thousand Sixty Six
Dollars and Sixty Seven Cents ($24,066.67) commencing on the first month
following the execution of this Note and continuing on the same day of each
month thereafter until November 1, 2007, when the entire amount of principal and
interest shall be due and payable.

         Each payment shall be credited first to fees or other charges hereunder
(other than interest), next on interest then due and the remainder of such
payment on principal, and interest shall thereupon cease upon the principal so
credited.

         Should interest not be paid when due, it shall be added to principal
and thereafter shall bear like interest as the principal from the scheduled date
of payment pursuant to this Note until paid to Payee and such unpaid interest so
compounded shall not exceed an amount equal to simple interest on the unpaid
amount at the maximum rate permitted by law.

         Repayment of this Note is secured by all of the security documents
executed by Payor (or any other party) in favor of Payee pertaining to and
securing this Note, including those executed simultaneously herewith, those
executed heretofore and those executed hereafter pertaining to and securing this
Note (the "Security Documents").

         In the event that any payment required hereunder or under the Security
Documents shall not be made within ten (10) days after the date due, a late
charge equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum late charge permitted by
applicable state and federal law or (ii) six percent (6%) of the amount of any
such delinquent payment so overdue, may be charged by Payee for the purpose of
defraying the expense incident to handling such delinquent payments. Such late
charge represents the reasonable estimate by Payee and Payor of a fair average
compensation for the loss that may be

sustained by Payee due to the failure of Payor to make timely payments. Such
late charge shall be paid without prejudice to the right of Payee to collect any
other amounts provided to be paid hereunder, under the Security Documents, or to
declare a default hereunder or under the Security Documents.

         This Note shall become immediately due and payable at the option of
Payee or other holder hereof, without presentment or demand or any notice of
intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or any other notice to the Payor
or any other person obligated or to become obligated hereon, upon the occurrence
of any of the following events: (a) Payor's failure to pay (or cause to be paid)
any installment hereon on the date such installment is due; (b) upon default
under the terms of any of the Security Documents; (c) if any other event occurs
or condition exists which authorizes the acceleration of maturity hereof under
any agreement made by the Payor in connection with the Security Documents; (d)
if, pursuant to or within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
any other federal or state law relating to insolvency or relief of debtors (a
"Bankruptcy Law"), Payor shall (i) commence a voluntary case or proceeding; (ii)
consent to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;
(iii) consent to the appointment of a trustee, receiver, assignee, liquidator or
similar official; (iv) make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or
(v) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due; or (e)
if a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any
Bankruptcy Law that (i) is for relief against Payor in an involuntary case, (ii)
appoints a trustee, receiver, assignee, liquidator or similar official for Payor
or substantially all of Payor's properties, or (iii) orders the liquidation of
Payor, and in each case the order or decree is not dismissed within sixty (60)
days.

         If the holder of this Note (a) refers it to an attorney for collection,
(b) seeks legal advice following a default under this Note, or the Security
Documents securing this Note, (c) commences an action on this Note, or any of
the other Security Documents securing this Note, (d) engages an attorney to
appear in any judicial action or non-judicial proceeding commenced by any person
relating to this Note, or any of the Security Documents securing this Note,
including, but not limited to actions or proceedings (l) under any Bankruptcy
Law, (2) for condemnation, (3) under the California Probate Code, (4) in
connection with any state or federal tax lien, or (5) involving mechanics' or
materialmen's liens or stop notices or (e) engages an attorney to enforce its
rights in regards to the Collateral, pledged or otherwise serving as security
for this Note, by the appointment of a receiver or otherwise, then, in any of
such events set forth in (a) through (e), above, Payor and each person who
assumes the obligations evidenced hereby or who becomes the owner of any
security for this Note, promise to pay all actual attorneys' fees for services
performed by the holder's attorney and all costs and expenses incurred incident
to such engagement.

         The Payor and all sureties, endorsers, and guarantors of this Note (i)
waive demand, presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, notice of intent
to accelerate, notice of acceleration, protest, notice of protest, and all other
notice, filing of suit, and diligence in collecting this Note or enforcing any
of the security herefore, (ii) agree to any substitution, exchange, or release
of any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon (iii) agree that Payee or
other holder hereof shall not be required first to institute suit or exhaust as
remedies hereon against Payor or others liable or to become liable hereon or to
enforce its rights against any security hereof in order to enforce payment of
this Note by them, and (iv) consent to any extensions or postponements of time
of payment of this Note and to any other indulgence with respect hereto without
notice thereof to any of them. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
prevent Payee from exercising and enforcing any other remedy allowed at law or
in equity or by any statute or by the terms of this Note or the Security
Documents nor shall anything herein contained be deemed to be a release or
impairment of any of the Security Documents, or the indebtedness evidenced by
this Note or secured thereby or shall be deemed to prejudice the right of the
Payee as against Payor, or any other entity now or hereafter liable under any
guaranty, bond, or lease, or any portion thereof, policy of insurance or other
agreement which Payor may have delivered to Payee in compliance with any of the
terms, covenants, and conditions of this Note or any of the Security Documents,
or from enforcing any of the Payee's rights under this Note or under any of the
Security Documents including, without limitation, the right to the appointment
of a receiver, or limit the rights or remedies to which Payee would otherwise be
entitled to at law or in equity.

         This Note is intended to be performed in accordance with and only to
the extent permitted by all applicable law. If any portion of this Note or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason and to
any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, neither the remainder of this
instrument nor the application of such provisions to other persons or
circumstances shall be affected hereby, but rather shall be enforced to the
greatest extent permitted by law.

         This Note will be governed by the laws of the State of California.
Payor and any endorser of this Note involved in any litigation (whether or not
arising out of or relating to this Note or such other obligations as may be
concurrently secured) in which Payee, Payor or endorser and any of them shall be
adverse parties, hereby consent to the exclusive venue of Orange County,
California, for any and all legal proceedings based upon or arising out of this
Note.

         This Note is expressly limited so that in no contingency or event
whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the unpaid
principal balance hereof,


                                       3
<PAGE>


or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Payee for the use,
forbearance or detention of the money advanced hereunder exceed the highest rate
permissible under applicable law. If, from any circumstances whatsoever,
fulfillment of any provision hereof shall involve transcending the limit of
validity prescribed by law which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem
applicable hereto, then ipso facto. The obligation to be fulfilled shall be
reduced to the limit of such validity, and, if under any circumstances the Payee
shall ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful
rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the
reduction of the unpaid principal balance due hereunder and to the payment of
interest.

         The terms of this Note shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
administrators, executors and assigns.
