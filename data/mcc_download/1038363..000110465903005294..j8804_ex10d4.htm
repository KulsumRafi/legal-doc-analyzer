shall enter into a business or pursue other activities not in competition with
the Company, or similar activities or business in locations the operation of
which, under such circumstances, does not violate clause (a) of this Section 3,
and in any event such new business, activities or location are not in violation
of this Section 3 or of Executive&#146;s obligations under this Section 3, if any,
Executive shall not be chargeable with a violation of this Section 3 if the
Company shall thereafter enter the same, similar or a competitive (i) business,

the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest

unenforceability shall in no way be deemed or construed to affect in any way

of the covenants in this Section 3 shall be construed as an agreement
independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any
claim or cause of action of Executive against the Company, whether predicated
on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement by the Company of such covenants.&#160;
It is specifically agreed that the period of twelve (12) months
following termination of employment stated at the beginning of this Section 3,
during which the agreements and covenants of Executive made in this Section 3
shall continue to be effective, shall be computed by excluding from such
computation any time during which Executive is in violation of any provision of
this Section 3.&#160; Executive specifically
agrees that the restrictions in this Section 3 are reasonable, and that none of
the restrictions shall cause any unreasonable hardship to Executive.</font></p>

any unresolved dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a panel
of three (3) arbitrators in Wilmington, North Carolina&#160; in accordance with the National Rules for
the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association
(&#147;AAA&#148;) then in effect, provided that Executive shall comply with the Company&#146;s
grievance procedures in an effort to resolve such dispute or controversy before
resorting to arbitration, and provided further that the parties may agree to
use arbitrators other than those provided by the AAA.&#160; The arbitrators shall not have the authority to add to, detract
from, or modify any provision hereof not to award punitive damages to any
injured party.&#160; The arbitrators shall
have the authority to order back-pay, severance compensation, vesting of
options (or cash compensation in lieu of vesting of options), reimbursement of
costs, including those incurred to enforce this Agreement, and interest thereon
in the event the arbitrators determine that Executive was terminated without
disability or Cause, or that the Company has otherwise materially breached this
Agreement.&#160; A decision by a majority of
the arbitration panel shall be final and binding.&#160; Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator&#146;s award in any court
having jurisdiction.&#160; The direct expense
of any arbitration proceeding shall be divided equally between the parties and
each party shall pay its own attorneys&#146; fees regardless of the outcome of the
arbitration.</font></p>
