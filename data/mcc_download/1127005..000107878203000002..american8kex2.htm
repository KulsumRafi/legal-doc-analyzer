position inconsistent with the Allocation except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.</P>

<P><STRONG>ARTICLE IV. </STRONG>  <STRONG><A NAME="_Toc25131867">REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER<BR>
AND GENERAL PARTNER</A></STRONG></P>

<P>As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
Seller and General Partner hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer, which representations and
warranties shall be true and correct on the date hereof and as of the date of Closing, as follows:</P>

<P>4.1 <A NAME="_Toc25131868">Organization, Qualification and Authority.</A>  Seller is a limited partnership duly organized and validly existing in the
State of Texas and is in good standing.  Since the date of its organization, Seller has consistently observed and operated
within the formalities of the jurisdictions in which it is formed and/or conducts the Business, and has generally observed
and complied with the general corporation law of such jurisdictions.  Seller and General Partner has full power and
authority to own, lease and operate its facilities and assets as presently owned, leased and operated; to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted; and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions where
the Business is conducted.  Except for its limited partner(s) and General Partner, no other person or entity owns or holds,
has any interest in, whether legal, equitable or beneficial, or has the right to purchase, any capital stock, partnership
interest, or other security of Seller.  Seller owns no capital stock, security, interest or other right, or any option or warrant
convertible into the same, of any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise.  Seller has the full
right, power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms of this Agreement and all documents and agreements
necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated on the part of
Seller hereby.  General Partner has the full right, power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms of this
Agreement and all documents and agreements necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement, to consummate
the transactions contemplated on the part of General Partner hereby, and to take all actions necessary, in its capacity as the
General Partner of Seller, to permit or approve the actions of Seller taken in connection with this Agreement.  The
execution, delivery and consummation of this Agreement, and all other agreements and documents executed in connection
herewith by Seller, have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller.  No other action, consent or
approval on the part of Seller, General Partner or any other person or entity is necessary to authorize Seller's due and valid
execution, delivery and consummation of this Agreement and all other agreements and documents executed in connection
hereto.  This Agreement and all other agreements and documents executed in connection herewith by Seller and General
Partner, upon due execution and delivery thereof, shall constitute the valid and binding obligations of each of Seller and
General Partner, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of

<P>13.4 <A NAME="_Toc25131944">Rules Regarding Indemnification.</A>  The obligations and liabilities of each party which may be subject to
indemnification liability hereunder (the "indemnifying party") to the other party (the "indemnified party") shall be subject
to the following terms and conditions:</P>

<P>(1) Claims by Non-parties.  The indemnified party shall give written notice within a reasonably prompt period of time to
the indemnifying party of any written claim by a third party which is likely to give rise to a claim by the indemnified party
against the indemnifying party based on the indemnity agreements contained in this Article, stating the nature of said claim
and the amount thereof, to the extent known.  The indemnified party shall give notice to the indemnifying party that
pursuant to the indemnity, the indemnified party is asserting against the indemnifying party a claim with respect to a
potential loss from the third party claim, and such notice shall constitute the assertion of a claim for indemnity by the
indemnified party.  If, within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, the indemnifying party advises the indemnified
party that it will provide indemnification and assume the defense at its expense, then so long as such defense is being
conducted, the indemnified party shall not settle or admit liability with respect to the claim and shall afford to the
indemnifying party and defending counsel reasonable assistance in defending against the claim.  If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense, counsel shall be selected by such party and if the indemnified party then retains its own counsel, it
shall do so at its own expense.  If the indemnified party does not receive a written objection to the notice from the
indemnifying party within thirty (30) days after the indemnifying party's receipt of such notice, the claim for indemnity
shall be conclusively presumed to have been assented to and approved, and in such case the indemnified party may control
the defense of the matter or case and, at its sole discretion, settle or admit liability.  If within the aforesaid thirty (30) day
period the indemnified party shall have received written objection to a claim (which written objection shall briefly describe
the basis of the objection to the claim or the amount thereof, all in good faith), then for a period of ten (10) days after
receipt of such objection the parties shall attempt to settle the dispute as between the indemnified and indemnifying parties.
If they are unable to settle the dispute, the unresolved issue or issues shall be settled by arbitration in Dallas, Texas in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.</P>

<P>(2) Claims by a Party.  The determination of a claim asserted by a party hereunder (other than as set forth in subparagraph
(1) above) pursuant to this Article shall be made as follows: The indemnified party shall give written notice within a
reasonably prompt period of time to the indemnifying party of any claim by the indemnified party which has not been made
pursuant to subparagraph (1) above, stating the nature of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known.  The
claim shall be deemed to have resulted in a determination in favor of the indemnified party and to have resulted in a
liability of the indemnifying party in an amount equal to the amount of such claim estimated pursuant to this paragraph if
within forty-five (45) days after the indemnifying party's receipt of the claim the indemnified party shall not have received
written objection to the claim.  In such event, the claim shall be conclusively presumed to have been assented to and
approved.  If within the aforesaid forty-five (45) day period the indemnified party shall have received written objection to a
claim (which written objection shall briefly describe the basis of the objection to the claim or the amount thereof, all in
good faith), then for a period of sixty (60) days after receipt of such objection the parties shall attempt to settle the disputed
claim as between the indemnified and indemnifying parties.  If they are unable to settle the disputed claim, the unresolved
issue or issues shall be settled by arbitration in Salt Lake City, Utah in accordance with the rules and procedures of the
American Arbitration Association.</P>

<P>(3) Claims by a Straddle Customer or Patient.  Any claim by a customer or patient relating to professional negligence or
similar matters involving a customer or patient served both on or prior to and subsequent to Closing will be the
responsibility of either Seller and General Partner, jointly and severally on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand,  in
accordance with the following guidelines: (i) if it is a claim in which the incident giving rise to liability clearly arose on or
before the date of Closing, Seller and General Partner shall respond to the loss and defense expenses; (ii)  if it is a claim in
which the incident giving rise to liability clearly arose subsequent to the date of Closing, Buyer shall respond to the loss
and defense expenses; and (iii) in the event that the incident giving rise to liability as to time is not clear, Seller, General
Partner and Buyer will jointly defend the case and each will fully cooperate with the others in such defense.  Once the case
is closed, if Buyer and Seller and General Partner cannot agree to the allocation of both indemnity and expenses, then the
matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Salt Lake City, Utah in accordance with the rules and procedures of the
American Arbitration Association.</P>

<P><STRONG>ARTICLE XIV. </STRONG>  <STRONG><A NAME="_Toc25131945">PRESERVATION OF BUSINESS AND NONCOMPETE RESTRICTIONS</A></STRONG></P>

<P>14.1 <A NAME="_Toc25131946">Covenant Not to Compete.</A>  Seller and General Partner hereby, jointly and severally, covenant and agree with Buyer
that, during the "Noncompete Period" (as such term is defined herein) neither Seller nor General Partner shall directly or
indirectly, (a) within the "Noncompete Area" (as such term if defined herein), acquire, lease, manage, consult for, serve as
agent or subcontractor for, finance, invest in, own any part of or exercise management control over any pharmaceutical
operation or business which provides any goods or  services competitive with the goods and services provided by the
Business as of the Closing; (b) solicit for employment or employ any person who at Closing or thereafter became an
employee of Buyer or an Affiliate unless such person is not so employed for at least six (6) months; or (c) with respect to
any customer, patient, physician, physician group, or healthcare provider with whom Buyer or an Affiliate contracts with or
serves in connection with the Business subsequent to Closing, or any potential customer with whom Buyer or Affiliate may
reasonably be expected to contract with or service in connection with the Business within six (6) months of the Closing,
either solicit the same in a manner which could adversely affect Buyer or an Affiliate or make statements to the same which
disparage Buyer, an Affiliate, the Business or their respective operations in anyway.  The "Noncompete Period" shall
commence at the Closing and terminate on the fifth anniversary thereof.  The "Noncompete Area" shall mean (a) the area
within a one hundred (100) mile radius of each location from, at, or for which Seller delivers pharmaceuticals as of the
Closing and (b) the area within a one hundred fifty (150) mile radius of (i) each Texas location from which the business of
Buyer or Affiliate is operated or conducted as of the Closing, and (iii) each location from which the Business is operated or
conducted as of the Closing.  Ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the stock of a publicly held company shall not be
deemed a breach of this covenant. </P>

<P>14.2 <A NAME="_Toc25131947">Enforceability.</A>  In the event of a breach of paragraph 14.1, Seller and General Partner recognize that monetary
damages shall be inadequate to compensate Buyer and Buyer shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond or similar
security, to an injunction restraining such breach, with the costs (including attorneys fees) of securing such injunction to be
jointly and severally borne by Seller and General Partner.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting
Buyer from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach.</P>

<P>All parties hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against the competition of Seller and General Partner and that
the nature and scope of such protection has been carefully considered by the parties.  The period provided and the area
covered are expressly represented and agreed to be fair, reasonable and necessary.  The consideration provided for herein is
deemed to be sufficient and adequate to compensate Seller and General Partner for agreeing to the restrictions contained in
paragraph 14.1.  If, however, any court determines that the forgoing restrictions are not reasonable, such restrictions shall
be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of their nature and scope as will render them enforceable.</P>

<P><STRONG>ARTICLE XV. </STRONG>  <STRONG><A NAME="_Toc25131948">MISCELLANEOUS</A></STRONG></P>

<P>15.1 <A NAME="_Toc25131949">Assignment.</A>  Following Closing, Buyer may freely assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Agreement without the express written consent of Seller or General Partner.  Neither Seller nor
General Partner may assign any rights or delegate any obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Buyer, and any prohibited assignment or delegation will be null and void.</P>

<P>15.2 <A NAME="_Toc25131950">Other Expenses.</A>  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller and General Partner shall pay all of their
expenses in connection with the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and Buyer shall pay all of its expenses in connection with the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  In the event Seller or General Partner has retained a broker or finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, such fee shall be paid in full at Closing by a deduction to the
cash portion of the Purchase Price, and Seller will provide Buyer a pay-off letter from the broker or finder in form
satisfactory to Buyer.  All state and local sales and use taxes, recording fees and transfer taxes incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated within this Agreement shall be borne and timely paid by Buyer.  All ad valoremtaxes
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated within this Agreement shall be shared equally by Seller and
Buyer and shall be prorated as of Closing.  The Purchase Price shall be reduced, on a dollar-per-dollar basis, to the extent
and in an amount equal to any taxes that are accrued but unpaid by Seller as of the date of Closing.</P>

<P>15.3 <A NAME="_Toc25131951">Notices.</A>  All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications required or permitted to be given under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (a) if delivered personally or sent by
facsimile, on the date received, (b) if delivered by overnight courier, on the day after mailing, and (c) if mailed, five days
after mailing with postage prepaid.  Any such notice shall be sent as follows:</P>

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder, unless disclosure is required by law.  Seller, General Partner and
their Affiliates agree not to trade in the securities of Buyer or its Affiliates based upon any nonpublic information.</P>

<P>15.5 <A NAME="_Toc25131953">Controlling Law.</A>  This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Utah.</P>

<P>15.6 <A NAME="_Toc25131954">Headings.</A>  Any table of contents and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and
shall not be considered or referred to in resolving questions of interpretation.</P>

<P>15.7 <A NAME="_Toc25131955">Benefit.</A>  Subject to paragraph 15.1, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the exclusive benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.  This Agreement is not intended
to, nor shall it, create any rights in any other party.</P>

<P>15.8 <A NAME="_Toc25131956">Partial Invalidity.</A>  The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provisions
were omitted.  Further, there shall be automatically substituted for such invalid or unenforceable provision a provision as
similar as possible which is valid and enforceable.</P>

<P>15.9 <A NAME="_Toc25131957">Waiver.</A>  Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any rights, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, or of any other right, power or remedy; nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any right, power or remedy preclude any further or other exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by the party
against which it is sought to be enforced.</P>

<P>15.10 <A NAME="_Toc25131958">Counterparts.</A>  This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be

feminine, neuter, singular or plural as the identity of the person or entity, or the context, may require.  Further, it is
acknowledged by the parties that this Agreement has undergone several drafts with the negotiated suggestions of both; and,
therefore, no presumptions shall arise favoring either party by virtue of the authorship of any of its provisions or the
changes made through revisions.  Whenever in this Agreement the term "to the best knowledge of Seller or General
Partner" or the like is used, Seller and General Partner shall each be deemed to have the knowledge of Seller's General
Partner, officers, directors and key employees, and of its Affiliates; and Seller and General Partner shall each be under a
duty of due inquiry.  </P>

<P>15.12 <A NAME="_Toc25131960">Entire Agreement.</A>  This Agreement, including the Exhibits and attachments hereto, which are incorporated herein by
reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with regard to the matters contained herein and it is
understood and agreed that all previous undertakings, negotiations, letters of intent and agreements between the parties are
merged herein.  This Agreement may not be modified orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by Buyer, Seller
and General Partner.</P>

<P>15.13 <A NAME="_Toc25131961">Legal Fees and Costs.</A>  In the event any party incurs legal expenses to enforce or interpret any provision of this
Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover such legal expenses, including, without limitation, attorney's
fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any other relief to which such party shall be entitled.<BR>
