<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to October&nbsp;15, 1999, Shields was an employee of NavTech. On October&nbsp;15, 1999, NavTech and Shields terminated Shields' employment agreement
with NavTech and entered into a certain Separation Agreement, under which NavTech agreed to provide "[c]ontinuation of Shields' health and dental benefits for one year after
the Termination Date." Pursuant to a First Amendment to the Separation Agreement dated October&nbsp;15, 2000, the Termination Date of the Separation Agreement, and thus the continuation of Shields'
health and dental benefits, was extended to October&nbsp;15, 2001, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment to the Agreement, the term of the
Agreement was extended from October&nbsp;15, 2001 to October&nbsp;15, 2002. Since the expiration of the Separation Agreement, and concurrent with the term of the Agreement as extended under the
First Amendment, NavTech continued to provide Shields with health and dental benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Second Amendment to the Agreement, the term of the Agreement has been extended to April&nbsp;15, 2003. NavTech and Shields desire to clarify that NavTech's continuation
of Shields' health and dental benefits since October&nbsp;15, 2001 constituted additional consideration to Shields under the Agreement, and that NavTech will continue to provide such health and
dental benefits through the current term of the Agreement as extended by the Second Amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Wherefore:  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to approval from the NavTech Board of Directors, Section&nbsp;4 of the Agreement is amended by adding the following sentence: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Commencing
on October&nbsp;15, 2001 and through April&nbsp;15, 2003</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> NavTech shall continue Shields' health and dental benefits." </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
witness whereof, each of the parties has executed this Second Amendment as of the date first written above. </FONT></P>
