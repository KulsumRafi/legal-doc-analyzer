7.0   If any event occurs that will materially affect the time for completion of
      new facilities or the ability to complete them, Transmission Provider
      shall promptly notify the Transmission Customer. A technical meeting
      between the Parties shall be held to evaluate the alternatives available.
      If the Transmission Provider and the Transmission Customer mutually agree
      that no other reasonable alternatives exist and the requested service
      cannot be provided out of existing capability under the conditions of Part
      II of the Tariff, the obligation to provide the requested Firm
      Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall terminate and any deposit made
      by the Transmission Customer shall be returned with interest pursuant to
      Commission regulations 35.19a(a)(2)(iii). However, the Transmission
      Customer shall be responsible for all prudently incurred costs by the
      Transmission Provider through the time construction was suspended.

      Transmission Provider:
            Director, Regional Transmission
            Nevada Power Company

8.0   The Tariff is incorporated herein and made a part hereof.

9.0   The Transmission Customer may terminate this agreement prior to the date
      specified in Section 1.0 as follows:

      9.1   The Transmission Customer has submitted requests for service that
            would result in a transmission service request for capacity leading
            from the Crystal substation to delivery points in the El Dorado
            Valley (the "Second Service Request"). The Transmission Customer
            shall have the right to terminate this agreement under this Section
            9.0 if the Transmission Provider's processing of the Second Service
            Request does not result in a transmission service agreement filed at
            FERC no later than October 15, 2002, that has the following
            attributes:

            9.1.1 Firm point-to-point Transmission service for a 25-year term
                  for 500 MW from the Crystal substation to delivery points in
                  the El Dorado Valley, provided at the Transmission Provider's

            9.1.2 Transmission service to commence no later than January 1,
                  2005.

            9.1.3 The amount of the Transmission Customer's regional required
                  upgrades resulting from the interconnection of the
                  Transmission Customer's generation facility to the
                  Transmission Provider's system has not increased solely as a
                  consequence of the Second Service Request.

            9.1.4 Transmission Provider will accept as security any of the
                  acceptable forms of security listed in the Settlement
                  Agreement in Docket Nos. ER01-2754, et al. If any upgrades
                  necessary for the Second Service Request are made exclusively
                  for the Second Service Request, Transmission Provider will
                  permit a ramped-up security arrangement whereby security will
                  be required only as Transmission Provider makes expenditures
                  for the upgrades. If necessary upgrades are made for the
                  Second Service Request and other service requests as a group,
                  Transmission Provider will permit a ramped-up security
                  arrangement to the extent practical.

      9.2   In the event that a transmission service agreement with the above
            attributes is not filed at FERC by October 15, 2002, then the
            Transmission Customer shall have thirty days to provide the
            Transmission Provider with notice of termination of this agreement.
            If notice of termination is not provided within 30 days, then the
            Transmission Customer shall no longer have any right to terminate
            under this Section 9.0.

      9.3   In the event that the Transmission Customer does terminate this
            agreement pursuant to this Section 9.0, it shall be responsible for
            all nonmitigable damages incurred by the Transmission Provider,
            provided that in no event shall the Transmission Customer be
            obligated to pay more than $10,000,000 in damages (the "Damages
            Cap"). The Transmission Provider shall use its reasonable efforts to
            mitigate any damages, including but not limited to, permitting
            another credit worthy customer to assume all or part of the
            Transmission Customer's rights and obligations or reducing the scope
            of the upgrade facilities to the extent it is possible to do so and
            still satisfy all other requests for service to be satisfied with
            such facilities. The Damages Cap shall not be construed to be a
            liquidated damages provision and shall not relieve the Transmission
            Provider of its obligation to mitigate its damages or prove the
            amount of its claim.
