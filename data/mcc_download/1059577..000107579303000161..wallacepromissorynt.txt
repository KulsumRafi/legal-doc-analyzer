                                 PROMISSORY NOTE


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, MW Medical, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(or  its  successor  or assigns) promises to pay to the order of Jan Wallace, an
individual,  at  such  address  as may be designated in writing by the holder of
this  Note,  the  principal  sum  of TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND, THREE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS and NO CENTS ($248,325.00) in U.S. currency. The
entire  amount  of  principal  with  ten  percent (10%) interest per annum shall
become  due  and  payable  on  June  15,  2003.

     The  undersigned  and its successors and assigns, hereby waives presentment
and  demand  for  payment,  diligence, notice of dishonor, protest and notice of
protest  of  this  Note,  and  any defense by reason of an extension of time for
payment  or  other indulgence.  Failure of the holder to assert any right herein
shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  a  waiver  thereof.

     This Promissory Note is made in settlement of all wages and employment fees
owed  to  payee  to  date.

     The  holder  of this note may, at its option, convert all or any portion of
the  promissory  note to equity of MW at the same price as is available to those
investors  participating  in  the  any  private  placement  while  this  debt is
outstanding.  In the event that the holder of this Note wishes to convert during
a period of time when no private offering of common stock is open, then the Note
holder  may  convert  at  50%  of the market price at that time, or at $0.20 per
share,  whichever  is  lower.

Signed  this  15th  day  of  March,  2003


                                       MW  Medical,  Inc.
