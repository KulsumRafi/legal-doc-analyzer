group of management and highly compensated Employees and Directors who
contribute materially to the continued growth, development, and future business
success of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., a federally chartered savings bank, and its

and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.

         Effective as of January 1, 2001, the INMC Mortgage Holdings, Inc.

                                   DEFINITIONS

         For purposes of this Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the
context, the following phrases or terms shall have the following indicated
meanings:

         of: (i) the Deferral Account balance; (ii) the vested portion of the
         Company Matching Account balance; and (iii) the Rollover Account
         balance. This account, and each other specified account, shall be a
         bookkeeping entry only and shall be utilized solely as a device for the
         measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to a
         Participant, or his or her designated Beneficiary, pursuant to this
         Plan.

1.2      "Annual Bonus" shall mean any annual cash compensation, in addition to
         Base Annual Salary and Commissions, relating to services performed
         during any calendar year, whether or not paid in such calendar year,
         payable to a Participant under any Employer's annual bonus and cash
         incentive plans.

1.3      "Annual Company Matching Amount" shall mean, for any one Plan Year, the
         amount determined in accordance with Section 3.5.

1.4      "Annual Deferral Amount" shall mean that portion of a Participant's
         Base Annual Salary, Annual Bonus, Commissions, and/or Directors Fees

         this Plan for the various benefits available, and the next annual
         installment, and all annual installments thereafter, being paid on
         December 31 of each Plan Year or within a reasonable period of time
         thereafter. For example, if a Participant Retires on June 30, 2001, and
         he or she elects the Annual Installment Method, the first equal
         installment shall be payable no later than 60 days after Retirement,
         the next equal installment shall be payable on December 31, 2001, and

         other allowances paid to a Participant for employment services rendered
         (whether or not such allowances are included in the Employee's gross
         income). Base Annual Salary shall be calculated before reduction for
         compensation voluntarily deferred or contributed by the Participant
         pursuant to all qualified or non-qualified plans of any Employer and
         shall be calculated to include amounts not otherwise included in the
         Participant's gross income under Code Sections 125, 402(e)(3), 402(h),
         or 403(b) pursuant to plans established by any Employer; provided,
         however, that all such amounts will be included in compensation only to
         the extent that, had there been no such plan, the amount would have
         been payable in cash to the Employee.

1.8      "Beneficiary" shall mean one or more persons, trusts, estates or other

                  Company and/or Bancorp immediately before such reorganization
                  (assuming for purposes of such determination that there is no
                  change in the record ownership of the Company's and/or
                  Bancorp's securities from the record date for such approval
                  until such reorganization);

         (c)      Approval by the shareholders of the Company and/or Bancorp of
                  the sale of substantially all of the Company's and/or

                  is not a subsidiary or other affiliate;

         (d)      Any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act")
                  becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
                  the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of
                  the Company and/or Bancorp representing more than twenty-five
                  percent (25%) of the combined voting power of the Company's

         (e)      During any period not longer than two consecutive years,

                  constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election,
                  or the nomination for election by the Company's and/or
                  Bancorp's shareholders, of each new board member was approved
                  by a vote of at least a majority of the board members then
                  still in office who were board members at the beginning of
                  such period (including for these purposes, new members whose
                  election or nomination was so approved, but, in the case of
                  successors to such new members, without duplication).

1.13     "Claimant" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 14.1.

1.14     "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                                      - 3 -

         to a Participant in the form of commissions.

1.16     "Committee" shall mean the committee described in Article 12.

1.17     "Company" shall mean IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (the successor in interest to
         IndyMac, Inc.), a federally chartered savings bank, and any successor
         to all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business.

1.18     "Company Matching Account" shall mean: (i) the sum of the Participant's
         Annual Company Matching Amounts; plus (ii) amounts credited in
         accordance with all the applicable crediting provisions of this Plan
         that relate to the Participant's Company Matching Account; less (iii)
         all distributions made to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary
         pursuant to this Plan that relate to the Participant's Company Matching
         Account.

1.19     "Deduction Limitation" shall mean the following described limitation on
         a benefit that may otherwise be distributable pursuant to the
         provisions of this Plan. Except as otherwise provided, this limitation
         shall be applied to all distributions that are "subject to the
         Deduction Limitation" under this Plan. If an Employer determines in
         good faith prior to a Change in Control that there is a reasonable
         likelihood that any compensation paid to a Participant for a taxable
         year of the Employer would not be deductible by the Employer solely by
         reason of the limitation under Code Section 162(m), then to the extent
         deemed necessary by the Employer to ensure that the entire amount of
         any distribution to the Participant pursuant to this Plan prior to the
         Change in Control is deductible, the Employer may defer all or any
         portion of a distribution under this Plan. Any amounts deferred
         pursuant to this limitation shall continue to be credited with
         additional amounts in accordance with Section 3.9 below, even if such
         amount is being paid out in installments. The amounts so deferred and
         amounts credited thereon shall be distributed to the Participant or his
         or her Beneficiary (in the event of the Participant's death) at the
         earliest possible date, as determined by the Employer in good faith, on
         which the deductibility of compensation paid or payable to the
         Participant for the taxable year of the Employer during which the
         distribution is made will not be limited by Section 162(m), or if
         earlier, the effective date of a Change in Control. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary in this Plan, the Deduction Limitation shall
         not apply to any distributions made after a Change in Control.

1.20     "Deferral Account" shall mean: (i) the sum of all of a Participant's
         Annual Deferral Amounts; plus (ii) amounts credited in accordance with
         all the applicable crediting provisions of this Plan that relate to the
         Participant's

                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>
         Deferral Account; less (iii) all distributions made to the Participant
         or his or her Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan that relate to his or
         her Deferral Account.

1.21     "Director" shall mean any member of the board of directors of any
         Employer.

1.22     "Directors Fees" shall mean the annual fees paid to a Participant by
         any Employer, including retainer fees and meeting fees, as compensation
         for serving on the board of directors.

1.23     "Disability" shall mean a period of disability during which a
         Participant qualifies for permanent disability benefits under the
         Participant's Employer's long-term disability plan, or, if a
         Participant does not participate in such a plan, a period of disability
         during which the Participant would have qualified for permanent
         disability benefits under such a plan had the Participant been a
         participant in such a plan, as determined in the sole discretion of the
         Committee. If the Participant's Employer does not sponsor such a plan,
         or discontinues to sponsor such a plan, Disability shall be determined
         by the Committee in its sole discretion.

1.24     "Disability Benefit" shall mean the benefit set forth in Article 8.

1.25     "Election Form" shall mean the form established from time to time by
         the Committee that a Participant completes, signs and returns to the
         Committee to make an election under the Plan.

1.26     "Employee" shall mean a person who is an employee of any Employer.

1.27     "Employer(s)" shall mean the Company and/or any of its affiliates (now
         in existence or hereafter formed or acquired) that have been selected
         by the Board to participate in the Plan and have adopted the Plan as a
         sponsor.

1.28     "ERISA" shall mean the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
         as amended.

1.29     "Participant" shall mean any Employee or Director (i) who is selected
         to participate in the Plan, (ii) who elects to participate in the Plan,
         (iii) who signs a Plan Agreement, an Election Form and a Beneficiary
         Designation Form, (iv) whose signed Plan Agreement, Election Form and
         Beneficiary Designation Form are accepted by the Committee, (v) who
         commences participation in the Plan, and (vi) whose Plan Agreement has

         (b)      SHORT PLAN YEAR. If a Participant first becomes a Participant
                  after the first day of a Plan Year, the minimum deferral shall

                  entered the Plan, performed services related to the Annual
                  Bonus that the Participant earned for the Plan Year that he or
                  she first entered the Plan, then such Participant may not
                  defer any portion of the Annual Bonus that the Participant
                  earned for the Plan Year that he or she first entered the
                  Plan.

3.3      ELECTION TO DEFER; EFFECT OF ELECTION FORM:

         (a)      FIRST PLAN YEAR. In connection with a Participant's

                  shall make an irrevocable deferral election for the Plan Year
                  in which the Participant commences participation in the Plan,
                  along with such other elections as the Committee deems
                  necessary or desirable under the Plan. For these elections to
                  be valid, the election forms must be completed and signed by
                  the Participant, timely delivered to the Committee (in
                  accordance with Section 2.2 above) and accepted by the
                  Committee.

         (b)      SUBSEQUENT PLAN YEARS. For each succeeding Plan Year, an
                  irrevocable deferral election for that Plan Year, and such
                  other elections as the Committee deems necessary or desirable
                  under the Plan, shall be made by timely delivering to the
                  Committee, in accordance with its rules and procedures, before
                  the end of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year for which the
                  election is made, a new Election Form. If no such Election
                  Form is timely delivered for a Plan Year, the Annual Deferral
                  Amount shall be zero for that Plan Year.

3.4      WITHHOLDING OF ANNUAL DEFERRAL AMOUNTS. For each Plan Year, the Base
         Annual Salary portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld

         amounts, as adjusted from time to time for increases and decreases in
         Base Annual Salary. The Annual Bonus, Commissions, and/or Directors
         Fees portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld at the
         time the Annual Bonus, Commissions, and/or Directors Fees are or
         otherwise would be paid to the Participant, whether or not this occurs

         any amount it desires to that Participant's Company Matching Account,
         which amount shall be for that Participant the Annual Company Matching
         Amount for that Plan Year. The amount so credited to a Participant may
         be smaller or larger than the amount credited to any other Participant,
         and the amount credited to a Participant for a Plan Year may be zero,
         even though one or more other Participants receive an Annual Company
         Matching Amount for that Plan Year. The Annual Company Matching Amount,
         if any, shall be credited as of the last

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>
         day of the Plan Year. If a Participant is not employed by that Employer
         as of the last day of a Plan Year other than by reason of his or her
         Retirement or death while employed, the Annual Company Matching Amount
         for that Plan Year shall be zero.

         Company, and if the Participant had an account balance in the
         Countrywide Credit Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the

         account balance, as determined as of that date, shall be transferred on
         such date to and added to the Participant's Account Balance, and shall
         thereafter be governed by the terms and conditions of this Plan, and
         shall be referred to as the "Rollover Amount." In addition, any
         elections made by the Participant with respect to his or her account
         balance under the CCI Plan shall apply to the Rollover Amount under
         this Plan and any elections made by the Participant with respect to his
         or her annual deferral amount for the plan year of transfer under the
         CCI Plan shall apply to the Participant's Annual Deferral Amount for
         the Plan Year of transfer under this Plan.

         authorized, upon written instructions received from the Committee or

                  daily. The interest rate used to credit the Participant's
                  Account Balance shall be the rate provided for in Subsection
                  (c) below. If a distribution is made under this Plan, the
                  Participant's Account Balance shall be credited with interest
                  until the date on which the distribution is made.

         (b)      INSTALLMENT DISTRIBUTION. If a Participant's Account Balance
                  is to be paid under the Annual Installment Method, such
                  payments shall be determined by amortizing the Participant's
                  Account Balance over the number of years elected, using the
                  interest rate specified in the following sentence. The
                  interest rate to be used to calculate installment payment
                  amounts shall be a fixed interest rate that is determined by
                  averaging the interest rate provided for in Subsection (c)
                  below for the Plan Year in which installment payments commence
                  and the interest rate provided for in Subsection (c) below for
                  the two preceding Plan Years. This rate shall be treated as
                  the nominal rate for making such calculations. If a
                  Participant has completed fewer than three Plan Years, this
                  average shall be determined using the interest rate provided
                  for in Subsection (c) below for the Plan Years during which
                  the Participant participated in the Plan.

         (c)      INTEREST RATE. The rate of interest for a Plan Year shall be
                  determined and announced by the Committee before such Plan
                  Year.

3.10     FICA AND OTHER TAXES. Each Plan Year, the Participant's Employer shall
         determine the amount of FICA and other employment taxes that the
         Employer must withhold for such Participant. The Employer shall
         withhold this amount from that portion of the Participant's Base Annual
         Salary, Annual Bonus and/or Commissions that is not being deferred. If
         necessary, the Committee shall reduce the Annual Deferral Amount in
         order to comply with this Section. In addition, the Participant's
         Employer and/or trustee of the Trust shall withhold from any payments
         made to the Participant under this Plan all federal, state and

                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>
         local income, employment and other taxes required to be withheld in
         connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to be
         determined in the sole discretion of that Employer.

                                   ARTICLE 4
   SHORT-TERM PAYOUT; UNFORESEEABLE FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES; WITHDRAWAL ELECTION

4.1      SHORT-TERM PAYOUT. In connection with each election to defer an Annual
         Deferral Amount, a Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a
         future "Short-Term Payout" from the Plan with respect to all of that
         Annual Deferral Amount. Subject to the Deduction Limitation, the
         Short-Term Payout shall be equal to the Annual Deferral Amount elected
         to be paid as a Short-Term Payout, plus amounts credited in the manner
         provided in Section 3.9 above on that amount. The Short-Term Payout
         amount shall be payable in a lump sum. Subject to the other terms and
         conditions of this Plan, the lump sum payment shall be made, subject to
         the Deduction Limitation, within 60 days after the first day of the
         Plan Year elected by the Participant; provided that no election shall
         be effective unless the Plan Year elected is at least five Plan Years
         after the last day of the Plan Year to which the Annual Deferral Amount
         relates. By way of example, if a Short-Term Payout is elected for
         amounts that are deferred in the Plan Year commencing January 1, 2001,
         the Short-Term Payout can become payable no earlier than the 60 day
         period commencing on January 1, 2006.

4.2      OTHER BENEFITS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER SHORT-TERM. Should an event occur
         that triggers a benefit under Article 5, 6, 7 or 8, any Annual Deferral
         Amount, plus amounts credited thereon, that is subject to a Short-Term
         Payout election under Section 4.1 shall not be paid in accordance with
         Section 4.1 but shall be paid in accordance with the other applicable
         Article.

4.3      WITHDRAWAL PAYOUT/SUSPENSIONS FOR UNFORESEEABLE FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES.
         If the Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency,
         the Participant may petition the Committee to (i) suspend any deferrals
         required to be made by a Participant and/or (ii) receive a partial or
         full payout from the Plan. The payout shall not exceed the lesser of
         the Participant's Account Balance, calculated as if such Participant
         were receiving a Termination Benefit, or the amount reasonably needed
         to satisfy the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency. If, subject to the
         sole discretion of the Committee, the petition for a suspension and/or
         payout is approved, suspension shall take effect upon the date of
         approval and any payout shall be made within 60 days of the date of
         approval. The payment of any amount under this Section shall not be
         subject to the Deduction Limitation.

4.4      WITHDRAWAL ELECTION. A Participant (or, after a Participant's death,
         his or her Beneficiary) may elect, at any time, to withdraw all of his
         or her Account Balance, calculated as if there had occurred a
         Termination of Employment as of the day of the election, less a
         withdrawal penalty equal to 10% of such amount (the net amount shall be
         referred to as the "Withdrawal Amount"). This election can be made at
         any time, before or after Retirement, Disability, death or Termination
         of Employment, and whether or not the Participant (or Beneficiary) is
         in the process of being paid pursuant to an installment payment
         schedule. If made before Retirement, Disability or death, a
         Participant's Withdrawal Amount shall be his or her Account Balance
         calculated as if there had occurred a Termination of Employment as of
         the day of the election. No partial withdrawals of the Withdrawal
         Amount shall be allowed. The Participant (or his or her Beneficiary)
         shall make this election by giving the Committee advance written notice
         of the election in a form determined from time to time by the
         Committee. The Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) shall be paid
         the Withdrawal Amount within 60 days of his or her election. Once the
         Withdrawal Amount is paid, the Participant's participation in the Plan
         shall terminate and the Participant shall not be eligible to
         participate in the Plan again during the remainder of that Plan Year
         and the next three (3) Plan Years. The payment of this Withdrawal
         Amount shall not be subject to the Deduction Limitation.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                               RETIREMENT BENEFIT

5.1      RETIREMENT BENEFIT. Subject to the Deduction Limitation, a Participant
         who Retires shall receive, as a Retirement Benefit, his or her Account
         Balance.

5.2      PAYMENT OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT. A Participant, in connection with his or
         her commencement of participation in the Plan, shall elect on an
         Election Form to receive the Retirement Benefit in a lump sum or
         pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. The
         Participant may annually change his or her election to an allowable
         alternative payout period by submitting a new Election Form to the
         Committee, provided that any such Election Form is submitted at least
         one year prior to the Participant's Retirement and is accepted by the
         Committee in its sole discretion. The Election Form most recently
         accepted by the Committee shall govern the payout of the Retirement
         Benefit. If a Participant does not make any election with respect to
         the payment of the Retirement Benefit, then such benefit shall be
         payable in a lump sum. The lump sum payment shall be made, or
         installment payments shall commence, no later than 60 days after the
         date the Participant Retires. Any payment made shall be subject to the
         Deduction Limitation.

<PAGE>
5.3      DEATH PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT. If a Participant dies
         after Retirement but before the Retirement Benefit is paid in full, the
         Participant's unpaid Retirement Benefit payments shall continue and
         shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary (a) over the remaining
         number of months and in the same amounts as that benefit would have
         been paid to the Participant had the Participant survived, or (b) in a
         lump sum, if requested by the Beneficiary and allowed in the sole
         discretion of the Committee, that is equal to the Participant's unpaid
         remaining Account Balance.

                                   ARTICLE 6
                         PRE-RETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFIT

6.1      PRE-RETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFIT. Subject to the Deduction Limitation,
         the Participant's Beneficiary shall receive a Pre-Retirement Survivor
         Benefit equal to the Participant's Account Balance if the Participant
         dies before he or she Retires, experiences a Termination of Employment
         or suffers a Disability.

6.2      PAYMENT OF PRE-RETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFIT. A Participant, in
         connection with his or her commencement of participation in the Plan,
         shall elect on an Election Form whether the Pre-Retirement Survivor
         Benefit shall be received by his or her Beneficiary in a lump sum or
         pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. The
         Participant may annually change this election to an allowable
         alternative payout period by submitting a new Election Form to the
         Committee, which form must be accepted by the Committee in its sole
         discretion. The Election Form most recently accepted by the Committee
         prior to the Participant's death shall govern the payout of the
         Participant's Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. If a Participant does
         not make any election with respect to the payment of the Pre-Retirement
         Survivor Benefit, then such benefit shall be paid in a lump sum.
         Despite the foregoing, if the Participant's Account Balance at the time
         of his or her death is less than $25,000, payment of the Pre-Retirement
         Survivor Benefit may be made, in the sole discretion of the Committee,
         in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of not more
         than 5 years. The lump sum payment shall be made, or installment
         payments shall commence, no later than 60 days after the date the
         Committee is provided with proof that is satisfactory to the Committee
         of the Participant's death. Any payment made shall be subject to the
         Deduction Limitation.

                               TERMINATION BENEFIT

7.1      TERMINATION BENEFIT. Subject to the Deduction Limitation, the
         Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit, which shall be equal
         to the Participant's Account Balance.

                                     - 16 -

7.2      PAYMENT OF TERMINATION BENEFIT. If the Participant's Account Balance at
         the time of his or her Termination of Employment is less than $25,000,
         payment of his or her Termination Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum.
         If his or her Account Balance at such time is equal to or greater than
         that amount, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause the
         Termination Benefit to be paid in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual
         Installment Method of not more than fifteen (15) years. The lump sum
         payment shall be made, or installment payments shall commence, no later
         than 60 days after the date the date of the Participant's Termination
         of Employment. Any payment made shall be subject to the Deduction
         Limitation.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                          DISABILITY WAIVER AND BENEFIT

8.1      DISABILITY WAIVER:

         (a)      WAIVER OF DEFERRAL. A Participant who is determined by the
                  Committee to be suffering from a Disability shall be excused
                  from fulfilling that portion of the Annual Deferral Amount
                  commitment that would otherwise have been withheld from a
                  Participant's Base Annual Salary, Annual Bonus, Commissions
                  and/or Directors Fees for the Plan Year during which the
                  Participant first suffers a Disability. During the period of
                  Disability, the Participant shall not be allowed to make any
                  additional deferral elections, but will continue to be
                  considered a Participant for all other purposes of this Plan.

         (b)      RETURN TO WORK. If a Participant returns to employment or
                  service as a Director, with any Employer after a Disability
                  ceases, the Participant may elect to defer an Annual Deferral
                  Amount for the Plan Year following his or her return to
                  employment or service and for every Plan Year thereafter while
                  a Participant in the Plan; provided such deferral elections
                  are otherwise allowed and an Election Form is delivered to and
                  accepted by the Committee for each such election in accordance
                  with Section 3.3 above.

8.2      CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY; DISABILITY BENEFIT. A Participant suffering a
         Disability shall, for benefit purposes under this Plan, continue to be
         considered to be employed or in the service of an Employer as a
         Director, and shall be eligible for the benefits provided for in
         Articles 4, 5, 6 or 7 in accordance with the provisions of those
         Articles. Notwithstanding the above, the Committee shall have the right
         to, in its sole and absolute discretion and for purposes of this Plan
         only, and must in the case of a Participant who is otherwise eligible
         to Retire, deem the Participant to have experienced a Termination of
         Employment, or in the case of a Participant who is eligible to Retire,
         to have Retired, at any time

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>
         (or in the case of a Participant who is eligible to Retire, as soon as
         practicable) after such Participant is determined to be suffering a
         Disability, in which case the Participant shall receive a Disability
         Benefit equal to his or her Account Balance at the time of the
         Committee's determination; provided, however, that should the
         Participant otherwise have been eligible to Retire, he or she shall be
         paid in accordance with Article 5. The Disability Benefit shall be paid
         in a lump sum or, upon a Participant's request and in the Committee's
         sole discretion, installment payments over not more than 5 years. The
         lump sum payment shall be made, or installment payments shall commence,
         within 60 days of the Committee's exercise of its right to deem a
         Participant to have experienced a Termination of Employment. Any
         payment made shall be subject to the Deduction Limitation.

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

9.1      BENEFICIARY. Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to
         designate his or her Beneficiary(ies) (both primary as well as
         contingent) to receive any benefits payable under the Plan to a
         beneficiary upon the death of a Participant. The Beneficiary designated
         under this Plan may be the same as or different from the Beneficiary
         designation under any other plan of the Participant's Employer in which
         the Participant participates.

9.2      BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION; CHANGE; SPOUSAL CONSENT. A Participant shall
         designate his or her Beneficiary by completing and signing the
         Beneficiary Designation Form, and returning it to the Committee or its
         designated agent. A Participant shall have the right to change a
         Beneficiary by completing, signing and otherwise complying with the
         terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and the Committee's rules and
         procedures, as in effect from time to time. If the Participant names
         someone other than his or her spouse as a Beneficiary, a spousal
         consent, in the form designated by the Committee, must be signed by
         that Participant's spouse and returned to the Committee. Upon the
         acceptance by the Committee of a new Beneficiary Designation Form, all
         Beneficiary designations previously filed shall be canceled. The
         Committee shall be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary Designation
         Form filed by the Participant and accepted by the Committee prior to
         his or her death.

9.3      ACKNOWLEDGMENT. No designation or change in designation of a
         Beneficiary shall be effective until received, accepted and
         acknowledged in writing by the Committee or its designated agent.

9.4      NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION. If a Participant fails to designate a
         Beneficiary as provided in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 above or, if all
         designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to
         complete distribution of the

                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>
         Participant's benefits, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary
         shall be deemed to be his or her surviving spouse. If the Participant
         has no surviving spouse, the benefits remaining under the Plan to be
         paid to a Beneficiary shall be payable to the executor or personal
         representative of the Participant's estate.

9.5      DOUBT AS TO BENEFICIARY. If the Committee has any doubt as to the
         proper Beneficiary to receive payments pursuant to this Plan, the
         Committee shall have the right, exercisable in its discretion, to cause
         the Participant's Employer to withhold such payments until this matter
         is resolved to the Committee's satisfaction.

9.6      DISCHARGE OF OBLIGATIONS. The payment of benefits under the Plan to a
         Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge all Employers and the
         Committee from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to
         the Participant, and that Participant's Plan Agreement(s) shall
         terminate upon such full payment of benefits.

                                LEAVE OF ABSENCE

10.1     PAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE. If a Participant is authorized by the
         Participant's Employer for any reason to take a paid leave of absence
         from the employment of the Employer, the Participant shall continue to
         be considered employed by that Employer and the Annual Deferral Amount
         shall continue to be withheld during such paid leave of absence in
         accordance with Section 3.3.

10.2     UNPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE. If a Participant is authorized by the
         Participant's Employer for any reason to take an unpaid leave of
         absence from the employment of the Employer, the Participant shall
         continue to be considered employed by that Employer and the Participant
         shall be excused from making deferrals until the earlier of the date
         the leave of absence expires or the Participant returns to a paid
         employment status. Upon such expiration or return, deferrals shall
         resume for the remaining portion of the Plan Year in which the
         expiration or return occurs, based on the deferral election, if any,
         made for that Plan Year. If no election was made for that Plan Year, no
         deferral shall be withheld.

                     TERMINATION, AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION

11.1     TERMINATION. Each Employer reserves the right to discontinue its
         sponsorship of the Plan and/or to terminate the Plan at any time with
         respect to any or all of its participating Employees and Directors by
         action of its board of directors. Upon the termination of the Plan with
         respect to any Employer, the Plan

         Agreements of the affected Participants who are employed by that
         Employer or in the service of that Employer as a Director, shall
         terminate and their Account Balances, determined as if they had
         experienced a Termination of Employment on the date of Plan termination
         or, if Plan termination occurs after the date upon which a Participant
         was eligible to Retire, then with respect to that Participant as if he
         or she had Retired on the date of Plan termination, shall be paid to
         the Participants as follows: (a) prior to a Change in Control: (i) if
         the Plan is terminated with respect to all of its Participants, the
         Employer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and
         notwithstanding any elections made by the Participant, to pay such
         benefits in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of
         up to 15 years, with amounts credited during the installment period as
         provided herein; (ii) if the Plan is terminated with respect to less
         than all of its Participants, the Employer shall be required to pay
         such benefits in a lump sum; (b) after a Change in Control, the
         Employer shall be required to pay such benefits in a lump sum. The
         termination of the Plan shall not adversely affect any Participant or
         Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of any benefits
         under the Plan as of the date of termination; provided, however, that
         the Employer shall have the right to accelerate installment payments
         without a premium or prepayment penalty by paying the Account Balance
         in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method using fewer
         years (provided that the present value of all payments that will have
         been received by a Participant at any given point of time under the
         different payment schedule shall equal or exceed the present value of
         all payments that would have been received at that point in time under
         the original payment schedule). The applicable interest rate to be used
         as the discount rate for determining such present value shall be a
         reasonable discount rate selected by the Committee from time to time.

11.2     AMENDMENT. Any Employer may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in
         whole or in part with respect to that Employer by the action of its
         board of directors; provided, however, that no amendment or
         modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a
         Participant's Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or
         modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had experienced
         a Termination of Employment as of the effective date of the amendment
         or modification or, if the amendment or modification occurs after the
         date upon which the Participant was eligible to Retire, the Participant
         had Retired as of the effective date of the amendment or modification.
         The amendment or modification of the Plan shall not affect any
         Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of
         benefits under the Plan as of the date of the amendment or
         modification; provided, however, that the Employer shall have the right
         to accelerate installment payments by paying the Account Balance in a
         lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method using fewer years
         (provided that the present value

                                      - 20 -
<PAGE>
         of all payments that will have been received by a Participant at any
         given point of time under the different payment schedule shall equal or
         exceed the present value of all payments that would have been received
         at that point in time under the original payment schedule, using a
         reasonable discount rate selected by the Committee from time to time).

11.3     PLAN AGREEMENT. Despite the provisions of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 above,
         if a Participant's Plan Agreement contains benefits or limitations that
         are not in this Plan document, the Participant's Employer may only
         amend or terminate such provisions with the consent of the Participant.

11.4     EFFECT OF PAYMENT. The full payment of the applicable benefit under
         Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of the Plan shall completely discharge all
         obligations to a Participant and his or her designated Beneficiaries
         under this Plan and the Participant's Plan Agreement shall terminate.

                                 ADMINISTRATION

12.1     COMMITTEE DUTIES. This Plan shall be administered by a Committee, which
         shall consist of the Board, or such committee as the Board shall
         appoint. Members of the Committee may be Participants under this Plan.
         The Committee shall also have the discretion and authority to (i) make,
         amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for
         the administration of this Plan and (ii) decide or resolve any and all
         questions including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in
         connection with the Plan. Any individual serving on the Committee who
         is a Participant shall not vote or act on any matter relating solely to
         himself or herself. When making a determination or calculation, the
         Committee shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a
         Participant or the Company.

12.2     AGENTS. In the administration of this Plan, the Committee may, from
         time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative
         duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed
         representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel who may
         be counsel to any Employer.

12.3     BINDING EFFECT OF DECISIONS. The decision or action of the Committee
         with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the
         administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the
         rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and
         conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the
         Plan.

12.4     INDEMNITY OF COMMITTEE. All Employers shall indemnify and hold harmless
         the members of the Committee, and any Employee to whom the duties of
         the

                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>
         Committee may be delegated, against any and all claims, losses,
         damages, expenses or liabilities arising from any action or failure to
         act with respect to this Plan, except in the case of willful misconduct
         by the Committee or any of its members or any such Employee.

12.5     EMPLOYER INFORMATION. To enable the Committee to perform its functions,
         each Employer shall supply full and timely information to the Committee
         on all matters relating to the compensation of its Participants, the
         date and circumstances of the Retirement, Disability, death or
         Termination of Employment of its Participants, and such other pertinent
         information as the Committee may reasonably require.

                          OTHER BENEFITS AND AGREEMENTS

13.1     COORDINATION WITH OTHER BENEFITS. The benefits provided for a
         Participant and Participant's Beneficiary under the Plan are in
         addition to any other benefits available to such Participant under any
         other plan or program for employees of the Participant's Employer. The
         Plan shall supplement and shall not supersede, modify or amend any
         other such plan or program except as may otherwise be expressly
         provided.

                                   ARTICLE 14
                                CLAIMS PROCEDURES

14.1     PRESENTATION OF CLAIM. Any Participant or Beneficiary of a deceased
         Participant (such Participant or Beneficiary being referred to below as
         a "Claimant") may deliver to the Committee a written claim for a
         determination with respect to the amounts distributable to such
         Claimant from the Plan. If such a claim relates to the contents of a
         notice received by the Claimant, the claim must be made within 60 days
         after such notice was received by the Claimant. All other claims must
         be made within 180 days of the date on which the event that caused the
         claim to arise occurred. The claim must state with particularity the
         determination desired by the Claimant.

14.2     NOTIFICATION OF DECISION. The Committee shall consider a Claimant's
         claim within a reasonable time, and shall notify the
         Claimant in writing:

         (a)      that the Claimant's requested determination has been made, and
                  that the claim has been allowed in full; or

         (b)      that the Committee has reached a conclusion contrary, in whole
                  or in part, to the Claimant's requested determination, and
                  such notice must set forth in a manner calculated to be
                  understood by the Claimant:

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>
                  (i)      the specific reason(s) for the denial of the claim,
                           or any part of it;

                  (ii)     specific reference(s) to pertinent provisions of the
                           Plan upon which such denial was based;

                  (iii)    a description of any additional material or
                           information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the
                           claim, and an explanation of why such material or
                           information is necessary; and

                  (iv)     an explanation of the claim review procedure set
                           forth in Section 14.3 below.

14.3     REVIEW OF A DENIED CLAIM. Within 60 days after receiving a notice from
         the Committee that a claim has been denied, in whole or in part, a
         Claimant (or the Claimant's duly authorized representative) may file
         with the Committee a written request for a review of the denial of the
         claim. Thereafter, but not later than 30 days after the review
         procedure began, the Claimant (or the Claimant's duly authorized
         representative):

         (a)      may review pertinent documents;

         (b)      may submit written comments or other documents; and/or

         (c)      may request a hearing, which the Committee, in its sole
                  discretion, may grant.

14.4     DECISION ON REVIEW. The Committee shall render its decision on review
         promptly, and not later than 60 days after the filing of a written
         request for review of the denial, unless a hearing is held or other
         special circumstances require additional time, in which case the
         Committee's decision must be rendered within 120 days after such date.
         Such decision must be written in a manner calculated to be understood
         by the Claimant, and it must contain:

         (a)      specific reasons for the decision;

         (b)      specific reference(s) to the pertinent Plan provisions upon
                  which the decision was based; and

         (c)      such other matters as the Committee deems relevant.

14.5     LEGAL ACTION. A Claimant's compliance with the foregoing provisions of
         this Article 14 is a mandatory prerequisite to a Claimant's right to
         commence any legal action with respect to any claim for benefits under
         this Plan.

                                      TRUST

15.1     ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUST. The Company established the Trust, and each
         Employer may transfer over to the Trust such assets as the Employer
         determines, in its sole discretion.

15.2     INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE PLAN AND THE TRUST. The provisions of the Plan
         and the Plan Agreement shall govern the rights of a Participant to
         receive distributions pursuant to the Plan. The provisions of the Trust
         shall govern the rights of the Employers, Participants and the
         creditors of the Employers to the assets transferred to the Trust. Each
         Employer shall at all times remain liable to carry out its obligations
         under the Plan.

15.3     DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TRUST. Each Employer's obligations under the
         Plan may be satisfied with Trust assets distributed pursuant to the
         terms of the Trust, and any such distribution shall reduce the
         Employer's obligations under this Plan.

                                   ARTICLE 16
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

16.1     STATUS OF PLAN. The Plan is intended to be a plan that is not qualified
         within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) and that "is unfunded and is
         maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing
         deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
         compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2),
         301(a)(3) and 40l(a)(1). The Plan shall be administered and interpreted
         to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.

16.2     UNSECURED GENERAL CREDITOR. Participants and their Beneficiaries,
         heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights,
         interests or claims in any property or assets of any Employer. For
         purposes of the payment of benefits under this Plan, any and all of an
         Employer's assets shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged assets
         of that Employer. An Employer's obligation under the Plan shall be
         merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the
         future.

16.3     EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY. If an Employer enters into a Plan Agreement with
         a Participant, then only that Employer shall be liable for the benefits
         that the Participant earns during the time that the Plan Agreement is
         in effect with that Employer. The other Employers shall not be liable
         for any of the benefits that the Participant earns during this period.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, only the Company (and not Bancorp) shall
         be liable for the benefits that the

                                     - 24 -
<PAGE>
         participants of the INMC Mortgage Holding, Inc. Deferred Compensation
         Plan earned under such plan prior to January 1, 2001.

16.4     NONASSIGNABILITY. Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have
         any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate,
         mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or
         convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable
         hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are
         expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of
         the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to
         seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of
         any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a
         Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in
         the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or
         insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property
         settlement or otherwise.

16.5     NOT A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT. The terms and conditions of this Plan
         shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between any
         Employer and a Participant. Such employment is hereby acknowledged to
         be an "at will" employment relationship that can be terminated at any
         time for any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or
         without notice, unless expressly provided in a written employment
         agreement. Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant
         the right to be retained in the service of any Employer as an Employee
         or a Director, or to interfere with the right of any Employer to
         discipline or discharge the Participant at any time.

16.6     FURNISHING INFORMATION. A Participant or his or her Beneficiary will
         cooperate with the Committee by furnishing any and all information
         requested by the Committee and take such other actions as may be
         requested in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and the
         payments of benefits hereunder, including but not limited to taking
         such physical examinations as the Committee may deem necessary.

16.7     TERMS. Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall
         be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where
         they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the
         singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were
         used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases
         where they would so apply.

16.8     CAPTIONS. The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of this
         Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the
         meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

                                     - 25 -

16.9     GOVERNING LAW. Subject to ERISA, the provisions of this Plan shall be
         construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State
         of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

16.10    NOTICE. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the
         Committee under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and
         hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address
         below:

                           Committee DCP
                           IndyMac Bank, F.S.B.
                           155 N. Lake Avenue
                           Pasadena, CA 91101

         Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if
         delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the
         receipt for registration or certification.

         Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant
         under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered,
         or sent by mail, to the last known address of the Participant.

16.11    SUCCESSORS. The provisions of this Plan shall bind and inure to the
         benefit of the Participant's Employer and its successors and assigns
         and the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiaries.

16.12    SPOUSE'S INTEREST. The interest in the benefits hereunder of a spouse
         of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant shall
         automatically pass to the Participant and shall not be transferable by
         such spouse in any manner, including but not limited to such spouse's
         will, nor shall such interest pass under the laws of intestate
         succession.

16.13    VALIDITY. In case any provision of this Plan shall be illegal or
         invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect
         the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and
         enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been
         inserted herein.

16.14    INCOMPETENT. If the Committee determines in its discretion that a
         benefit under this Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared
         incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of
         that person's property, the Committee may direct payment of such
         benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care
         and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable person. The
         Committee may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or
         guardianship, as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the
         benefit. Any payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of
         the

                                     - 26 -
<PAGE>
         Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, and
         shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such
         payment amount.

16.15    COURT ORDER. The Committee is authorized to make any payments directed
         by court order in any action in which the Plan or the Committee has
         been named as a party. In addition, if a court determines that a spouse
         or former spouse of a Participant has an interest in the Participant's
         benefits under the Plan in connection with a property settlement or
         otherwise, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the right,
         notwithstanding any election made by a Participant, to immediately
         distribute the spouse's or former spouse's interest in the
         Participant's benefits under the Plan to that spouse or former spouse.

16.16    DISTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF TAXATION:

         (a)      IN GENERAL. If, for any reason, all or any portion of a
                  Participant's benefits under this Plan becomes taxable to the
                  Participant prior to receipt, a Participant may petition the
                  Committee before a Change in Control, or the trustees of the
                  Trust after a Change in Control, for a distribution of that
                  portion of his or her benefit that has become taxable. Upon
                  the grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld (and, after a Change in Control, shall
                  be granted), a Participant's Employer shall distribute to the
                  Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to
                  the taxable portion of his or her benefit (which amount shall
                  not exceed a Participant's unpaid Account Balance under the
                  Plan). If the petition is granted, the tax liability
                  distribution shall be made within 90 days of the date when the
                  Participant's petition is granted. Such a distribution shall
                  affect and reduce the benefits to be paid under this Plan.

         (b)      TRUST. If the Trust terminates in accordance with Section
                  3.6(e) of the Trust and benefits are distributed from the
                  Trust to a Participant in accordance with that Section, the
                  Participant's benefits under this Plan shall be reduced to the
                  extent of such distributions.

16.17    INSURANCE. The Employers, on their own behalf or on behalf of the
         trustees of the Trust, and, in their sole discretion, may apply for and
         procure insurance on the life of the Participant, in such amounts and
         in such forms as the Trust may choose. The Employers or the trustees of
         the Trust, as the case may be, shall be the sole owner and beneficiary
         of any such insurance. The Participant shall have no interest
         whatsoever in any such policy or policies, and at the request of the
         Employers shall submit to medical examinations and supply such
         information and execute such documents as may be required by the
         insurance company or companies to whom the Employers have applied for
         insurance.

16.18    LEGAL FEES TO ENFORCE RIGHTS AFTER CHANGE IN CONTROL. The Company and
         each Employer is aware that upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,
         the Board or the board of directors of a Participant's Employer (which
         might then be composed of new members) or a shareholder of the Company
         or the Participant's Employer, or of any successor corporation might
         then cause or attempt to cause the Company, the Participant's Employer
         or such successor to refuse to comply with its obligations under the
         Plan and might cause or attempt to cause the Company or the
         Participant's Employer to institute, or may institute, litigation
         seeking to deny Participants the benefits intended under the Plan. In
         these circumstances, the purpose of the Plan could be frustrated.
         Accordingly, if, following a Change in Control, it should appear to any
