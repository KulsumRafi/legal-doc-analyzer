<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Hilton Hotels Corporation (the "Company") maintains the Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan (the "Plan"); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Appendix&nbsp;G of the Plan is adopted to reflect certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA'). This
Appendix&nbsp;G is intended as good-faith compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Appendix&nbsp;G shall be effective as of the first day of the first Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2001. This Appendix&nbsp;G shall supersede the provisions of
the Plan to the extent those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this Appendix&nbsp;G. Capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan, unless otherwise provided
herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>SECTION
A. LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
date. This Section shall be effective for limitation years ending after December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect
on Participants. Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of Section&nbsp;415(b) of the Code will be provided to those Participants
specified below. </FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defined
benefit dollar limitation. The "defined benefit dollar limitation' under Section&nbsp;5.1(a) of the Plan is $160,000, as adjusted, effective January&nbsp;1
of each year, under Section&nbsp;415(d) of the Code in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted under
Section&nbsp;415(d) will apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum
permissible benefit: The "maximum permissible benefit' is the lesser of the defined benefit dollar limitation or the defined benefit compensation limitation
under Section&nbsp;5.1(b) of the Plan (both adjusted where required, as provided in (a)&nbsp;below and, if applicable, in (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;below). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Participant has fewer than 10&nbsp;years of participation in the Plan, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i)&nbsp;the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the Plan and (ii)&nbsp;the denominator of which is 10. In the case of a Participant who has fewer than 10&nbsp;years
of service with the employer, the defined benefit Compensation limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i)&nbsp;the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of service with
the employer and (ii)&nbsp;the denominator of which is 10. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit
payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age 62 (adjusted
under (a)&nbsp;above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the
defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Appendix&nbsp;A, Section&nbsp;A.1 of the Plan for non-lump
sum benefits and (ii)&nbsp;the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a 5&nbsp;percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table as
defined in Appendix&nbsp;A, Section&nbsp;A.1 of the Plan for lump sum benefits, or Section&nbsp;E of this Appendix&nbsp;G, as applicable. Any decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation
determined in accordance with this paragraph&nbsp;(b) shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon
death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the benefit of a Participant begins after the Participant attains age 65, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at the later age is the
annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age 65
(adjusted under (a)&nbsp;above, if required). The actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age after age 65 is determined as the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the
actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Appendix&nbsp;A,
Section&nbsp;A.1 of the Plan for non-lump sum benefits and (ii)&nbsp;the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a 5&nbsp;percent
interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in Appendix&nbsp;A, Section&nbsp;A.1 of the Plan for lump sum benefits, or Section&nbsp;E of this Appendix&nbsp;G, as
applicable. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall be ignored. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefit
increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of Section&nbsp;415(b) of the Code under the forgoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;A shall be
provided to all Employees participating in the Plan who have one Hour of Service on or after the first day of the first limitation year ending after December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

B. INCREASE IN COMPENSATION LIMIT </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase
in limit. The annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining benefit accruals in any Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31,
2001, shall not exceed $200,000. Annual Compensation means Compensation during the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined under
the Plan (the determination period). For purposes of determining benefit accruals in a Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2001, Compensation for any prior determination period shall be
limited as provided below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost-of-living
adjustment. The $200,000 limit on annual Compensation in paragraph&nbsp;1 shall be adjusted for

Employee. Key Employee means any Employee or former Employee (including any deceased Employee) who at any time during the Plan Year that includes the determination
date was an officer of a Company having annual compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under Section&nbsp;416(i)(1) of the Code for Plan Years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2002), a
5-percent owner of a Company, or a 1-percent owner of a Company having annual Compensation of more than $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation means compensation
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;415(c)(3) of the Code. The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable
Regulations and other guidance of general applicability issued thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination
of present values and amounts. This Section&nbsp;2.2 shall apply for purposes of determining the present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of
account balances of Employees as of the determination date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions

of the determination date shall be increased by the distributions made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any Plan aggregated with the Plan under Section&nbsp;416(g)(2) of the Code
during the 1-year period ending on the determination date. The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated Plan which, had it not been terminated, would have
been aggregated with the Plan under Section&nbsp;416(g)(2)(A)(i)&nbsp;of the Code. In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death, or disability, this
provision shall be applied by substituting "5-year period' for "1-year period.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees
not performing services during year ending on the determination date. The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not

a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such Plan from this Plan. The definition of

For Annuity Distributions That Commence During Participant's Lifetime. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint
Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary Is Not the Participant's Spouse. If the Participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor
annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the
Participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in
Q&amp;A-2 of Section&nbsp;1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury Regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and
a nonspouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the
period certain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Period
Certain Annuities. Unless the Participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the
period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution
period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section&nbsp;1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting
date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the Participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the
Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section&nbsp;1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the Participant as of the Participant's birthday in the
year that contains the annuity starting date. If the Participant's spouse is the Participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the
period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this Section&nbsp;4.2, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the
Participant and the Participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section&nbsp;1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the
Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. </FONT></P>
