         <B><U>"Transferability</U>.</B>  Unless the Option Document (or an amendment thereto authorized by the Committee) expressly states that
the Option is transferable as provided hereunder, no Option granted under this Plan, nor any interest in such Option, may be sold,
assigned, conveyed, gifted, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred in any manner prior to the vesting or lapse of any and all
restrictions applicable thereto, other than pursuant to the beneficiary designation form described in Section 7.2 hereof, by will or
the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in the Code or Title 1 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  With respect to an Option that is not intended to qualify as an ISO,
the Committee may grant such Option or amend such an outstanding Option to provide that the Option is transferable or assignable to a
member or members of the Participant's "immediate family," as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(e) under the Exchange Act, or to a
trust for the benefit solely of a member or members of the Participant's immediate family, or to a partnership or other entity whose
only owners are members of the Participant's immediate family; <U>provided</U> the instrument of transfer is approved by the Company's
 Administrative Committee of Employee Benefits (the "Administrative Committee"), Options so transferred are not again transferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Following any such transfer or assignment the Option will remain
subject to substantially the same terms applicable to the Option while held by the Participant, as modified as the Committee shall
determine appropriate, and the transferee shall execute an agreement agreeing to be bound by such terms."

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has caused this Amendment to be signed by its duly authorized officer as
of this 3rd day of December, 2002. </FONT></P>
