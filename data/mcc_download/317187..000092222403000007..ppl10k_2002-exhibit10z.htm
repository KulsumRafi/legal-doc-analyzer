<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of February
  1, 2003 (the "Agreement") between the LEHIGH COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY
  (the "Issuer") and PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES CORPORATION (the "Company").</P>

    <p align="justify"><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Background,
      Representations and Findings</b></p>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Background</U>.
    </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Issuer is a public instrumentality of the
  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Commonwealth") and a body corporate and politic
  organized and existing pursuant to the Economic Development Financing Law (the
  "Act"). Under the Act, the Issuer is authorized, among other things, to make
  loans to any "project applicant" or "project user" (each as defined in the Act)
  in order to pay or provide for the financing or refinancing of costs of pollution
  control facilities. The Company (formerly known as Pennsylvania Power &amp;
  Light Company) has heretofore requested the Issuer to undertake the financing
  of certain air or water pollution control facilities or sewage or solid waste
  disposal facilities (collectively, the "Project Facilities"), which are more
  fully described in Exhibit A hereto and the Issuer issued $90,000,000 aggregate
  principal amount of its Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 1992 Series
  A (Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company Project) (the "Prior Bonds") for such
  purposes pursuant to a Trust Indenture dated as of May 1, 1973, as previously
  supplemented and as supplemented by a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as
  of November 1, 1992 (as supplemented, the "Existing Indenture"), between the
  Authority and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor
  trustee (the "Prior Trustee").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds of the Prior Bonds were loaned
  to the Company pursuant to the terms of a Pollution Control Financing Agreement
  dated as of May 1, 1973 (the "Existing Agreement") between the Issuer and the
  Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has sold the Sunbury Station and
  the related Project Facilities to an unrelated third party and transferred its
  interest in the remaining Project Facilities to indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
  of PPL Energy Supply, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate
  of the Company (&quot;PPL Energy Supply&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has requested that the Issuer refund
  the Prior Bonds; in order to pay a portion of the cost of refunding the Prior
  Bonds, the Issuer has agreed to issue $90,000,000 aggregate principal amount
  of Lehigh County Industrial Development Authority Pollution Control Revenue
  Refunding Bonds, Series 2003 (PPL Electric Utilities Corporation Project) (the
  "Bonds") on the terms and conditions set forth in the subsequent sections of
  this Agreement.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Company
      Representations. The Company represents that:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a corporation duly organized and existing
  under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with full power and legal
  right to enter into this Agreement and the Note and the Senior Secured Bonds
  (as defined below) and perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
  making and performance of this Agreement, the Note and the Senior Secured Bonds
  on the part of the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary action.
  This Agreement, the Note and the Senior Secured Bonds have been duly executed
  and delivered by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations
  of the Company enforceable in accordance with their respective terms except
  as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
  transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
  the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, to general equitable principles
  (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and to an implied covenant
  of good faith and fair dealing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project Facilities constitute pollution
  control facilities as defined in the Act and are consistent with the purposes
  of the Act.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used
  directly or indirectly to acquire land or any interest therein or for the acquisition
  of any property or interest therein unless the first use of such property was
  pursuant to such acquisition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) All of the proceeds of the Prior Bonds were
  used to refund $20,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue
  Bonds, 1980 Series B (Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company Project) (the "1980B
  Bonds") and $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue
  Refunding Bonds, 1982 Series A (Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company Project)
  (the "1982A Bonds", and together with the 1980B Bonds, the "Project Bonds")
  and (ii) at least 90% of the proceeds of the Project Bonds were issued to provide
  "pollution control facilities" and "solid waste disposal facilities" within
  the meaning of Sections 103(b)(4)(E) and (F) of the Internal Revenue Code of
  1954, as amended, and in effect prior to the passage of the Tax Reform Act of
  1986 (the "1954 Code").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used
  to provide working capital.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the proceeds of the Project Bonds were
  used, and none of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used, to provide any airplane,
  skybox or other private luxury box, or health club facility; any facility primarily
  used for gambling; or any store the principal business of which is the sale
  of alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prior Bonds were issued on November&nbsp;24,
  1992.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisition, construction and installation of
  the Project Facilities has been accomplished.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries
  have used or operated the Project Facilities in a manner consistent with the
  purposes of the Project Facilities and the Act and the Company knows of no reason
  why the Project Facilities will not be so operated. With respect to the Project
  Facilities related to Sunbury Station that the Company sold to an unrelated
  third party, the Company used or operated such Project Facilities when it owned
  them in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Project Facilities and
  the Act and the Company knows of no reason why such Project Facilities will
  not be so operated by any owner of the Sunbury Station.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Prior Bonds nor the Bonds are or
  will be "federally guaranteed", as defined in Section 149(b) of the Internal
  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"; references to the Code and Sections
  of the Code (or, as applicable, to the 1954 Code and Sections thereof) include
  Sections 1312 and 1313 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, relevant applicable regulations
  and proposed regulations thereunder and under the 1954 Code and any successor
  provisions to those Sections, regulations or proposed regulations and, in addition,
  all applicable official rulings and judicial determinations under the foregoing
  applicable to the Prior Bonds or the Bonds, as applicable).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time will any funds constituting gross
  proceeds of the Bonds be used in a manner as would constitute failure of compliance
  with Section 148 of the Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the proceeds (within the meaning of
  Section 147(g) of the Code) of the Bonds will be used to pay for any costs of
  issuance of the Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds derived from the sale of the Bonds
  (other than any accrued interest thereon) will be used exclusively to refund
  the outstanding principal amount of the Prior Bonds. The principal amount of
  the Bonds does not exceed the outstanding principal amount of the Prior Bonds.
  The redemption of the outstanding principal amount of the Prior Bonds with such
  proceeds of the Bonds will occur not later than 90 days after the date of issuance
  of the Bonds. All earnings derived from the investment of such proceeds of the
  Bonds will be fully needed and used on such redemption date to pay a portion
  of the redemption premium and interest accrued and payable on the Prior Bonds
  on such date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;On the date of issuance and delivery of the
  Prior Bonds, the Company reasonably expected that all of the proceeds of such
  Prior Bonds would be used to carry out the governmental purposes of such issue
  within the three-year period beginning on the date such issue was issued and
  none of the proceeds of such issue, if any, were invested in nonpurpose investments
  having a substantially guaranteed yield for three years or more.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(o)&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the average maturity of the Prior Bonds
  nor the average maturity of the Bonds exceeds 120% of the average reasonably
  expected economic lives of the facilities financed or refinanced by the proceeds
  of the Bonds (determined under Section 147(b) of the Code).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(p)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not anticipated, as of the date hereof,
  that there will be created any "replacement proceeds", within the meaning of
  Section 1.148-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations, with respect to the Bonds; however,
  in the event that any such replacement proceeds are deemed to have been created,
  such amounts will be invested in compliance with Section 148 of the Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(q)&nbsp;&nbsp;The information furnished by the Company and
  used by the Issuer in preparing the certification pursuant to Section 148 and
  in preparing the Form 8038 information statement pursuant to Section 149(e)
  of the Code was accurate and complete as of the date of issuance of the Prior
  Bonds, and the information furnished by the Company and used by the Issuer in
  preparing the certification pursuant to Section 148 of the Code and in preparing
  the Form 8038 information statement pursuant to Section 149(e) of the Code will
  be accurate and complete as of the date of issuance of the Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(r)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not own or operate any of the
  Project Facilities. Each affiliate of the Company that owns Project Facilities
  has agreed with the Company that, for so long as such affiliate owns any of
  the Project Facilities, it will operate such Project Facilities in a manner
  consistent with the Company's tax covenants in this Agreement and the other
  transaction documents relating to the issuance of the Bonds. Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, nothing in any such agreement with any such affiliate requires,
  and nothing in this Agreement shall require, the Company or any such affiliate
  to operate any portion of the Project Facilities, or prevents any such affiliates
  from selling all or any portion of the Project Facilities, or from merging or
  consolidating with another entity. Nothing in this Agreement shall bind any
  affiliate of the Company that owns the Project Facilities or any portion thereof,
  or any purchasers of any portions of the Project Facilities or portions thereof
  sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Issuer
  Findings and Representations.</U> The Issuer hereby confirms its findings and
  represents that:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project Facilities qualify as "pollution
  control facilities" for purposes of the Act and promote the public purposes
  of the Act by maintaining employment and alleviating unemployment in the Commonwealth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project Facilities promote the health, safety
  and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth by reducing air, water
  and other pollution and contamination and permitting additional generation of
  electric energy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Issuer has the necessary power under the
  Act, and has duly taken all action on its part required, to execute and deliver
  this Agreement and to undertake the refunding of the Prior Bonds through the
  issuance of the Bonds. The execution and performance of this Agreement by the
  Issuer will not violate or conflict with any instrument by which the Issuer
  or its properties are bound.</P>


    <p align="justify"><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refunding
      the Prior Bonds</b></P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Issuance
  of Bonds</U>. In order to assist the Company in the refunding of the Prior
  Bonds, the Issuer, concurrently with the execution hereof, will issue, sell
  and deliver the Bonds. The proceeds of the Bonds shall be loaned to the Company
  in accordance with Section 3.1. The Bonds will be issued under and pursuant
  to the Trust Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of February 1, 2003 between
  the Issuer and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and will be
  issued in the aggregate principal amount, will bear interest, will mature and
  will be subject to redemption as set forth therein. The Company hereby approves
  the Indenture and the Bonds and the terms and conditions under which the Bonds
  have been issued, sold and delivered. Each capitalized term not otherwise defined
  herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the Indenture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proceeds from the sale of the Bonds shall be loaned to
  the Company to assist the Company in refunding the Prior Bonds. Those proceeds
  shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held, together with any interest
  earnings thereon, in trust, as provided in the Escrow Agreement for the purpose
  of paying, together with moneys provided by the Company, all of the remaining
  principal, redemption premium and interest due on the Prior Bonds to their redemption
  date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Investment
  of Fund Moneys</U>. Any moneys held as part of the Bond Fund or the Rebate
  Fund shall be invested or reinvested by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture.
  The Issuer (to the extent it retained or retains direction or control) and the
  Company each hereby represent that the investment and reinvestment and the use
  of the proceeds of the Prior Bonds were restricted in such manner and to such

  bonds under Section 148 of the Code and each hereby covenants that it will restrict

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company shall provide the Issuer with, and the Issuer may
  base its certificate and statement on, a certificate of an appropriate officer,
  employee or agent of or consultant to the Company for inclusion in the transcript
  of proceedings for the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the
  Company on the date of delivery of and payment for the Bonds regarding the amount
  and use of the proceeds of the Bonds and the facts, estimates and circumstances
  on which those expectations are based.</P>
<p align="justify"><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loan
  and Repayment</b></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Amount
  and Source of Loan</U>. Concurrently with the delivery of the Bonds, the
  Issuer will, upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, lend the proceeds
  of the Bonds to the Company, by deposit thereof in accordance with the provisions
  of the Indenture. The Bonds may be sold by the Issuer at a discount from their
  principal amount, and in such event, the amount of such discount shall be deemed
  to have been loaned to the Company. To the extent that accrued interest on the
  Bonds is received by the Issuer upon the sale of the Bonds and is deposited
  into the Bond Fund under the Indenture, such accrued interest shall be applied
  to the first interest payment due on the Bonds with a corresponding credit on
  the amounts otherwise due under the Note (as hereinafter defined).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Repayment
  of Loan</U>. The Company agrees to repay the loan made by the Issuer under
  Section 3.1 in installments which, as to amount, shall correspond to the payments
  of principal on the Bonds and, if applicable, any redemption price and shall
  bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per annum, such principal, redemption price
  and interest to be payable when such principal, redemption price, if applicable,
  or interest is due in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that
  such amount shall be reduced to the extent that other moneys on deposit with
  the Trustee are available for such purpose, and a credit in respect thereof
  has been granted pursuant to the Indenture. All such repayments made by the
  Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in funds that will be available
  to the Trustee no later than (a) the corresponding principal or interest payment
  date on the Bonds or (b) if a Bond Insurance Policy is in effect and Section
  6.05 of the Indenture requires the Trustee to notify the Bond Insurer of deficiencies
  prior to payment dates, one Business Day prior to the date the Trustee is required
  to make such payments. To evidence its obligation to pay such amounts, the Company
  will deliver the Note, as described under Section 3.3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The
  Note</U>. Concurrently with the issuance by the Issuer of the Bonds, the
  Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee a debt instrument of the Company,
  which debt instrument shall be in the form of a non-negotiable promissory note
  substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Note"). The Note
  shall</P>


    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;be payable to the Trustee;</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;be in a principal amount equal to the aggregate
  principal amount of the Bonds; </P>

  of principal corresponding to the redemption provisions of the Bonds; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;require all payments on the Note to be made
  on or prior to the due date for the corresponding payment to be made on the
  Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To secure its obligations under the Note at the request of
  and for the benefit of the Bond Insurer (as defined in the Indenture), concurrently
  with the issuance by the Issuer of the Bonds, the Company will execute and deliver
  to the Trustee the Company's Senior Secured Bonds, 3.125% Pollution Control
  Series due 2008 , which will contain principal, interest and redemption provisions
  corresponding to the principal, interest and redemption provisions of the Bonds
  (the &quot;Senior Secured Bonds&quot;). The Senior Secured Bonds will be issued
  pursuant to Supplemental Indenture No. 2 dated as of February 1, 2003 which
  supplements the Company's Indenture dated as of August 1, 2001, as supplemented
  (as so supplemented, the &quot;Company Indenture&quot;) to JPMorgan Chase Bank,
  as trustee (the &quot;Company Indenture Trustee&quot;). Anything herein to the
  contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to make any payment
  of the principal of, or interest on, the Senior Secured Bonds shall be deemed
  to be satisfied and discharged to the extent of the corresponding payment (i)
  made by the Company to the Trustee pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.2 of this Agreement
  and/or on the Note and/or (ii) made with moneys on deposit in any fund or account
  maintained under the Indenture for the payment of the principal or redemption
  price of, or interest on, the Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time any Bonds cease to be Outstanding (other than in
  connection with the cancellation thereof following an exchange or transfer or
  the authentication of other Bonds in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 2.09 of
  the Indenture), the Issuer shall cause the Trustee to surrender to the Company
  Indenture Trustee a corresponding principal amount of Senior Secured Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Issuer shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer the
  Senior Secured Bonds, except to the extent provided in Section&nbsp;12.16 of
  the Indenture. In view of the assignment referred to in Section 3.7 hereof,
  the Issuer agrees that (i) the Senior Secured Bonds shall be issued and delivered
  to, registered in the name of and owned and held by the Trustee for the benefit
  of the holders from time to time of the Bonds; (ii) the Indenture shall provide
  that the Trustee shall not sell, assign or transfer the Senior Secured Bonds
  except (A) to a successor trustee under the Indenture or (B) as permitted by
  Section 12.16 of the Indenture, and shall surrender Senior Secured Bonds to
  the Company Indenture Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Section
  3.3, Section&nbsp;3.4 and Section&nbsp;15.06(b) of the Indenture; and (iii)
  the Company may take such actions as it shall deem to be desirable to effect
  compliance with such restrictions on transfer, including the placing of any
  appropriate legend on each Senior Secured Bond and the issuance of stop-transfer
  instructions to the Company Indenture Trustee or any other transfer agent under
  the Company Indenture. Any action taken by the Trustee in accordance with the
  provisions of Section&nbsp;12.16 of the Indenture shall be binding upon the
  Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Surrender
  of Senior Secured Bonds by the Trustee</U>. Notwithstanding anything herein
  or in the Indenture to the contrary, upon the written request of the Company
  signed by an Authorized Representative thereof, and with the written consent
  of the Bond Insurer (subject to Section 6.09 of the Indenture), if the Bond
  Insurance Policy is then in effect, the Issuer shall cause the Trustee to surrender
  to the Company Indenture Trustee upon the order of the Company signed by an
  Authorized Representative thereof all or any portion of the Senior Secured Bonds,
  as specified by such request of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Acceleration
  of Payment to Redeem Bonds</U>. The Issuer will redeem any of the Bonds
  or portions thereof upon the occurrence of an event which gives rise to any
  special mandatory redemption specified in the Indenture and in accordance with
  the provisions thereof. Upon any such special mandatory redemption, the Company
  shall prepay the Note in full (or in part, if in the opinion of Bond Counsel
  such partial redemption will preserve the exclusion from gross income for federal
  income tax purposes of interest on the Bonds remaining outstanding after such
  redemption). Whenever the Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption,
  the Issuer will, but only upon request of the Company, redeem the same in accordance
  with such request and the Indenture. In either event, the Company will pay an
  amount equal to the applicable redemption price as a prepayment of the Note,
  together with interest accrued to the date of redemption, as provided in the
  Note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event that the Company receives notice from the Trustee
  pursuant to the Indenture that a proceeding has been instituted against a Bondholder
  which could lead to a final determination that interest on the Bonds is taxable,
  the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Issuer whether or not
  it intends to contest such proceeding. In the event that the Company chooses
  to so contest, it will use its best efforts to obtain a prompt final determination
  or decision in such proceeding or litigation and will keep the Trustee and the
  Issuer informed of the progress of any such proceeding or litigation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No
  Defense or Set-Off</U>. The obligations of the Company to make payments
  on the Note shall be absolute and unconditional without defense or setoff by
  reason of any default by the Issuer under this Agreement or under any other
  agreement between the Company and the Issuer or for any other reason, including
  without limitation, loss or impairment of investments in the Bond Fund, any
  acts or circumstances that may constitute failure of consideration, destruction
  of or damage to the Project Facilities, commercial frustration of purpose, or
  failure of the Issuer to perform and observe any agreement, whether express
  or implied, or any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or connected
  with this Agreement, it being the intention of the parties that the payments
  required hereunder will be paid in full when due without any delay or diminution
  whatsoever.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment
  of Issuer's Rights</U>. As the source of payment for the Bonds, the Issuer
  will assign to the Trustee all the Issuer's rights under this Agreement with
  respect to the Bonds (except rights to receive payments under Sections 4.3 and
  4.4) including all of its right, title and interest in the Note and Senior Secured
  Bonds and the moneys payable thereunder. The Company consents to such assignment
  and agrees to make payments on the Note and interest thereon directly to the
  Trustee without defense or setoff by reason of any dispute between the Company
  and the Issuer or the Trustee.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case any action or proceeding is brought against the Issuer
  or the Trustee, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, the party
  seeking indemnity shall promptly give notice of that action or proceeding to
  the Company, and the Company upon receipt of that notice shall have the obligation
  and the right to assume the defense of the action or proceeding. At its own
  expense, an indemnified party may employ separate counsel and participate in
  the defense; provided however, where it is ethically inappropriate for one firm
  to represent the interests of the Issuer and any other indemnified party or
  parties, the Company shall pay the Issuer's or the Trustee's legal expenses,
  respectively, in connection with the Issuer's or the Trustee's retention of

  and neither the members, officers, agents or employees, past, present or future,
  of the Issuer nor any official executing the Bonds shall be liable personally
  on the Bonds or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason
  of the issuance thereof or by reason of the covenants, stipulations, obligations
  or agreements of the Issuer contained in this Agreement or in the Indenture.
  Furthermore, no obligation of the Issuer hereunder or under the Bonds shall
  be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the Issuer, or the
  faith and credit or taxing power of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the County
  of Lehigh, or of any other political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable
  solely out of revenues pledged therefor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Nondiscrimination/Sexual

  or in any payment under this Agreement or the Note, and the Issuer shall employ
  attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of payments due or for
  the enforcement of the performance or observation of any obligation or agreement
  on the part of the Company contained herein or therein, the Company will on
  demand therefor reimburse the reasonable fees of such attorneys and such reasonable

  to withhold or pay any tax imposed by reason of its obligations evidenced by
  the Note or the Senior Secured Bonds, amounts paid to the Trustee on the Note
  or the Senior Secured Bonds, together with other moneys held by the Trustee
  then available, would not be sufficient to make the corresponding payments of
  the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Bonds when such payments
  become due, the Company will pay or cause to be paid the amounts required from
  time to time, when due, to make up any such deficiency.</P>

  in effect and be binding upon the Company notwithstanding the release and discharge
  of the Indenture or the repayment of the loan as contemplated by Section 3.2.

  (LEHIGH COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY)<BR>
  SERIES 2003</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES CORPORATION (the "Company"), a Pennsylvania
  corporation, for value received, promises to pay to JPMorgan Chase Bank (the
  "Trustee"), as Trustee under the Trust Indenture dated as of February 1, 2003
  (the "Indenture") of the Lehigh County Industrial Development Authority (the
  "Issuer"), the principal sum of $90,000,000 on November 1, 2008 and to pay (i)
  interest thereon from the date hereof until the payment of said principal sum
  has been made or provided for at the rate equal to the interest rate borne by
  the Issuer's Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2003 (PPL Electric
  Utilities Corporation Project) (the "Bonds") and payable on each date that interest
  is payable on the Bonds, and (ii) interest on overdue principal, and to the
  extent permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rate borne by the Bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note is issued pursuant to a certain Pollution Control
  Facilities Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of February 1, 2003 between
  the Issuer and the Company relating to the refunding of certain obligations
  of the Issuer previously issued to provide funds for the refunding of bonds
  issued to assist the Company (formerly known as Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light
  Company) in the financing of a portion of the cost of acquiring, constructing
  and installing certain pollution control facilities and sewage or solid waste
  disposal facilities described in Exhibit A to the Agreement (the "Project Facilities").
  The obligation of the Company to make the payments required hereunder shall
  be absolute and unconditional without defense or set-off by reason of any default
  by the Issuer under the Agreement or under any other agreement between the Company
  and the Issuer or for any other reason, including without limitation, loss or
  impairment of investments in the Bond Fund, any acts or circumstances that may
  constitute failure of consideration, destruction of or damage to the Project
  Facilities, commercial frustration of purpose, or failure of the Issuer to perform
  and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty, liability
  or obligation arising out of or connected with the Agreement, it being the intention
  of the Company and the Issuer that the payments hereunder will be paid in full
  when due without any delay or diminution whatsoever.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the request of and for the benefit of the Bond Insurer (as
  such term is defined in the Indenture), and in order to secure its obligations
  with respect to the payment of principal of and interest on this Note, the Company
  has delivered to the Trustee its Senior Secured Bonds, 3.125% Pollution Control
  Series due 2008 (the &quot;Senior Secured Bonds&quot;). The Senior Secured Bonds
  are issued pursuant to Supplemental Indenture No. 2 of the Company dated as
  of February 1, 2003, which supplements the Indenture dated as of August 1, 2001
  of the Company to JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the &quot;Company Indenture
  Trustee&quot;), as supplemented (the &quot;Company Indenture&quot;). As provided
  in the Company Indenture, under certain circumstances, the lien of the Company
  Indenture may be released. As provided in the Agreement, upon the written request
  of the Company, with the written consent of the Bond Insurer (as long as the
  Bond Insurer is not in default of its payment obligations under the Bond Insurance
  Policy), if the Bond Insurance Policy is then in effect, the Senior Secured
  Bonds are to be surrendered to the Company Indenture Trustee upon the order
  of the Company, and the holder hereof, by its acceptance of this Note, consents
  to such surrender.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note is subject to prepayment, at the option of the Company,
  upon written notice to the Trustee given not less than 15 days prior to the
  day on which the Bond Registrar is required to give notice of extraordinary
  optional redemption to the Bondholders pursuant to Section 9.04 of Indenture,
  to the extent that the Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption
  pursuant to Section 9.01(a) of the Indenture at a prepayment price equal to
  the corresponding redemption price of the Bonds. Notice of any extraordinary
  optional prepayment of this Note shall be conditional if the corresponding notice
  of extraordinary optional redemption of the Bonds under Section 9.04 of the
  Indenture is conditional and if the extraordinary optional redemption of the
  Bonds does not occur as a result of a failure of such condition, the notice
  of extraordinary optional prepayment of this Note shall be of no effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Bonds are being called for special mandatory redemption
  as provided in Section 9.01(b) of the Indenture, the Company shall, on or before
  the proposed redemption date for the Bonds, pay to the Trustee the whole or
  portion of the unpaid principal amount of this Note equal to the principal amount
  of the Bonds being called for special mandatory redemption.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event that the Company receives notice from the Trustee
  pursuant to Section 9.01(b) of the Indenture that a proceeding has been instituted
  as described therein which could lead to a final determination that interest
  on the Bonds is taxable, the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the
  Issuer whether or not it intends to contest such proceeding. In the event that
  the Company chooses to so contest, it will use its best efforts to obtain a
  prompt final determination or decision in such proceeding or litigation and
  will keep the Trustee and the Issuer informed of the progress of any such proceeding
  or litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon receipt by the Trustee of notice of extraordinary optional
  prepayment hereof, the Trustee shall take all action necessary under and in
  accordance with the Indenture to redeem Bonds in an amount corresponding to
  that specified in the particular notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is entitled to a credit against its obligations
  under this Note and this Note shall not be subject to required payment or prepayment
  to the extent that amounts which would otherwise be payable by the Company hereunder
  are paid from funds held by the Trustee under the Indenture and available for
  such payment (including from payments by the Company on the Senior Secured Bonds).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever payment or provision therefor has been made in respect
  of the principal or redemption price of all or any portion of the Bonds and
  interest on all or any portion of the Bonds, together with all other sums payable
  by the Issuer under the Indenture, in accordance with Article XVI of the Indenture,
  this Note shall be deemed paid to the extent such payment or provision therefor
  has been made, and if thereby deemed paid in full, this Note shall be canceled
  and returned to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, for any reason,
  the amounts specified above are not sufficient to make corresponding payments
  of principal or redemption price of the Bonds and interest on the Bonds, when
  such payments are due, the Company shall pay as additional amounts due hereunder,
  the amounts required from time to time to make up any such deficiency.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All payments of principal and interest shall be made to the
  Trustee at its corporate trust office in New York, New York or as otherwise
  directed by the Trustee in such coin or currency of the United States of America
  as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and
  private debts. All payments shall be in the full amount required hereunder unless
  the Trustee notifies the Company that it is entitled to a credit under the Agreement,
  this Note or the Indenture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The occurrence and continuance of each of the following events
  is hereby defined as and shall constitute an "Event of Default":</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the Company to pay the principal
  or prepayment price of this Note at maturity or upon unconditional proceedings
  for prepayment within one Business Day of when such principal or prepayment
  price becomes due and payable; or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the Company to pay interest on this
  Note in amounts and at the times necessary to enable the Trustee to pay interest
  on the Bonds within ten Business Days of when such interest becomes due and
  payable; or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If (i) the Company shall (A) apply for or consent
  to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or custodian or the like
  of itself or of its property, (B) admit in writing its inability to pay its
  debts generally as they become due, (C) make a general assignment for the benefit
  of creditors, (D) be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, (E) commence a voluntary
  case under Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") or file
  a voluntary petition or answer seeking reorganization, an arrangement with creditors
  or an order for relief or seeking to take advantage of any insolvency law or
  file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against
  it in any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding; or action shall
  be taken by it for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing, or (ii) if
  without the application, approval or consent of the Company, a proceeding shall
  be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction, under any law relating
  to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of debtors, seeking in respect
  of the Company an order for relief or an adjudication in bankruptcy, reorganization,
  dissolution, winding up, liquidation, a composition or arrangement with creditors,
  a readjustment of debts, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator
  or custodian or the like of the Company or of all or any substantial part of
  its assets, or other like relief in respect thereof under any bankruptcy or
  insolvency law, and, if such proceeding is being contested by the Company in
  good faith, the same shall (A) result in the entry of an order for relief or
  any such adjudication or appointment or (B) continue undismissed, or pending
  and unstayed, for any period of sixty (60) consecutive days.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceleration of the maturity of the Senior
  Secured Bonds upon an occurrence of an &quot;Event of Default&quot; (as defined
  under the Company Indenture).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In each and every such case and during the continuance thereof,
  the Trustee, by notice in writing to the Company may declare the unpaid balance
  of this Note to be due and payable immediately if, concurrently with or prior
  to such notice, the unpaid principal amount of the Bonds has been declared due
  and payable, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be
  immediately due and payable, anything in this Note to the contrary notwithstanding.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after any declaration of acceleration hereunder
  there is an annulment of any declaration of acceleration with respect to the
  Bonds, such annulment shall also automatically constitute an annulment of any
  corresponding declaration under this Note and a waiver and rescission of the
  consequences of such declaration.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a waiver of any event of default under the Senior Secured
  Bonds or any annulment or recission of any acceleration of Senior Secured Bonds
  occurs in accordance with the provisions of the Company Indenture, such waiver,
  annulment or recission shall constitute an automatic waiver, annulment or recission
  of the Event of Default described in clause (d) above and an automatic annulment
  and recission of any resulting acceleration of this Note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right
  under this Note and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned
  for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then
  and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored to their
  respective positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers
  of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had
  been taken, but subject to the limitations of any such adverse determination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company covenants that, in case default shall be made in
  the payment of any installment of principal, prepayment price or interest in
  respect of this Note, whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise, then,
  upon demand of the Issuer or the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee
  the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on this Note for
  principal, prepayment price and interest with interest on the overdue principal
  and prepayment price and (to the extent enforceable under applicable law) on
  the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by this Note; and, in
  addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable
  costs and expenses of collection, including a reasonable compensation to the
  Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities
  incurred by the Trustee other than through its negligence or bad faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts
  upon such demand, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered to take any actions
  permitted under applicable law and to institute any actions or proceedings at
  law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute
  any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce
  any such judgment or final decree against the Company and collect in the manner
  provided by law out of the property of the Company any moneys adjudged or decreed
  to be payable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy
  or for the reorganization of the Company under the Bankruptcy Code or any other
  applicable law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have been appointed for
  the property of the Company or in the case of any other similar judicial proceeding
  relative to the Company, or to the creditors or property of the Company, the
  Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings
  or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of this
  Note and interest owing and unpaid in respect thereof and, in case of any judicial
  proceedings, to file such proofs of claims and other papers or documents as
  may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee allowed
  in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors, or its
  property, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
  deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction
  of its fees, charges and expenses; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in
  bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized to make such payments to the
  Trustee, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for compensation and expenses,
  including reasonable counsel fees incurred by it up to the date of such distribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No provision of this Note or of the Agreement or the Indenture
  shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept
  or adopt on behalf of any Bondholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
  adjustment or composition affecting this Note or the rights of any Bondholder
  in respect thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim
  of any Bondholder in any such proceeding; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
  the Trustee may, on behalf of the Bondholders, vote for the election of a trustee
  in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar
  committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any
  other remedy or remedies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal or
  prepayment price of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon
  or on the Agreement, against any officer, director or stockholder, past, present
  or future, of the Company as such, either directly or through the Company, under
  any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement
  of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note shall at all times be and remain part of the trust
  estate under the Indenture, and no assignment or transfer by the Trustee of
  its rights hereunder shall be effective, other than (i) a transfer made after
  an Event of Default under the Indenture in the course of the Trustee's exercise
  of its rights and remedies consequent upon such Event of Default, (ii) a transfer
  required in the performance of the Trustee's duties under the Indenture, or
  (iii) a transfer to a successor trustee under the Indenture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note has been delivered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
  and shall be deemed to be governed by, and interpreted under, the laws of that
  Commonwealth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Capitalized terms used in this Note not defined herein shall

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the term of this contract, the Company agrees as to
  itself and each tenant of the Project controlling, controlled by or under common
  control with the Company (each of the Company and each such tenant, a "Contractor")
  as follows:</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hiring of any employee(s) for the manufacture
    of supplies, performance of work, or any other activity required under the
    contract or any subcontract, the Contractor, subcontractor, or any person
    acting on behalf of the Contractor or subcontractor shall not, by reason of
    gender, race, creed, or color, discriminate against any citizen of this Commonwealth

    of the policy. The policy must contain a notice that sexual harassment will
    not be tolerated and employees who practice it will be disciplined.</P>
