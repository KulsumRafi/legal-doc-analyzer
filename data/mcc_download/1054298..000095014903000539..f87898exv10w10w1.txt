MARKETING/PUBLICITY

Subject to approval from both Your and DoubleClick's marketing departments,

<PAGE>

Upon the execution of this Agreement, both parties agree to work together to
develop a press release meant to inform the public of the parties' agreement set
forth herein. Upon Your prior approval, DoubleClick shall have the right to use
Your name in DoubleClick's marketing materials promoting the Service.

MOST FAVORED NATION PRICING

In the event that the number of paid banner ad impressions served by DoubleClick
and paid for by You exceeds 1 billion in any calendar month, DoubleClick agrees
that for each moth thereafter that You generate more than one billion paid
impressions, the Monthly Service Fee per thousand page views shall be equal to
or lower than the fee provided to any other DoubleClick customer.

SERVICE LEVELS

DoubleClick shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the DART
Service delivers Ads at least ninety-nine and three/tenths percent (99.3%) of
the time, calculated on a calendar monthly basis; it being understood that DART
Service Ad delivery "down" time (calculated as the difference between 100% and
the actual percentage delivery of ads) shall exclude time (i) required for
routine system maintenance not to exceed thirty (30) minutes in any calendar
month that is performed by DoubleClick so long as such maintenance is performed
during low volume time periods, and (ii) resulting from technical malfunctions
in the Web Sites' systems, or any other circumstances beyond DoubleClick's
reasonable control (including, without limitation, Internet delays, network
congestion and ISP malfunctions). In the event that unscheduled down time
exceeds five (5) hours in any month, then You will receive a reduction in fees,
credited to the next month's invoice, calculated by multiplying (i) the Average
Impressions Per Hour, by (ii) the down time (rounded to the nearest hour), by
(iii) the CPM rate applicable at the time of the outage. The Average Impressions
shall be determined by dividing the total ads served in the previous month by
the total number of hours in that month.

SERVICE RESPONSE TIMES

For material functions of the Service that are or have become substantially
inoperable, DoubleClick will commence a bug fix or work around within one (1)
hour after the first report of such error from You. For other functions of the
Service that are impaired or otherwise fail to operate, DoubleClick will
commence a bug fix or workaround within twenty-four (24) hours after the report
of such error from You.

ADDITIONAL TERMINATION RIGHT

In addition to the termination rights set forth in Section 10 below, You shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement without cause upon sixty (60) days
prior written notice to DoubleClick. In the event of such termination, You will
not be liable for any fees to DoubleClick other than fees incurred before the
date of termination.

1. AGREEMENT. DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick') and You hereby enter into the

(collectively, this "DART Service Agreement" or "Agreement"), as of the
Effective Date set forth on the Cover Page. All capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in these Terms and Conditions shall have the meanings as defined on the
Cover Page. "Advertiser" shall mean any entity or person that desires to
advertise their own products or services. "Publisher" shall mean any entity or
person that desires to use the DART Service to target and measure advertisements
for Advertisers on their own Web site.

2. DART SERVICE. The DART Service (the "Service") is a service provided by

DoubleClick's servers to the Web Sites set forth on the cover page of this
Agreement ("Target Sites"). The ad banners are displayed to visitors
("Visitors") to the Target Sites based on criteria selected by You and Your
Advertisers.

3. AD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. You and DoubleClick understand that You are required to
use DoubleClick's proprietary Ad Management System software technology (the
"System") in order to receive the Service. Accordingly, DoubleClick grants to
You the non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and use the System,
which You can access and use only on DoubleClick's Web servers by means of a
unique password issued by DoubleClick, and only for the purposes of (i)
performing projections of ad banner impression inventories that might be
available through the Service, (ii) uploading and storing ad banners for
delivery by the Service, (iii) selecting trafficking criteria for the delivery
of ad banners to Target Sites and Visitors, and (iv) receiving reports of ad
banner impressions and other data related to the delivery of ad banners by the
Service.

4. YOUR OBLIGATIONS. You shall be solely responsible for soliciting all
Advertisers, trafficking of ad banners (which shall include the input of ad
banners into the System) and handling all inquiries of any type or nature. You
shall obtain all necessary rights, licenses, consents, waivers and permissions
from Advertisers, Visitors and others, to allow DoubleClick to store and deliver
ad banners and otherwise operate the Service on Your behalf and on behalf of
Your Advertisers, and to use any data provided to or collected by the System.
You further represent that You have read, and will conform to, DoubleClick's
statement on privacy that can be found on the DoubleClick Web site. You further
agree that advertisements provided to DoubleClick and/or delivered on behalf of
You, and Your other promotional and marketing activities in connection with the

proper use of the Service and the System. A "training day" is defined as a full
day training session for one of Your employees. You can divide the training days
in any manner You deem appropriate, such as having three employees attend two
sessions each, six employees attend one session each, or one employee attend all
six sessions. The cost for such training sessions is included in the Upfront
Fee. If You require additional training or training on Your site, DoubleClick
shall provide such training to You at DoubleClick's standard published rates for
such training. For training on Your Site, You agree to reimburse DoubleClick for
its actual travel and lodging expenses. You shall not permit any of Your
employees to access and use the Service or the System unless any such employee
has successfully completed the training session and has been so certified by
DoubleClick.

6. FEES. You shall pay DoubleClick the fees set forth on the Cover Page to this
Agreement. The fees may include an Upfront Fee and Monthly Service Fees. The
Upfront Fee is a one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable fee for Your use of
the Service and the System, payable upon execution of this Agreement. The
Monthly Service Fees are recurring, non-refundable, non-creditable fees, payable
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from DoubleClick for such
fees. The Monthly Service Fee shall be based on the number of ad banner
impressions delivered through the Service on behalf of You each month, divided
by one thousand (1,000) and multiplied by the Monthly Service Fee CPM rate set
forth on the Cover Page to this Agreement. If Your Monthly Service Fee is less
than the Minimum Monthly Service Fee in any given month, You shall owe
DoubleClick the Minimum Monthly Service Fee for that month. To the extent that
the average file size of all ad banners delivered via the Service in a given
month ("Average Ad Size") exceeds the Ad Size Limit set forth on the Cover Page,
the Monthly Service Fee payable for that month shall be increased by an amount
that shall be calculated by subtracting the Ad Size Limit from the Average Ad
Size, dividing that difference by the Ad Size Limit, and multiplying the
quotient by the Monthly Service Fee CPM rate set forth on the Cover Page of this
Agreement. All fees hereunder shall be denominated in U.S. dollars. You shall
also be responsible for and shall pay any applicable sales, use or other taxes
or duties, tariffs or the like applicable to provision of the Service (except
for taxes on DoubleClick's income). Late payments will be subject to late fees
at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if lower, the
maximum rate allowed by law. If You fail to pay fees invoiced by DoubleClick
within sixty (60) days following the payment due date, DoubleClick shall have
the right to suspend performance of the Services, provided that Notice of such
suspension is provided to You, and receipt of such suspension notice is
confirmed by You, no less than 14 days before the Suspension of service; such
Service not to be reinstated until You pay all such overdue amounts and an
additional reinstatement fee of $|*|. Upon payment of such reinstatement fee,
Doubleclick agrees to reinstate service in a commercially reasonable timeframe,
not to exceed 24 hours. In addition, You also agree to pay any reasonable
attorneys' fees and/or collection costs incurred by DoubleClick in collecting
any past due amounts from You.
