CONSENT</FONT></B>

<FONT size="2">The consolidated financial statements of SAP
Aktiengesellschaft Systeme, Anwendungen, Produkte in der
Datenverarbeitung (the &#147;Company&#148;) for each of the
years ended 2001 and 2000, included in the Company&#146;s Annual
Report on Form 20-F, have been audited by Arthur Andersen
Wirschaftspr&#252;fungsgesellschaft Steuerberatungsgesellschaft
mbH (&#147;Arthur Andersen&#148;). On May&nbsp;3, 2002, the
Company dismissed Arthur Andersen as its independent public
accountants and engaged KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft
Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftspr&#252;fungsgesellschaft to serve
as the Company&#146;s independent public accountants for the
fiscal year 2002. After reasonable efforts, the Company has been
unable to obtain Arthur Andersen&#146;s consent to the
incorporation by reference into this registration statement on
Form&nbsp;20-F of its audit report with respect to the
Company&#146;s financial statements referenced above.

<FONT size="2">Under these circumstances, Rule&nbsp;437a under
the Securities Act permits the Company to file the Annual
Report, which is incorporated by reference into the
Company&#146;s previously filed registration statements on
Form&nbsp;S-8 (Nos. 333-60399, 333-65083, 333-30380, 333-41762,
333-63496, 333-63464 and 333-102564) without a written consent
from Arthur Andersen. However, because Arthur Andersen has not
consented to the inclusion of its report in this annual report
on Form&nbsp;20-F, as incorporated by reference into the above
referenced registration statements, recovery by investors
relying on any such registration statement that incorporates
this annual report on Form&nbsp;20-F by reference may be limited
on certain claims. In particular, and without limitation,
purchasers of securities under each such registration statement
may not be able to assert claims against Arthur Andersen under
Section&nbsp;11(a) of the Securities Act for any untrue
statements of a material fact contained in the financial
statements referenced above and incorporated therein or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein. In
addition, the ability of Arthur Andersen to satisfy any claims
(including claims arising from Arthur Andersen&#146;s provision
of auditing and other services to the Company) may be limited as
a practical matter due to recent events regarding Arthur
Andersen.
