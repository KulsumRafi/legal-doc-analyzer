                            ARTICLE II. STOCK AWARDS

2.1 Number of Shares. Eligible Participants in the Program will be awarded
shares of OCA Common Stock under the Program (subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.3
and the other terms and conditions of the Program) in an amount determined as
follows, rounded down to the nearest whole number:

       (x)    the amount of the Applicable Participant's Service Fees During the
              12 Months Ended October 31, 2001 (as defined below),

              DIVIDED BY

       (y)    $18.85.

For purposes of the Program:

"Applicable Participant's Service Fees During the 12 Months Ended October 31,
2001" means the amount of Service Fees (as defined below) actually paid by the
applicable Participant and/or the PC that is owned by and employing such
Participant to OrthAlliance or its subsidiary during and with respect to the 12
calendar months ended October 31, 2001 under the applicable Service/Consulting
Agreement.

"Service Fees" means service, management service or consulting fees (excluding
any amounts reimbursed, paid, earned or accrued with respect to center expenses,
operating and non-operating expenses incurred in the operation of the applicable
practice or other expenses) actually paid to OCA, OrthAlliance or their
subsidiaries by the applicable Affiliated Practitioner and/or the PC owned by
and employing such Affiliated Practitioner pursuant to the applicable
Service/Consulting Agreement or Business Services Agreement.

2.2 Timing and Conditions of Grants. Shares of OCA Common Stock awarded under
the Program shall be issuable to Participants in four annual installments
(subject to Section 2.3 and the other terms and conditions of the Program), as
follows:

         (a) For each Participant, 25% of the total number of shares of OCA
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be awarded to such
Participant under the Program will be issued to such Participant following each
of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries (each such anniversary
date, a "Vesting Date") of


                                       3
<PAGE>

the Applicable Date (as defined below) with respect to such Participant, if, and
only if, the amount of Service Fees paid to OCA, OrthAlliance or their
subsidiaries by the Participant and/or the PC owned by and employing such
Participant during and with respect to the 12 calendar months immediately
preceding that particular Vesting Date is at least 90% (the "90% Minimum
Target") of the amount of the Applicable Participant's Service Fees During the
12 Months Ended October 31, 2001.

         For purposes of the Program, "Applicable Date" means: (A) November 9,
2001 (the effective date of the Merger) for each Participant who executes and
delivers to OCA his or her Amendments or Business Services Agreement, a
Participation Agreement and an Investor Suitability Questionnaire as provided in
Sections 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5 hereof by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on
July 15, 2002; and (B) for each of the other Participants, the last day of the
month during which the Participant executes and delivers to OCA his or her
Amendments or Business Services Agreement, a Participation Agreement and an
Investor Suitability Questionnaire as provided in Sections 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5
hereof.

         (b) However, if the 90% Minimum Target is not achieved in the 12
calendar month period immediately preceding the first, second or third such
Vesting Date (each, an "Earlier Period"), but is achieved during the 12 calendar
month period immediately preceding a subsequent Vesting Date (each, a "Later
Period"), then the installment of shares of OCA Common Stock issuable with
respect to such Earlier Period will be issued following such Later Period. By
way of illustration, if such target were not achieved during the periods
preceding the second or third Vesting Dates, but was achieved during the period
preceding the fourth Vesting Date, then the installment of shares for the second
and third vesting periods would be issued after the fourth Vesting Date.

2.3 Participant May Elect to Receive Promissory Note In Lieu of Shares.

         (a) Promissory Note. During the 30 calendar days ending on and
including the first Vesting Date, a Participant may make a one-time, permanent
election (as provided below) as to all shares of OCA Common Stock that the
Participant may be issued under the Program, to receive, in lieu and full
substitution of any and all shares of OCA Common Stock that would otherwise be
issued to such Participant pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Program, a
non-transferable, non-negotiable promissory note from OCA or a subsidiary
thereof selected by OCA substantially in the form and substance of the form of
Promissory Note attached as Exhibit E hereto ("Promissory Note"), in an original
principal amount equal to the product of:

              (x)    the Applicable Stock Price (as defined below),

              TIMES

              (y)    the total, maximum number of shares of OCA Common Stock
                     that would otherwise be issued to such Participant pursuant
                     to Section 2.1 of the Program (notwithstanding the vesting
                     conditions set forth in Section 2.2).

For purposes of the Program:

         o    "Applicable Stock Price" means: (A) the sum of (x) $1.00, plus (y)
              the 10-Day Average Closing Price, for each Participant who
              executes and delivers to OCA his or her Amendments or Business
              Services Agreement, a Participation Agreement and an Investor
              Suitability Questionnaire as provided in Sections 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5
              hereof by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on July 15, 2002,
              and (B) the 10-Day Average Closing Price, for each of the other
              Participants.

         o    "10-Day Average Closing Price" means the average closing price per
              share of OCA Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange
              during the 10 trading day period immediately following the date on
              which the Participant executes and delivers to OCA his or her
              Amendments or Business Services Agreement, and Participation
              Agreement and Investor Suitability Questionnaire as provided in
              Sections 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5 hereof.

                                       4
<PAGE>


         (b) Other Terms of Promissory Note. Principal amounts owing under the
Promissory Note will bear interest from the first Vesting Date (except as
provided in subsection 2.3(d) hereof) at a rate equal to the prime rate on the
first Vesting Date (as reported in the Wall Street Journal or comparable
reporting service selected by OCA) plus 1.5% per annum. OCA may prepay all or
part of the amounts owing under the Promissory Note at any time in its
discretion without penalty. The Promissory Note will be non-transferable and
non-negotiable.

         (c) Election. A Participant may make such election to receive a
Promissory Note in lieu of all shares of OCA Common Stock to be issued to such
Participant under the Program only by giving written notice of such election to
the Chief Executive Officer of OCA during the 30 calendar days ending on and
including the first Vesting Date. Once such an election has been made, it may
not be withdrawn, and such an election may not be made before or following such
30-day period, and may not be made during the 30 days ending on any other
Vesting Date. If such Participant makes such an election, in accordance with
such notice and timing requirements, such Participant will be issued a
Promissory Note in an original principal amount computed as provided above, in
complete substitution and replacement of all shares of OCA Common Stock to be
issued to such Participant pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the Program, and
such shares will not be issued to such Participant.

         (d) Manner of Payment. Principal and accrued interest payable under
such Promissory Note will be payable in up to four installments, as follows:

                  (i) the first installment will consist of principal only (with
         respect to which no interest shall accrue), in an amount equal to 25%
         of the original principal amount of the Promissory Note, and will be
         payable within 15 business days following the first Vesting Date
         (subject to the conditions described in this paragraph below); and

                  (ii) the second, third and fourth installments will each
         consist of principal and accrued interest, in an amount equal to 25% of
         the original principal amount of the Promissory Note and interest
         accrued on that payment of 25% of the original principal amount since
         the first Vesting Date, and will be payable within 15 business days
         following the second, third and fourth Vesting Dates, respectively
         (subject to the conditions described in this paragraph below).
         Each such installment will be payable if, and only if, the amount of
         Service Fees paid to OCA, OrthAlliance or their subsidiaries by the
         Participant and/or the PC owned by and employing such Participant
         during and with respect to the 12 calendar months immediately preceding
         the particular Vesting Date relating to that installment is at least
         equal to the 90% Minimum Target. However, if the 90% Minimum Target is
         not achieved in an Earlier Period (in which case the installment of
         principal and accrued interest relating to that Earlier Period shall
         cease to accrue interest as of the Vesting Date relating to such
         Earlier Period), but is achieved during a Later Period, then the
         installment payable with respect to such Earlier Period will be paid
         following such Later Period in the same amount of principal and accrued
         interest that would have been paid following the Earlier Period (with
         no interest accruing thereon from the Vesting Date relating to such
         Earlier Period).

2.4 Pro Rata Basis for Practices with Multiple Owners. If a Participant's PC is
partially owned by one or more other Affiliated Practitioners, then the number
of shares of OCA Common Stock awarded pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above for
such Participant (and the principal amount of any Promissory Note issued under
Section 2.3 above) shall be calculated by multiplying the number of shares of
OCA Common Stock that would otherwise be granted to such person pursuant to such
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 (and the principal amount of any Promissory Note issued
under Section 2.3 above) by his or her percentage of equity ownership of such
PC.

2.5 Only Whole Shares. Only whole shares of OCA Common Stock will be issued or
awarded under the Program; no fractional shares shall be issued and the
fractional share component of any computation hereunder shall be ignored.


                                       5
<PAGE>

             ARTICLE III. ADJUSTMENT UPON CERTAIN CORPORATE CHANGES

3.1 Adjustments to Shares. The number of shares of OCA Common Stock subject to
an outstanding award of shares of OCA Common Stock granted to a Participant
under and pursuant to the Program shall be adjusted as the Committee (as defined
below) determines (in its sole discretion) to be appropriate, in the event that
(a) OCA effects one or more stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits,
subdivisions, consolidations, recapitalizations or other similar events; (b) OCA
engages in a transaction to which Section 424 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code") applies; or (c) there occurs any other event
which in the judgment of the Committee necessitates such action.

3.2 No Adjustment upon Certain Transactions. The issuance by OCA of shares of
stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class,
for cash or property, or for labor or services rendered, either upon direct sale
or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon
conversion of shares or obligations of OCA convertible into such shares or other
securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made
with respect to, outstanding awards.

                     ARTICLE IV. LEGAL COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS

4.1 General. No OCA Common Stock or Promissory Note shall be issued under the
Program except in compliance with all federal or state laws and regulations
(including, without limitation, withholding tax requirements), federal and state
securities laws and regulations and the rules of all securities exchanges or
self-regulatory organizations on which shares of OCA Common Stock may be listed.
OCA shall have the right to rely on the advice of its counsel as to such
compliance. Any certificate issued to evidence shares of OCA Common Stock and
any Promissory Note granted under the Program may bear such legends and
statements as OCA upon advice of counsel may deem advisable to assure compliance
with federal or state laws and regulations. No OCA Common Stock or Promissory
Note shall be issued and no certificate for shares shall be delivered until OCA
has obtained such consent or approval as OCA may deem advisable from any
regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such matters.

4.2 Representations by Participants. As a condition to the issuance of OCA
Common Stock or a Promissory Note under the Program or any Participation
Agreement, OCA may require a Participant to represent and warrant that the
Participant does not have a present intention to sell or distribute such shares
and is obtaining such shares for investment and not with a view to distribution.
At the option of OCA, a stop transfer order against any shares of stock may be
placed on the official stock books and records of OCA, and a legend indicating
that the stock may not be pledged, sold or otherwise transferred unless an
opinion of counsel was provided (concurred in by counsel for OCA) and stating
that such transfer is not in violation of any applicable law or regulation may
be stamped on the stock certificate in order to assure exemption from
registration. The Committee may also require such other action or agreement by
the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with federal or
state securities laws. This provision shall not obligate OCA or any affiliate
thereof to undertake registration of stock hereunder.

                     ARTICLE V. ADMINISTRATION AND AMENDMENT

5.1 Administrative Committee. The Program shall be administered by a committee
composed of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of OCA
and/or any other officer or officers of OCA appointed to such committee by the
chief executive officer of OCA (the "Committee"). The express grant in the
Program of any specific power to the Committee shall not be construed as
limiting any power or authority of the Committee. Any decision made or action
taken by the Committee to administer the Program shall be final and conclusive.
No member of the Committee shall be liable for any act done in good faith with
respect to the Program or any Participation Agreement. In addition to all other
authority vested with the Committee under the Program, the Committee shall have
complete authority to: (a) interpret all provisions of the Program; (b)
prescribe the form of any Participation Agreement; (c) make amendments to all
Participation Agreements; (d) adopt, amend, and rescind rules for Program
administration; and (e) make all determinations it deems advisable for the
administration of the Program.

5.2 Determination of Financial Performance. The authorities of the Committee
described in Section 5.1 include the full discretionary authority to make all
determinations regarding financial performance and related matters referenced in
the Program. Such matters include, but are not limited to, whether or not
Participants have achieved the criteria and standards of performance required to
participate in the Program and receive awards of OCA Common Stock. The Committee
shall make such determinations by reference to any data and information that it
deems appropriate and, to the extent that such information that is provided by a
Participant is not otherwise subject to disclosure, shall employ reasonable
measures that are designed to keep such information confidential.

5.3 Amendment and Termination of Program. OCA may amend, supplement, cancel
and/or terminate the Program and the Exhibits hereto at any time, with or
without notice to Participants or prospective Participants; provided, however,
an amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights of a
Participant under an outstanding award of shares of OCA Common Stock (or
Promissory Note, as applicable) under the Program is not valid as to that
Participant without the Participant's consent. If the Program is not earlier
terminated as provided herein, no additional Participants may participate in the
Program or be eligible for the Program following December 31, 2002, unless
further extended in a written amendment to the Program by OCA in its discretion;
provided, however, that any awards of shares of OCA Common Stock, or Promissory
Note in lieu of shares of OCA Common Stock, to Participants under the Program
shall continue in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program and
shall continue to be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions. The
terms and conditions of the Program may not be waived, except in writing signed
by an authorized officer of OCA. The waiver of any of the terms and conditions
of the Program shall not be construed as a waiver of any other terms and
conditions hereof.

                         ARTICLE VI. GENERAL PROVISIONS

6.1 Unfunded Program. The Program shall be unfunded, and OCA shall not be
required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by grants
under the Program. Any liability of OCA to any person with respect to any grant
under the Program shall be based solely upon contractual obligations that may be
created hereunder. No such obligation of OCA shall be deemed to be secured by
any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property of OCA.

6.2 Rules of Construction. Headings are given to the articles and sections of
the Program solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. The masculine
gender when used herein refers to both masculine and feminine. The reference to
any statute, regulation or other provision of law shall be construed to refer to
any amendment to or successor of such provision of law.

6.3 Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of Louisiana (without regard
to the choice of law provisions of Louisiana) shall apply to all matters arising
