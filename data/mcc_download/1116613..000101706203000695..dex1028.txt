                                    --------

     WHEREAS, Section 2 of the Agreement provides for a revolving working
capital facility (the "Facility") under which ICN agreed to make Loans to
Ribapharm in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time the
Commitment;

     WHEREAS, ICN made Loans to Ribapharm from time to time under the Facility,
and Ribapharm executed a Revolving Credit Note dated April 17, 2002 in
connection with such Loans;

     WHEREAS, a total of $35,983,967.00 in aggregate principal and interest is
                         --------------
outstanding on such Loans as of the date hereof (the "Current Balance");

     WHEREAS, prior to this Amendment the Agreement provided that ICN agreed to
make Loans only prior to August 31, 2002, and that Ribapharm would repay all
Loans in full no later than December 31, 2003; and

     WHEREAS, Ribapharm desires to repay the Current Balance immediately,
provided ICN will agree to make further Loans to Ribapharm under the Facility if
needed through December 30, 2003 (or through December 29, 2005, if approved by

other limitations set forth below;

                                    AMENDMENT
                                    ---------

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     1.   Ribapharm will repay to ICN on the date hereof the sum of
          $35,983,967.00, representing the aggregate principal and interest
          --------------

     2.   The "Commitment," as defined in the Agreement, is reduced from
          $60,000,000 to $35,000,000 from and after the date hereof.

     3.   Subject to approval by ICN's Board of Directors, "Expiration Date," as

          such approval by ICN's Board of Directors is obtained, "Expiration
          Date" from and after the date hereof means December 30, 2003.

     4.   Subject to approval by ICN's Board of Directors, Section 2.3(a) of the
          Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety: "Ribapharm
          undertakes to repay in full the amount of the Loans outstanding
          hereunder, together with all interest accrued and outstanding thereon,
          no later than the earlier of (a) December 30, 2005 and (b) the next

          outstanding common stock of Ribapharm." Unless and until such approval
          by ICN's Board of Directors is obtained, Section 2.3(a) of the
          Agreement remains unchanged.

     5.   This Amendment is made pursuant to Section 7.6 of the Agreement. In
