                      delivery of (i) an 18-month promissory note made payable
                      (with full recourse) by WTC and New WCG (as co-issuers)
                      and guaranteed by WCL in the original principal amount of
                      $50 million (subject to an adjustment for certain unfunded
                      obligations owed by TWC as set forth in the Building
                      Purchase Agreement), with interest at the rate of 10% per
                      annum and principal to be amortized over the term of the
                      note, (ii) a 7 1/2-year promissory note made payable (with
                      full recourse) by WTC and New WCG (as co-issuers) and
                      guaranteed by WCL in the original principal amount of $100
                      million (subject to reduction upon certain Dispositions as
                      provided and defined in the Building Purchase Agreement),
                      with interest at the rate of 7% per annum and principal to
                      be amortized on the basis of a 30-year schedule, such

                      to all Building Purchase Assets to secure payment of the
                      Building Purchase Notes, all of which shall be in a form
                      to be mutually agreed upon by the Debtors, TWC, the
                      Committee, and Leucadia (the "Building Purchase Collateral
                      Documents"). In connection with the closing of the
                      Building Purchase Agreement, the Lenders shall be granted
                      a fully subordinated, second priority lien on the Building

                      agreed upon by the Debtors, TWC, Leucadia, the Committee
                      and the Administrative Agent (the "Lender Second
                      Mortgage").

         3. The definition of "Building Purchase Agreement" in the Glossary of
Settlement Agreement Defined Terms shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced
with the following:

                      "Building Purchase Agreement" means the agreement dated as
                      of July 26, 2002, a true and correct copy of which is
                      annexed hereto as Exhibit 4, pursuant to which, as a
                      component of the TWC Settlement, WTC shall purchase, the
                      Building Purchase Assets from WHBC, as such agreement is
                      amended from time to time.

         4. All references in the Agreement to "Building Purchase Note" shall be
replaced with the term "Building Purchase Notes", as defined in this Amendment.

         5. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

         6. Except as specifically amended hereby, the Agreement is in all
respects confirmed, ratified and approved.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Amendment on
and as of the date and year first above written.
