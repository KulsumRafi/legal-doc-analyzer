          further  understands  and  acknowledges that any stock options awarded
          hereunder  shall  be subject to a three (3) year vesting schedule. Any
          such  stock  option awards made pursuant to this Section 5(e) shall be
          made  subject  to  any  and  all terms and conditions contained in the
          Company's  2002  Non-Qualified and Incentive Stock Option Plan and the

          such  shares  on  the over-the-counter market on the last business day
          prior  to the date on which the value is to be determined (or the next
          preceding  date on which sales occurred if there were no sales on such
          date).  The  year-end bonus schedule provided in this Section shall be
          in  effect  for  fiscal  year  2003  only.

          (h)  Management Based Objective ("MBO"). Employee shall be eligible to
               ----------------------------------
          receive  a one-time, lump sum bonus up to $20,000.00 at the end of the
          Company's  fiscal  2003  if  the  Company's  total  outstanding vendor
          receivables  are  reduced  from  $2,800,000.00  to  zero by the end of
          fiscal  2003.  The  President of the Company shall retain the sole and
          complete  discretion  to  determine the dollar amount of the bonus, if
          any,  which  shall be paid to Employee under this MBO. For purposes of
          this section, "vendor receivables" shall be defined as all receivables
          related  to  the  following  Company  accounts,  without regard to and
          excluding  any  reserves  established  on the Company's books for such
          accounts:  rebate receivables, receivables related to product returns,
          price  protection  receivables,  NSN  receivables,  deposits,

          thereunder,  marketing  receivables, and other miscellaneous accounts.
          In  no  event  shall  the term "vendor receivables," as defined herein
          above,  include  receivables  related  to the Company's customer trade
          accounts.  This  Management  Based  Objective  bonus,  as provided for
          hereinabove,  shall  be  in  effect  for  fiscal  year  2003  only.

2.     Section  6(f)  of the Agreement shall be amended by replacing any and all
references  therein  to  $300,000.00  to  $500,000.00.  Accordingly, the Company
shall  increase  the term life insurance policy that it maintains on the life of
Employee,  pursuant  to  Section  6(f)  of  the  Agreement,  from $300,000.00 to
$500,000.00.

     Except as modified by this Second Amendment to Employment Agreement, the
parties affirm and ratify the terms and conditions of the Agreement and First
