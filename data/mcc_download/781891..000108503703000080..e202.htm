</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VANCOUVER, BC, November 14, 2002 - LML PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC. (the "Corporation") (Nasdaq: LMLP) reports results for its second quarter and six months ended September 30, 2002. Earnings before income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the second quarter was a loss of approximately ($162,000) or approximately ($0.01) per share, compared to an EBITDA loss of approximately ($1.2 million) or approximately ($0.06) per share for the second quarter ended September 30, 2001, an improvement in EBITDA of approximately $1.0 million or approximately 86.5%.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenues for the second quarter were approximately $2.0 million, compared to approximately $2.3 million for the second quarter ended September 30, 2001, a decrease of approximately 13%. This decrease was a result of a reduction in overall returned check volume processed which was partially attributable to one of our largest customers, moving its primary check collections in-house, which was completed by September 30, 2001, and partially a result of softer consumer spending trends resulting in lower check volumes. </P>
