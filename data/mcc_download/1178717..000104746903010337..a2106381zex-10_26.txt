II.  Miscellaneous Provisions.

          1.   In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Amendment, each
Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and warrants that:

          (a)  no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Seventh Amendment

     representation or warranty made as of a specific date shall be true and
     correct in all material respects as of such specific date).

          2.   This Amendment is limited as specified and shall not constitute a
modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document.

          3.   This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which

shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with Holdings and the Administrative Agent.

          4.   THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE
