     This Agreement (Agreement) is made as of January 6, 2003 (the Effective
Date) by and among (i) ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICN) and Ribapharm Inc.
(Ribapharm), each a Delaware corporation, and (ii) Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a New
Jersey corporation, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, a Swiss corporation
(individually and together, Roche).

                                    Recitals

     A. Ribapharm is the owner of patents in various countries which contain
claims relating to certain pharmaceutical uses of ribavirin, an oral antiviral
product.

     B. Roche has developed an antiviral product containing ribavirin.

     C. Ribapharm, ICN or both have filed suit and/or counterclaims against
Roche in Europe and the United States contending that Roche's intended
commercialization of its ribavirin product would infringe Ribapharm's patents
relating to ribavirin.

     D. Roche has filed suit, opposition proceedings and/or counterclaims
against Ribapharm, ICN or both contending that Ribapharm's ribavirin patents are
neither valid nor infringed by Roche's intended commercialization of ribavirin.

     E. The Parties wish to obviate the need for such contested proceedings in
favor of Ribapharm granting a non-exclusive license to Roche under Ribapharm's
ribavirin patents.

                                   Agreement

     For consideration, the value, sufficiency, and receipt of which are hereby

Affiliates for the sale of Products among Roche and its Affiliates for resale
will not be included in the computation of Net Sales. If the Product is sold as
a Combined Product, Net Sales for the Combined Product will be calculated by
multiplying actual Net Sales of such Combined Product by the fraction

regulatory authorities for such product. Examples of such minor changes in
manufacturing are (i) adjustment of excipients, pH, electrolytes, or
preservatives, or use of new raw materials such that the raw materials do not
lead or result in chemical changes to or chemical modifications of the PEG,
linker or interferon alpha portion of the active ingredient, (ii) starting
materials or intermediates that do not chemically change the PEG, linker or
interferon alpha portion of the active ingredient, (iii) other manufacturing
variations that result from the need to accommodate new sources of raw materials
or manufacturing methods, or (iv) changes in the average number of PEG units
and/or their location of attachment on the interferon alpha portion based on
batch to batch variations or manufacturing site to manufacturing site variations
and such that the manufacturing modifications are not chemical changes to or
chemical modifications of the PEG, linker or interferon alpha portion of the
active ingredient. Examples of changes that are not minor manufacturing
modifications are any chemical changes to or chemical modifications of the PEG,
linker or interferon alpha portion of the active ingredient.

     Product means any pharmaceutical product consisting of or containing the
Licensed Compound which is promoted and sold for use in combination with
PEG-IFN-alpha, including without limitation a Combined Product.

     2.1 License

     Ribapharm grants to Roche and its Affiliates, and Roche accepts on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, a non-exclusive, non-transferable and
non-sublicensable right and license under the Licensed Patents within the Field
throughout the Territory to make, have made, use, sell and distribute Products.

     2.2 Limit of Grant

     Roche has no right or license with respect to the Licensed Patents except
as expressly granted in this Agreement.

     2.3 Schering Consent

     Ribapharm represents and warrants to Roche that ICN has previously
exclusively licensed the Licensed Patents for use within the Field throughout
the Territory to Schering Plough Ltd. pursuant to the Schering License and that
the rights and obligations of ICN under the


                                       6

<PAGE>

Schering License have been assigned to and assumed by Ribapharm with the consent
of Schering-Plough Ltd. pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 8, 2002
between ICN, Schering-Plough Ltd. and Ribapharm. Roche represents and warrants
to Ribapharm and ICN that by a Settlement and License Agreement dated August 10,
2001 by and between Roche and Schering Corporation, an affiliate of Schering
Plough Ltd., Schering Corporation agreed to waive so much of its exclusivity
under the Licensed Patents as to allow ICN and Roche to enter into a license to
commercialize Roche's PEG-IFN-alpha product in combination therapy with the
Licensed Compound, and further agreed that upon written notice to Schering
Corporation, Schering Corporation would consent to and modify Schering-Plough
Ltd.'s exclusive rights under the Schering License to allow for the grant of
such a license to Roche without requiring consideration from ICN to Schering
Plough Ltd. (the Schering Consent). To the best of each Party's information and
belief, the Schering Consent is the only consent that may be required from
Schering Plough Ltd. to enable each of the Parties to enter into and perform
this Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate to promptly obtain the Schering
Consent in writing.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                  Compensation

     3.1 Royalties

               (ii) for other countries in the Territory, [REDACTED] annual Net
          Sales,

on the Net Sales which occur in a country in which a Valid Claim exists.

          (b) Subject to Sections 3.1(c) and 3.3, royalties on Net Sales due

     (60) days after the end of each Accounting Period in which such Net Sales
     occur, commencing with the [REDACTED] in which the first Commercial Sale of
     any Product is made by Roche or any of its Affiliates; [REDACTED].

          (c) If the Licensed Compound from any Third Party becomes Effectively
     Commercially Available in a country in the Territory for use in the Field,
     Roche will not be obligated to pay the royalty in Section 3.1(a) for that
     country from that time. The Licensed Compound shall be considered
     "Effectively Commercially Available" in accordance with the following:

               (i) In the United States, the Licensed Compound will be
          considered Effectively Commercially Available upon the earlier of:

               (A)  a decision by any court in Japan or a decision by the
                    Japanese Patent Office in an opposition brought by a Third
                    Party, that all the claims of the Litigation Patents in suit
                    are wholly invalid or otherwise entirely unenforceable
                    [REDACTED]; or

               (B)  the issuance of Product Registrations to a Third Party in
                    Japan for an oral ribavirin product and the occurrence of

                    [REDACTED]; and

          (iv) In countries other than the United States, the EPC Countries and
     Japan (ROW Countries), the Licensed Compound will be considered Effectively
     Commercially Available:

               (A)  in all ROW Countries at any time an oral ribavirin product

               (B)  in a given ROW Country in the event of Unlicensed Third
                    Party Sales in commercial quantities in such country
                    [REDACTED].

     (d) If an Approval Authority imposes a price limitation for specific
indications or patients, [REDACTED], Ribapharm and Roche will discuss [REDACTED]
the applicable royalty [REDACTED].

     (e) At its sole discretion, Roche may obtain Product Registrations for a
Combined Product in any country in the Territory. Roche alone will have full
responsibility for obtaining such Product Registrations, and nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as preventing or limiting Roche from conducting any
Commercial Sales activities with the Combined Product in any manner whatsoever
[REDACTED] or requiring Roche to obtain any approval from Ribapharm or any of
its Affiliates relating to Commercial Sales of the Combined Product. Ribapharm,
however, may notify Roche in writing should Ribapharm reasonably believe a
material purpose for Roche's commercial activities with the Combined Product
[REDACTED] over a specified time period was for reducing the royalties that
otherwise would be due Ribapharm under this Agreement. Such notice shall include
(i) a detailed summary with supportive factual information of Ribapharm's basis
for its belief, and (ii) a specific suggestion of what adjustment should be made
to the Formula used in calculating Net Sales of the Combined Product [REDACTED].
If Roche agrees with Ribapharm that an adjustment to the Formula is appropriate,
the Parties will negotiate in good faith an adjustment. If, [REDACTED] after
Roche receives such notice, (i) Roche does not agree with Ribapharm that an
adjustment to the Formula is appropriate or (ii) the Parties can not agree on an
adjustment, then a Party may submit the matter to arbitration under Section 10.1
[REDACTED].

     (f) [REDACTED]

          (i) [REDACTED]

          (ii) [REDACTED]

     3.2 Most Favored Licensee

     In the event Ribapharm shall grant a right or license to sell the Licensed
Compound to any Third Party which has Effective Royalty Rates which are lower
than the royalty rates under this Agreement, then Ribapharm shall notify Roche
promptly in writing of the financial terms or any and all other consideration
which directly or indirectly relates to the grant of such right or license and
Roche shall have the right to adopt such Effective Royalty Rates of such Third
Party right or license as the royalty rates for this Agreement as of the
effective date of such Third Party right or license. Effective Royalty Rates as
used herein means [REDACTED]. In the event the Parties are unable to agree on
the computation of the Effective Royalty Rate, it shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with Section 10.1. For purposes of this provision, any
lowering of the royalty rates in the Schering License shall effectively
constitute the grant of a new right or license to sell the Licensed Compound.

     3.3 Extent of Royalty Obligations

         (a) Subject to Sections 3.3(c) and (e), the obligation of Roche to pay
theroyalty under Section 3.1 with respect to Product will commence on the first
Commercial Sale in a country in the Territory after the Effective Date and will
continue [REDACTED] in the Territory until termination or expiration of this
Agreement [REDACTED] or upon Effective Commercial Availability of the Licensed
Compound in [REDACTED].

         (b) Only one royalty payment shall be due on the sale of each unit of
Product under this Agreement.

         (c) [REDACTED] no royalties will accrue upon, and Net Sales will not
include, the disposition of Product that Roche or its Affiliates distribute,
free of charge, in good faith to address marketing challenges for the Product.
Such dispositions of Product shall include (i) samples (promotional or
otherwise), (ii) donations (for example, to non-profit institutions or
government agencies for a non-commercial purpose), (iii) use in investigator
initiated clinical studies, or (iv) use in patient assisted programs in the
Field (individually and collectively, No-Sale Distributions). Ribapharm may
notify Roche in writing should Ribapharm reasonably believe a material purpose
for Roche's No-Sale Distributions [REDACTED] over a specified time period was
for reducing the royalties that otherwise would be due Ribapharm under this
Agreement. Such notice shall include (i) a detailed summary with supportive
factual information of Ribapharm's basis for its belief, and (ii) a specific
suggestion of what adjustment should be made to Net Sales [REDACTED]. If Roche
agrees with Ribapharm that an adjustment to Net Sales is appropriate, the
Parties will negotiate in good faith an adjustment. If, within ninety (90) days
after Roche receives such notice, (i) Roche does not agree with Ribapharm that
an adjustment to Net Sales is appropriate or (ii) the Parties can not agree on
an adjustment, then a Party may submit the matter to arbitration under Section
10.1 as further described in Section 3.3(d).

         (d) Should an arbitration be commenced in accordance with Section
3.3(c), the arbitrator(s) shall be restricted to deciding only two issues:

             (i) Has Ribapharm demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence
that a material purpose for Roche's No-Sale Distributions of Product [REDACTED]
over a specified time period was for reducing the royalties that otherwise would
be owed to Ribapharm for sales of Product?

             (ii) Should the first issue be decided in favor of Ribapharm, what
adjustment should be made to the Net Sales [REDACTED] over the specified time to
compensate Ribapharm in accordance with the intentions of this Agreement, taking
into account the purposes motivating the No-Sales Distributions which are the
subject of the arbitration? In deciding this second issue, each Party will
submit to the arbitrator(s) what the Party believes would be a fair adjustment
to the Net Sales on account of the No-Sale Distributions, and the arbitrators
may only choose between one of these adjustments.

         (e) No royalties will accrue upon, and Net Sales will not include, the
disposition of Product by Roche or its Affiliates pursuant to Medical Needs
Programs



                                       10

<PAGE>

[REDACTED] to the extent that such dispositions if otherwise sold would have
amounted to less than [REDACTED] of the Net Sales for the given [REDACTED]
royalty period under Section 3.1(b). For those dispositions of Product under
Medical Needs Programs that exceed [REDACTED] in the given period, royalties
will accrue to such dispositions of Product as calculated at the [REDACTED] for
such Product.

     (f) Roche alone will have full responsibility for distributing the Product
(including the Combination Product or components thereof), such as No-Sale
Distributions under Section 3.3(c) or Medical Needs Programs under Section
3.3(e), and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing or
limiting Roche from distributing Product in any manner whatsoever or for
requiring Roche to obtain any approval from Ribapharm or any of its Affiliates.

     3.4 Payment Terms

     Roche will make all payments required under this Agreement in United States
Dollars. Any payments provided for under this Agreement that are not made when
due will bear interest at an annual rate until paid in full, equal to the 60-day
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus [REDACTED], as such rate may from
time to time fluctuate. Roche will make all payments under this Agreement to
Ribapharm by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account of
Ribapharm designated by Ribapharm from time to time in writing in accordance
with this Agreement.

     3.5 Taxes

         (a) All amounts owed under this Agreement will be paid after deduction
as required by law for all applicable taxes, fees, and other charges except
taxes imposed with respect to or based on a Party's net income. In particular,
any tax required to be withheld by Roche under the laws of any country for the
account of Ribapharm (withholding taxes) will be promptly paid by Roche for and
on behalf of Ribapharm to the appropriate governmental authority, and Roche will
furnish Ribapharm with proof of payment of such tax. All such tax actually paid
on Ribapharm's behalf will be deducted from royalty payments due Ribapharm or
promptly reimbursed to Roche if no further payments are due Ribapharm. Roche
will assist Ribapharm in claiming tax refunds at Ribapharm's request. Each Party
agrees to assist the other Party in minimizing the withholding taxes applicable
to any payment made by Roche, in claiming exemption from such withholding of
taxes of any type under any double taxation or similar agreement or treaty from
time to time in force, and in minimizing the amount required to be so withheld
or deducted.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.5(a), in the event of a
change in the United States-Switzerland income tax treaty which results in the
imposition by Switzerland or any of its political subdivisions of withholding
taxes on any royalty payment under this Agreement, Roche will pay to Ribapharm
an amount, in addition to all royalties payable under this Agreement, such that
after the deduction of all such taxes (including interest, penalties, or
additions to tax) Ribapharm receives the full amount of the royalty without
diminution for such taxes.

     3.6 Reports and Records

         (a) With each royalty payment made in accordance with Section 3.1(b)
Roche will deliver to Ribapharm a royalty report which includes the following
information:

             (i)   the total Adjusted Gross Sales for each Product subject to
royalty sold by Roche and its Affiliates [REDACTED];

             (ii)  Net Sales [REDACTED]; and

             (iii) total royalties payable to Ribapharm for the relevant period.

         (b) [REDACTED].

         (c) Roche and its Affiliates will keep, at Roche's principal place of
business, full, true, and accurate books of account containing all particulars
that may be necessary for the purpose of calculating all royalties payable to
Ribapharm with accounting principles consistently applied from period to period
in accordance with IAS.

         (d) At the expense of Ribapharm, Ribapharm or its authorized
independent public accountant may engage Roche's officially appointed worldwide
independent public accountant to perform, on behalf of Ribapharm or its
independent public accountant, an audit, conducted in accordance with
international accounting standards (IAS), of such books and records of Roche and
its Affiliates that are deemed necessary by Roche's independent public
accountant to report on Net Sales of Products for the period or periods
requested by Ribapharm and the correctness of any report or payments made under
this Agreement. Upon timely request and at least thirty (30) calendar days'
prior written notice from Ribapharm, such audit will be conducted as an
additional audit work during Roche's annual audit of the countries specifically
requested by Ribapharm, during regular business hours in such a manner as to not
unnecessarily interfere with Roche's normal business activities, and will be
limited to results in the two (2) calendar years prior to audit notification.
Such audit will not be performed more frequently than once per calendar year nor
more frequently than once with respect to records covering any specific period
of time.

         (e) All information, data documents, and abstracts herein referred to
will be used only for the purpose of verifying royalty statements or compliance
with this Agreement, will be treated by Ribapharm as confidential information,
and need not be retained beyond the longest of (i) one (1) year after completion
of an audit, if an audit has been requested, (ii) two (2) years from the end of
the calendar year to which such pertains, and (iii) one (1) year after the date
of termination of this Agreement. Audit work papers and results will be shared
by Roche and Ribapharm.

         (f) If the audit reveals an overpayment, Ribapharm will promptly
reimburse Roche for the amount of the overpayment. If the audit reveals an
underpayment, Roche will promptly make up such underpayment. If the audit
reveals that the royalties owed by Roche to Ribapharm for the countries
specifically requested and for any calendar year in total have been understated
by more than [REDACTED], Roche will, in addition, pay the reasonable costs of
such additional audit work. The failure of Ribapharm to request verification of
any royalty


                                       12

<PAGE>

calculation within the period during which corresponding records must be
maintained will be deemed to be conclusive acceptance of the royalty reporting
for the period to which the royalty pertains.

     3.7 Sales in Foreign Currencies

     Whenever for the purpose of calculating royalties, conversion from any
currency other than United States Dollars is required, such conversion will be
made as follows. When calculating the Adjusted Gross Sales, the amount of such
sales in currencies other than United States Dollars and Swiss Francs will be
converted into Swiss Francs as computed in Roche's central Swiss Francs "sales
statistics" for the countries concerned, using for internal foreign currency
translation Roche's then current standard practices actually used on a
consistent basis in preparing its audited financial statements in accordance
with IAS. When calculating the royalties on Net Sales, the Adjusted Gross Sales
calculated in Swiss Francs will be converted to United States Dollars using the
year to date average exchange rate as retrieved from the Reuters' system for the
applicable Accounting Period.

to one member of a Party will constitute disclosure to all members of the Party.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          Indemnification and Insurance

     6.1 Indemnification by Roche

     Roche will at all times, during and after the Term, indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless Ribapharm, ICN, their respective Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, and agents against all claims, demands, actions,
and liabilities (collectively, Claims), including reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs, arising out of or resulting from

         (a) each breach, if any, of any representation, warranty, or covenant
of Roche under this Agreement; or

         (b) each Third Party product liability claim or suit, if any, resulting
from the development, manufacture, marketing, import, use, or sale of Products
by Roche or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or from the performance by
Roche of its obligations under this Agreement.

     This indemnity obligation will not apply to the extent that Claims result
from any negligent act or willful misconduct of Ribapharm, ICN, their respective
Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents.

     6.2 Indemnification by Ribapharm and ICN

     Ribapharm and ICN will at all times, during and after the Term, indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless Roche, its Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents against all Claims arising out of or resulting
from each breach (respectively), if any, of any representation, warranty, or
covenant of Ribapharm or ICN under this Agreement.

     This indemnity obligation will not apply to the extent that the Claims
result from any negligent act or willful misconduct of Roche, its Affiliates, or
their respective directors, officers, employees or agents.

     6.3 Obligations of the Party Seeking to Be Indemnified

     If Ribapharm, ICN, Roche, or any Affiliate (in each case, an Indemnified
Party) receives any written Claim which it believes is the subject of indemnity
under this Agreement by Ribapharm, ICN or Roche, as the case may be (in each
case, an Indemnifying Party), the Indemnified Party will, as soon as reasonably
practicable after forming such belief, give notice to the Indemnifying Party,
including full particulars of such claim to the extent known to the Indemnified
Party. Failure to give timely notice to the Indemnifying Party will not release
the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is injured by such delay. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right, by prompt notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume
the defense of the claim at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the claim or, having done so,
does not pursue the defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense, with
counsel of its choice, but at the cost and for the account of the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
may participate through counsel of its choice, but the cost of such counsel will
be for the account of the Indemnified Party. The party not assuming the defense
of the claim will render all reasonable assistance to the party assuming the
defense, and all out-of-pocket costs of such assistance will be for the account
of the Indemnifying Party. No such claim will be settled other than by the party
defending the claim, and then only with the consent of the other party, which
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     6.4 Limits on Indemnification

         (a) All Claims for indemnification by an Indemnified Party must be made
(and will otherwise be irrevocably barred) prior to the later of (i) [REDACTED]
after the date the Indemnified Party first has substantial reason to believe a
Claim exists, or (ii) the date when all Claims first equal or exceed [REDACTED].

         (b) No Indemnified Party will make any Claims until the aggregate of
all Claims to date of a Party first equals or exceeds [REDACTED], at which time
all Claims to date and all Claims arising thereafter may be asserted.

         (c) The limitations in this Section 6.4 do not apply to the provisions
of [REDACTED].

                                  ARTICLE VII

                          Publicity and Confidentiality

     7.1 Publicity and Confidentiality

         (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or required by law
or the rules of any nationally recognized securities exchange on which
securities of a Party or any of its Affiliates are traded, no Party will
originate any publication, news release, or other public announcement, or
otherwise make disclosure to any Third Party, written or oral, whether in the
public press, stockholders' reports, or otherwise, relating to any and all
terms, including the


                                       17

<PAGE>

financial terms, of this Agreement, without the prior written approval of
the other Parties, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, within seven (7) days after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (or such shorter period as may be
required by law or the rules of any nationally recognized relevant securities
exchange), the Parties will issue a press release concerning the general nature
of this Agreement in form and substance agreed between the Parties prior to
publication.

         (c) If a Party is required to make disclosure in respect of this
Agreement under applicable laws or the rules of any nationally recognized
securities exchange, the disclosing Party [REDACTED] and consult with the other
Parties, and take into consideration another Party's comments thereon, prior to
such disclosure and, where applicable, will request confidential treatment to
the extent available.

         (d) Once information has been released in accordance with this Article,
the information contained in such release may be subsequently released by any
Party without the prior approval or consent of the other Parties.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

     this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2; and


                                       18

<PAGE>

         (iii) the default is not cured within [REDACTED] after the receipt of
such notice.

     (b) Either Party which is in not in default of its obligations hereunder
may terminate this Agreement upon written notice in the event any of the
contested proceedings between the Parties is not terminated in accordance with
the provisions of Article IV [REDACTED] days of the Effective Date, provided,
however, that if notwithstanding the good faith efforts of the other Parties
hereto the termination of such contested proceedings has not been completed by
the end of such [REDACTED] day period, the Parties hereto will agree on a
reasonable extension of such [REDACTED] day period in order to complete the
termination of such proceedings.

     (c) A Party may terminate this Agreement if at any time

          (i) another Party (other than a Party in the same group to which the
     Non-Breaching Party belongs) files in any court or agency pursuant to any
     statute or regulation of the United States or of any foreign country, a
     petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for reorganization or for an
     arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of the other
     Party or of its assets;

          (ii) another Party (other than a Party in the same group to which the
     Non-Breaching Party belongs) proposes a written agreement of composition or
     extension of its debts;

          (iii) another Party (other than a Party in the same group to which the
     Non-Breaching Party belongs) is served with an involuntary petition against

          (iv) another Party (other than a Party in the same group to which the
     Non-Breaching Party belongs) makes an assignment for the benefit of
     creditors.

     (d) Upon the occurrence of any event under Section 8.2(a)(iii) or Section
8.2(b) that entitles a Party to terminate this Agreement, such Party may deliver
to the other Party written notice of termination of this Agreement, and the
termination will be effective upon delivery of such notice. The right to
terminate will be in addition to and not in substitution of any other available
remedy.

     (e) [REDACTED]

     (f) Waiver by a Party of any event or succession of events giving rise to
the right of termination will not deprive the waiving Party of the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.2 on the basis of any subsequent
event giving rise to such right.

     8.3 Rights and Obligations Upon Termination or Expiration

     Expiration or termination of this Agreement or a license hereunder shall
not relieve the Parties of any obligation accruing prior to such expiration or
termination. Any expiration or

<PAGE>

a Party against the other accrued or accruing under this Agreement prior to

such termination.

     8.4 Surviving Provisions

     The Parties' rights and obligations under this Agreement will survive any
termination of this Agreement for the period of the statute of limitations

Agreement for any reason will be without prejudice to any rights accrued to the

obligations under this Agreement will also survive to the extent required for

under this Agreement.

the Party.

                               Dispute Resolution

     10.1 Arbitration

     Subject to compliance with Section 10.2, and other limitations on
arbitration as described elsewhere in this Agreement, any dispute, controversy
or claim arising under, out of, or in connection with this Agreement, including
any subsequent amendments will be referred to and finally be settled under the
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, France, in
force on the date of commencement of the arbitration by three arbitrators
appointed in accordance with those Rules. The place of arbitration will be New
York City, New York, and Delaware law will be applied. The language to be used
in the arbitral proceedings will be English. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
arbitrators in such proceedings may not make any determination as to the
validity or enforceability of any of the Licensed Patents.

     10.2 Pre-Litigation Dispute Resolution

     If a Party believes another Party has failed to comply with any of its
respective material obligations contained in this Agreement, the Party that
believes such obligation has not been fulfilled shall provide written notice to
the other Party concerning such possible non-compliance. The Party receiving
such notice shall have [REDACTED] after receipt of such notice to cure such
alleged non-compliance. In the event there is a dispute regarding the matter in
question, during such [REDACTED] period the Parties shall meet to discuss such
dispute. Should such discussion not resolve the dispute, then during such
[REDACTED] period, a Party may request that the unresolved dispute be referred
to the Chief Executive Officer of Ribapharm, or the President of ICN (if
appropriate), and the Head of the Pharmaceuticals Division of Roche to resolve
the dispute. In any event, if the matter in question is not resolved within
[REDACTED] after receipt of such notice, then either Party may proceed to
arbitration pursuant to Section 10.1. Nothing stated or left unstated in this
Article shall be deemed, directly, indirectly, expressly, or by implication, to
constitute a waiver of any rights that a Party may possess under this Agreement
or by law.

     10.3 Provisional Remedy

     Nothing in this Agreement limits the right of a Party to seek to obtain in
any court of competent jurisdiction any interim relief or provisional remedy,
including injunctive relief. Seeking or obtaining any interim relief or
provisional remedy in a court will not be deemed a breach or waiver of the
agreement in this Agreement to arbitrate.

     10.4 Royalty Dispute

     If a dispute between the Parties relates to the amount of royalties payable
under this Agreement, Roche will continue to pay Ribapharm not less than
[REDACTED] of the amount alleged by Roche in good faith to be payable, until the
dispute is resolved.

                               General Provisions

     11.1 Relationship of the Parties

     For purposes of this Agreement, the relationship of Ribapharm and ICN to
Roche is that of an independent contractor. Ribapharm, ICN and Roche are not
joint venturers, partners, principal and agent, master and servant, or employer
and employee. With respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, Ribapharm,
ICN and Roche have no power to bind or obligate each other in any manner, other
than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. A change of this relationship is
not precluded by this Agreement.

     11.2 Excusable Delay

     The failure or omission by a Party in the performance of any obligation
under this Agreement will not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or create any
liability if it arises from cause beyond the control of the Party, such as
strikes, riots, war, acts of God, invasion, fire, explosion, floods, delay of
carrier, shortage or failure in the supply of materials, energy shortage, and
acts of government or governmental agencies or instrumentalities. If due to such
an event either Party is delayed or hindered in or prevented from the
performance of its duties or doing acts required under the terms of this
Agreement, the performance of such act will be excused for the period of the
delay not to exceed ninety (90) days. A Party subject to such an excusable delay
will take all reasonable steps to resolve any condition forming the basis of the
delay.

instrument in writing executed and delivered by each of the Parties.

     11.7 Waiver

     A Party may extend the time for the performance of any obligations of
another Party, waive any inaccuracies and representations by another Party in
this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or waive
compliance by another Party with any of the covenants, conditions or performance
of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any such waiver must be in a
writing executed and delivered by the Party sought to be charged. Any such
waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such covenant, condition
or obligation will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

     11.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries

     This Agreement does not confer any rights, remedies, agreements,
undertakings, obligations, or liabilities on any person other than the Parties,
their Affiliates, and their respective successors-in-interest and permitted
assigns.

     11.9 Entire Agreement

     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior discussions,
negotiations, correspondence, agreements, and understandings, both oral and
written, between the Parties with respect thereto. There are no covenants,
promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions or understandings,
either oral or written, among the Parties that are material to the subject
matter of this Agreement other than as are set forth in this Agreement.

     11.10 Construction

     The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. If a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring a party because of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

     11.11 Counterparts

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
facsimile, each of which will be deemed to be an original and all of which
together will constitute one and the same agreement.

     11.12 Severability

     If any provision of this Agreement is finally determined to be invalid,
unlawful, or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, (a) (i) it will be deemed to be
severed from this Agreement in


                                       24

<PAGE>

such jurisdiction, (ii) every other provision of this Agreement will remain in
full force and effect in such jurisdiction, and (iii) the Parties will negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to achieve the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner with respect to such
jurisdiction, and (b) such invalidity, unlawfulness, or unenforceability will
not affect the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement in any other
jurisdiction.

     11.13 Joint and Several Liability of Roche

     The representations, warranties, covenants, and liabilities of Roche under
this Agreement are joint and several except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement.

     11.14 Bankruptcy

     All rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by
Ribapharm to Roche are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of
Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to "intellectual
property" as defined under Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Roche, as a
licensee of such rights under this Agreement, will retain and may fully exercise
all of its rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code.

     11.15 Remedies Cumulative

     The rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement are in addition
to any other rights available to them at law or in equity. The use of any right
or remedy by a Party does not preclude or waive the right to use any other
rights or remedies. This Section 11.15 does not relieve the Parties of their
obligations under Section 9.1 (Assignment) and Section 9.2 (Successors).

     11.16 Governing Law

     This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its principles governing
