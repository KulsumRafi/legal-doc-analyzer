4        TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OF DEBTS

                  Client shall deliver an Offer in respect of each such Debt
                  unpaid at that date. Venture shall only accept such Offer by
                  crediting the value of the Debt, as shown in the Offer, to the

                  such Debt shall be complete.

         (2)      The ownership of every Debt coming into existence after the
                  Commencement Date and until the ending of this Agreement shall
                  vest in Venture automatically upon such Debt coming into

                  Venture or the Client.

         (3)      Upon the vesting in Venture of each Debt pursuant to clauses
                  4(1) and 4(2) there shall also vest in Venture the ownership

         Debt or Related Rights owned by Venture. The Client shall hold in trust
         for Venture (and separately from the Client's own property) any Debt or
         Related Rights purchased by Venture of which the ownership shall fail
         to vest in Venture for any reason.

6        PURCHASE PRICE AND NOTIFICATION OF DEBTS
         ----------------------------------------

         (1)      Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement the Purchase
                  Price of each Debt, together with its Related Rights, shall be
                  equivalent to the amount payable by the Debtor in respect of
                  such Debt, including any tax or duty, according to the
                  relevant Sale Contract, after there has been deducted
                  therefrom:

                                      -1-

                  (i)      any discount, allowance or other deduction allowed or
                           allowable by the Client to the Debtor; and

                  (ii)     the Discount Charge in respect of such Debt,
                           calculated in accordance with clause 9(3).

         (2)      The Client shall promptly notify Venture of each Debt created
                  after the Commencement Date and vesting in Venture in such
                  manner and with such particulars and documents evidencing the
                  Debt as Venture may from time to time require. Notification
                  shall be as soon as the relevant Goods have been Delivered, or
                  at any other time if so required by Venture. A Notification
                  shall not include any Debt previously notified or subject to
                  an offer.

         (3)      If in relation to any Debt the Client is unable to give to
                  Venture every one of the warranties and undertakings contained
                  in this Agreement, then the Client shall notify such Debt to
                  Venture separately from other Debts and clearly mark the
                  relevant Notification to that effect. All such Debts shall be
                  Disapproved Debts.

                  Working Day credit the Purchase Price to the Debts Purchased
                  Account. For administrative convenience Venture may make such
                  credit before the deduction of any of the items which, in
                  accordance with clause 6(1), are to be deducted in computing
                  the Purchase Price. Venture may consequently, if it so wishes,
                  aggregate and debit all such items at any time thereafter to
                  either the Debts Purchased Account or the Current Account.

         (2)      Venture shall make appropriate accounting entries on the
                  Transfer Date to effect the transfer of the Purchase Price of
                  a Debt from the Debts Purchased Account to the credit of the

                                    shall identify it to be in respect of a
                                    specific Notified Debt;

                  or prospective (including liability to Venture as the customer
                  of another Client of Venture or for Value Added Tax). Where
                  the amount can not be immediately ascertained Venture shall be
                  entitled to make a reasonable estimate thereof. Until such
                  liabilities shall be so debited Venture may set off the amount
                  thereof against amounts payable to the Client.

                  use the Conversion Rate on the day it is so credited.

                  Foreign Currency Debt to the Current Account in accordance
                  with clause 7(2) Venture shall be entitled to use the
                  Conversion Rate on the Transfer Date. If the converted amount
                  of the Debt transferred is more than the converted amount of
                  the Purchase Price of that Debt, the difference shall be
                  treated as an increase in the Purchase Price and if it is
                  lower the difference shall be treated as a reduction in the
                  Purchase Price.

         (3)      On Recourse or Reassignment of any Foreign Currency Debt, the
                  Repurchase Price shall be computed by reference to the

                  writing) of the notified value of such Debt and credit notes
                  before the deduction of any discount or other allowance
                  allowed or allowable at any time to the Debtor. Venture shall
                  immediately debit the Factoring Fee to the Current Account.

         (2)      If the total Factoring Fees during the period of three months
                  immediately following the occurrence of a Right of Immediate
                  Termination shall be less than the total Factoring Fees during
                  the period of three months ended immediately before such right
                  shall arise, then the Client shall pay to Venture a sum equal
                  to the difference or Venture may debit the same to the Current
                  Account. This shall be payable even if this Agreement shall
                  end before the expiry of the three months and shall not affect
                  any other rights of Venture arising out of such events. Should
                  a Collection Transfer Fee become payable pursuant to clause
                  12(4)(ii) the relevant percentage for calculating the
                  Factoring Fee in respect of all Debts Notified thereafter
                  shall be the percentage stated in paragraph 17(ii) of the
                  Schedule as being the Revised Factoring Fee, in substitution
                  for that appearing in paragraph 15 of the Schedule.

         (3)      The Discount Charge to be deducted in computing the Purchase
                  Price of each Debt, in relation to which a Prepayment shall be
                  made, shall be equivalent to the rate per annum specified in
                  paragraph 16 of the Schedule (or such other rate as may be
                  agreed by the parties in writing) calculated daily, with

                  on which it is debited to the Current Account until four
                  Working Days after the Transfer Date. For administrative
                  convenience Venture may calculate the Discount Charge by
                  reference to the Funds in Use at the end of each day. The
                  total of the Discount Charges so calculated shall then be
                  debited monthly.

                           Credit Approved Debt;

                  (ii)     if so provided in paragraph 15 of the Schedule, all
                           banking charges and other costs and expenses it may
                           incur in relation to any account to which it directs
                           that any payments by Debtors shall be credited;

                  (iii)    such other charges or fees as are referred to in the
                           Schedule or any rider to the Schedule and all bank

                           converting the proceeds of a Foreign Currency Debt
                           into Sterling;

                  (iv)     any amount due to Venture in relation to the matters
                           referred to in clauses 14 and 18(2)(v);

                  (v)      any other amounts due to Venture.

         (5)      Any amount debited to the Current Account shall be treated as
                  a Prepayment for the purpose of calculating the Discount
                  Charge.

         (6)      All charges and fees to which Venture shall be entitled under
                  the terms of this Agreement shall be calculated or charged
                  exclusive of value added tax. Value added tax shall be payable
                  upon issue by Venture of a value added tax invoice.

                  (iii)    to issue promptly all credit notes due in respect of
                           Debts and to Notify same within three Working Days of

                           to clause 10(1)(iii) shall be treated as a reduction
                           of the Purchase Price of the Debt to which the credit

         (2)      Any Credit Limit may, in Venture's absolute discretion, be
                  increased, reduced or cancelled by Venture at any time. Any
                  increase must be by written or electronic notice to the Client
                  or by making the same available by electronic interrogation of
                  Venture's computer. Any such change shall take immediate
                  effect, except that no reduction or cancellation shall affect
                  any Debt which:

                  (i)      shall have arisen from Goods Delivered before the
                           service of notice on the Client of such reduction or
                           cancellation; and

                  (ii)     at the time of such service shall be (when totalled
                           with all other Debts owing by the Debtor) within the
                           Credit Limit.

         (3)      Where two or more Debts are owing by the same Debtor they
                  shall be treated as falling within the Credit Limit in the
                  order in which they are Notified.

         (4)      When a Credit Approved Debt shall be discharged by a Debtor
                  then the next Debt in the order referred to in clause 13(3)
                  shall become a Credit Approved Debt to the extent that it
                  falls within a Credit Limit.

         (5)      When Credit Approved Debts and other Debts are owing by the
                  same Debtor Venture shall have the right to allocate any
                  payment by the Debtor or any credit or allowance granted by
                  the Client to the Debtor or any sum by way of dividend or
                  benefit in satisfaction of any Credit Approved Debt in
                  priority to any other Debt, despite any contrary allocation by
                  the Debtor or the Client.

         (6)      The Client shall not disclose to the Debtor or any third party
                  the amount of or absence of any Credit Limit or the reasons
                  for such Credit Limit.

14       CREDIT BALANCES
         ---------------

         The Client hereby irrevocably authorises Venture to make payment to any
         Debtor on account of or in settlement of any credit balance appearing
         on its account in the records of Venture, whether such credit balance
         arises from the issue of a credit note by the Client or otherwise.
         Until such payment shall be made by Venture any such credit balance
         shall be a prospective liability of the Client to Venture.

15       RECOVERY OF VALUE ADDED TAX
         ---------------------------

         (1)      For the purpose of enabling the client to recover from H.M.
                  Customs and Excise any value added tax included in any Credit
                  Approved Debt unpaid for such period as would have enabled the
                  Client to make a claim for value added tax bad debt relief but
                  for its assignment to Venture, the following provisions shall
                  apply.

         (2)      Venture may reassign the Debt to the Client for a
                  consideration equal to the amount of value added tax included
                  in the Debt and any dividend or benefit recovered. The Client
                  also irrevocably authorises Venture in the name of the Client
                  to submit a proof of debt in the estate of the relevant
                  Debtor.

         (3)      The Client shall immediately upon receipt pay to Venture (or
                  in Venture's absolute discretion Venture may debit the Current
                  Account with) and meanwhile hold in trust for Venture the
                  amount of any dividend or other benefit received or receivable
                  in reduction of such Debt.

         (4)      On the Transfer Date Venture may set off against the Purchase
                  Price of an Outstanding Credit Approved Debt the amount of any
                  value added tax included in the Debt.

         (5)      Any payment by Venture to the Client in respect of a Credit
                  Approved Debt shall not discharge the consideration due from
                  the Debtor to the Client for the taxable supply.

                           (a)      to pay Venture upon demand any sum which may
                                    actually or contingently be payable by
                                    Venture to its bankers under the Indemnity;

                                    suffered, claimed and/or made against
                                    Venture under the Indemnity.

                           confidential and to change access codes when a person
                           with such knowledge leaves their organisation;

                  (v)      to pay to Venture all charges which Venture may from
                           time to time notify to the Client as being payable in
                           respect of the provision by Venture at the Client's
                           request of any on-site technical assistance in
                           respect of the Services.

                  (iv)     to keep secret and confidential the method of
                           operation of the Services, user identification codes,
                           passwords, test keys, access codes and security
                           procedures;

                  (v)      to notify the other promptly if it learns or suspects
                           that there has occurred any failure or delay in
                           receiving or transmitting any Message, any error or
                           fraud in affecting the sending or receiving of any
                           Message or any programming error or defect or
                           corruption of any Message, and to co-operate with the
                           other party in trying to remedy the same;

                  (vi)     to take all such appropriate steps and establish and
                           maintain all appropriate procedures so as to ensure
                           that as far as reasonably practicable Messages are
                           properly stored, are not accessible to unauthorised
                           persons, are not altered, lost or destroyed, and are
                           capable of being retrieved only by properly
                           authorised persons;

                  (vii)    to ensure that any Message containing confidential
                           information as designated by the sender of the
                           Message is maintained by the recipient in confidence
                           and is not disclosed to any unauthorised person or
                           used by the recipient other than for the purposes of
                           the business transaction to which it relates.
                           Messages shall not be regarded as containing
                           confidential information to the extent that such
                           information is in the public domain, or the recipient
                           is already in receipt of it prior to transmission by
                           the sender or receives the information from a third
                           party entitled to disclose it. Any authorised
                           disclosure to another person shall be on the same
                           terms as to confidentiality as required by the sender
                           or as contained in this clause;

                  (viii)   upon becoming aware of any breach of security in
                           relation to any Message or the Electronic Data
                           Interchange Facility, or in relation to the
                           procedures implemented under this clause, to
                           immediately inform the other party to this Agreement
                           of such breach and shall use all reasonable
                           endeavours to rectify the cause of such a breach as
                           soon as possible;

                  (ix)     to notify the other party immediately if it knows of
                           or suspects any misuse or likely misuse of, or breach
                           or likely breach of secrecy in respect of the
                           Services, any Message (or any part thereof) or any
                           passwords, access codes or other similar information.

         (5)      Where permitted by law, the parties may apply special
                  protection to Messages by encryption thereof or by any other
                  agreed means.

         (6)      Logging & Copyright

                  (i)      Venture's Master Log of Messages and data received or
                           transmitted by Venture shall in the absence of
                           manifest error, be conclusive proof and evidence of

                                      -16-




<PAGE>

                           the Messages sent or received by Venture in
                           connection with or referable to the Services and of
                           the constituents of such Messages and the times at
                           which they were sent or received.

                  (ii)     The copyright and all other rights in Venture's web
                           site and in any software used or provided by Venture
                           or Venture's licensors in connection with Venture's
                           web site or the Services shall at all times remain
                           vested in Venture, or if the terms of any contract
                           that Venture has with any licensor, otherwise
                           specified, in such licensor. The Client will not copy
                           any of the same without Venture's prior written
                           consent.

         (7)      Liability

                  (i)      Every message sent by the Client must identify the
                           sender. Venture may accept and act upon any message
                           ostensibly sent by the Client even though it may not
                           originate from the Client or the person purporting to
                           send the message shall lack authority and Venture
                           shall be under no obligation to enquire as to any
                           such matter;

                  (ii)     The Client accepts that data available through the
                           Services will be subject to change during the hours
                           of business each day, particularly the details of
                           items posted to the accounts of the Client with
                           Venture and Venture shall not in any circumstances
                           whatsoever have any liability to the Client for a
                           change in such data occurring after the Client shall
                           have acted in reliance thereon. In particular the
                           Client should under no circumstances initiate payment
                           to any third party based upon a message purporting to
                           show that monies may be drawn by the Client from
                           Venture. Venture shall confirm in accordance with its
                           normal procedures the transmission of payments to the
                           Client which payments shall only be made in
                           accordance with the terms of the Agreement;

                  (iii)    Venture shall not be liable for or in respect of any
                           loss or damage or any failure to comply, or any delay
                           in complying with its obligations hereunder or any
                           other obligation in respect of the Services which is
                           caused directly or indirectly by;

                           (a)      any downtime, unavailability, failure or
                                    malfunction of any computer hardware
                                    equipment or software, or of any telephone
                                    line or other communication system, service,
                                    link or equipment, whether the property of
                                    Venture or the Client or any Internet
                                    service provider or any other party;

                           (b)      suspension, alteration or withdrawal of the
                                    Services;

                           (c)      any error, discrepancy, corruption,
                                    incorrect formatting of or ambiguity in any
                                    Message received by Venture;

                           (d)      industrial dispute, abnormal operating
                                    conditions, act or omission of the Client or
                                    any third party;

                           (e)      force majeure;

                   (iv)    Venture shall not be liable to the Client for any
                           consequential, special secondary or indirect loss or
                           damage or any loss of or damage to goodwill, profits
                           or anticipated savings suffered by the Client by
                           reason of any of the matters referred to in clause
                           22.4 (1) to (ix) inclusive (however caused);

                  (v)      The Client hereby agrees to indemnify Venture and
                           keep Venture indemnified against all liabilities,
                           damages and expenses arising out of the transmission
                           or the receipt by Venture of incorrect, corrupted,
                           ambiguous or inaccurate Messages (however caused);

                                      -17-




<PAGE>

                  (vi)     All terms and conditions implied into this Agreement
                           by law are expressly excluded to the fullest extent
                           permissible by law;

                  (vii)    Nothing in this clause 22.6 shall operate to excuse
                           Venture from liability for loss or damage caused to
                           or suffered by the Client which loss or damage is
                           directly attributable to the negligence or fraud of
                           any of Venture's officers.

         (8)      Messages

                  (i)      Each party agrees to accord the messages the same
                           status as would be accorded to a document or to
                           information sent other than by electronic means,
                           unless such Messages can be shown to have been
                           corrupted during or upon transmission to Venture;

                  (ii)     Where there is evidence that a Message has been
                           corrupted or if any Message is identified or capable
                           of being identified as incorrect it shall be
                           re-transmitted by the sender as soon as practicable
                           with a clear indication that it is a corrected
                           Message. Any liability of the sender which would
                           otherwise accrue from the sender's failure to comply
                           with the provisions of this clause 22.8(ii) shall not
                           accrue if clause 22.8(iii) applies;

                  (iii)    Notwithstanding clauses 22.8(i) and 22.8(ii) Venture
                           will not be liable for the consequences of an
                           incomplete or incorrect Message if the error is or
                           should in all the circumstances be reasonably obvious
                           to the Client. In such event the Client must
                           immediately notify Venture thereof;

                  (iv)     If the recipient has reason to believe that a Message
                           is not intended for him he should notify the sender
                           and should delete from his system the information
                           contained in such Message but not the record of its
                           receipt.

         (9)       Suspension and Withdrawal

                  (i)      Venture shall have the right without liability to the
                           Client and without notice, at any time and from time
                           to time, to suspend the operation of the Services
                           whereupon no further Messages shall be sent or
                           enquiries made by either party until Venture has
                           agreed to re-activate the Services;

                  (ii)     This service can be suspended or withdrawn for any
                           reason, clauses 22.(1), 22.(2) and 22.(9) shall
                           survive withdrawal of this Service;

                  (iii)    Withdrawal of this service shall not affect any
                           action required to complete or implement Messages,
                           which are received by either of the parties prior to
                           such withdrawal.

         (10)     General

                  Venture shall provide to the Client a telephone number and
                  e-mail address for access to Venture's "help desk" support for
                  the Services. Venture is not bound to maintain the
                  availability of the "help desk" and when available the "help
                  desk" will be staffed by Venture only during Venture's normal
                  business hours. The "help desk" will only provide assistance
                  with regard to the Services and not in respect of any other
                  software applications.
