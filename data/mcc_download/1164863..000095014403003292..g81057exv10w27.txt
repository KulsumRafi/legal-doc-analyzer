                                                                   -------------


                         MANAGEMENT CONTINUITY AGREEMENT


         THIS AGREEMENT dated as of this 1st day of August, 2002 between Donald
G. Pomeroy II (the "Executive") and EnPro Industries, Inc., a North Carolina
corporation (the "Company").

         WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of
its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel
in the event there is, or is threatened, a change in control of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the uncertainty and questions
which may arise among key management in connection with the possibility of a
change in control may result in the departure or distraction of key management
personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide certain protection to Executive
in the event of a change in control of the Company as set forth in this
Agreement in order to induce Executive to remain in the employ of the Company
notwithstanding any risks and uncertainties created by the possibility of a
change in control of the Company;

                                   WITNESSETH:

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
promises herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

         1. TERM. The "Term" of this Agreement shall mean the period commencing
on the date hereof and ending eighteen (18) months after such date; provided,
however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on each
annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof
shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), the Term shall be
automatically extended so as to terminate eighteen (18) months from such Renewal
Date, unless at least sixty (60) days prior to the Renewal Date the Company
shall give notice to the Executive that the Term shall not be so extended.

         2. PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT. Executive's "Period of Employment" shall
commence on the date on which a Change in Control occurs during the Term and
shall end on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date on which such
Change in Control occurs (subject to the provisions of Section 20 below pursuant
to which the Period of Employment may be deemed to have commenced prior to the
date of a Change in Control in certain circumstances).

         3. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

                  "Cause" shall mean Executive's termination of employment with
         the Company due to (A) the willful and continued failure by Executive
         to substantially perform Executive's duties with the Company, which
         failure causes material and demonstrable injury to the Company (other
         than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity


<PAGE>

         due to physical or mental illness), after a demand for substantial
         performance is delivered to Executive by the Board which specifically
         identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive has
         not substantially performed Executive's duties, and after Executive has
         been given a period (hereinafter known as the "Cure Period") of at
         least thirty (30) days to correct Executive's performance, or (B) the
         willful engaging by Executive in other gross misconduct materially and
         demonstrably injurious to the Company. For purposes hereof, no act, or
         failure to act, on Executive's part shall be considered "willful"
         unless conclusively demonstrated to have been done, or omitted to be
         done, by Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that
         Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the
         Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed
         to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have
         been delivered to Executive a Notice of Termination which shall include
         a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
         than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting
         of the Board called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice
         to Executive and an opportunity for Executive, together with
         Executive's counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the
         good faith opinion of the Board Executive was guilty of conduct set
         forth above in clause (A) (including the expiration of the Cure Period
         without the correction of Executive's performance) or clause (B) above
         and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

                  "Change in Control" shall mean:

                           (i) The acquisition by any individual, entity or

                  Act")), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
                  13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of
                  either (A) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
                  Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (B) the
                  combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
                  securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
                  election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting
                  Securities"); provided, however, that the following
                  acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control: (A) any
                  acquisition directly from the Company (other than by exercise
                  of a conversion privilege), (B) any acquisition by the Company
                  or any of its subsidiaries, (C) any acquisition by any
                  employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
                  maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (D)
                  any acquisition by any company with respect to which,
                  following such acquisition, more than 70% of, respectively,
                  the then outstanding shares of common stock of such company
                  and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
                  securities of such company entitled to vote generally in the
                  election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or
                  indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and
                  entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the
                  Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company
                  Voting Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in
                  substantially the same proportions as their ownership, solely
                  in their capacity as shareholders of the Company, immediately
                  prior to such

                  such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement among
                  Goodrich Corporation, EnPro Industries, Inc. and Coltec
                  Industries Inc), constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board")
                  cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
                  Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
                  director subsequent to the Distribution Date whose election,
                  or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was
                  approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
                  then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as
                  though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board,
                  but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
                  initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an
                  actual or threatened election contest; or

                           (iii) consummation of a reorganization, merger or
                  consolidation, in each case, with respect to which all or

                  beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company
                  Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities
                  immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or
                  consolidation, do not, following such reorganization, merger

                  than 70% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
                  common stock and the combined voting power of the then
                  outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in
                  the election of directors, as the case may be, of the company
                  resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation in
                  substantially the same proportions as their ownership,
                  immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or
                  consolidation of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and
                  Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be; or

                  other than to a company, with respect to which following such
                  sale or other disposition, more than 70% of, respectively, the

                  indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and
                  entities, solely in their capacity as shareholders of the
                  Company, who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the
                  Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company
                  Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other

                           for each such Plan Cycle shall be adjusted in
                           accordance with the formula set forth in the
                           applicable LTIP award agreement based on the
                           performance for the Plan Cycle determined under
                           paragraph (A) above.

                                    (C) The pro rata portion of the "calculated
                           market value" of the number of phantom Performance
                           Shares adjusted in accordance with paragraph (B)
                           above shall be based on the number of calendar days
                           in the Plan Cycle completed through the Date of
                           Termination.

Section 5(c) below sets for the method for determining the "target incentive
amount" under the Annual Performance Plan and the "calculated market value" of
phantom Performance Shares under the LTIP. Any amounts payable under Sections
5(a)(ii) or (iii) above shall be offset dollar-for-dollar by any pro rata
payments otherwise provided for under the Annual Performance Plan or the LTIP.

                  (b) In lieu of any salary payments that Executive would have
received if he had continued in the employment of the Company during the Payment
Period, the Company shall pay to Executive in a lump sum, by not later than the
fifth business day following the Date of Termination, an amount equal to
one-twelfth of Executive's annualized base salary in effect immediately prior to
the Date of Termination, multiplied by the number of months in the Payment
Period.

                  (c) By not later than the fifth day following the Date of
Termination, the Company shall pay Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to
the sum of:

                           (i) under the Annual Performance Plan (and in lieu of
                  any further awards under the Annual Performance Plan that
                  Executive would have received if he had continued in the
                  employment of the Company during the Payment Period), the
                  number of months in the Payment Period multiplied by the
                  greatest of one-twelfth of: (A) the amount most recently paid
                  to Executive for a full calendar year; (B) Executive's "target
                  incentive amount" for the calendar year in which his Date of
                  Termination occurs; or (C) Executive's "target incentive
                  amount" in effect prior to the Change in Control for the
                  calendar year in which the Change in Control occurs; plus, if
                  applicable,

                           (ii) under the LTIP (and in lieu of any further
                  grants under the LTIP that Executive would have received if he
                  had continued in the employment of the Company during the
                  Payment Period), twelve (12) multiplied by the greatest of:
                  (A) with respect to the most recently completed Plan Cycle as
                  of the Date of Termination, one-twelfth of the "calculated
                  market value" of the Performance Shares actually awarded
                  Executive (including the value of any Performance Shares
                  Executive may have elected to defer under the Performance
                  Share Deferred Compensation Program); (B) with respect to the
                  most recently commenced Plan Cycle under the LTIP (if
                  Executive is a participant in such Plan Cycle) prior to
                  Executive's Date of Termination, one-twelfth of the
                  "calculated


                                       7
<PAGE>

                  market value" of the phantom Performance Shares, if any,
                  awarded to Executive; or (C) with respect to the most recently
                  commenced Plan Cycle prior to the date of the occurrence of
                  the Change in Control, one-twelfth of the "calculated market
                  value" of the phantom Performance Shares, if any, awarded to
                  Executive.

         For purposes of this Section 5, Executive's "target incentive amount"
under the Annual Performance Plan for a given calendar year (i.e., the calendar
year in which the Date of Termination occurs or the Change in Control occurs, as
applicable) is determined by multiplying (i) Executive's annualized total gross
base salary for the calendar year by (ii) the incentive target percentage which
is applicable to Executive's incentive category under the Annual Performance
Plan for the calendar year. For purposes of this Section 5, the "calculated
market value" of each Performance Share actually awarded upon completion of a
Plan Cycle, Performance Share deferred under the Performance Share Deferred
Compensation Program or phantom Performance Share granted under the LTIP shall
be the mean of the high and low prices of the Company's common stock on the
relevant date as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
listing (or similar report), or, if no sale was made on such date, then on the
next preceding day on which a sale was made multiplied by the number of shares
involved in the calculation. The relevant date for Section 5(a)(iii) and clauses
5(c)(ii)(B) and 5(c)(ii)(C) is the date upon which the Compensation Committee
("Committee") of the Board of Directors awarded the phantom Performance Shares
in question; for clause 5(c)(ii)(A) the relevant date is the date on which the
Committee made a determination of attainment of financial objectives and awarded
Performance Shares (including any Performance Shares Executive may have elected
to defer under the Performance Share Deferred Compensation Program).

         Any payments received pursuant to Sections 5(c)(i) or (ii) above shall
be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any payments required to be made to
Executive as the result of the happening of an event that would constitute a
change in control pursuant to the provisions of the Annual Performance Plan or
LTIP, as applicable.

         (d) If Executive is under age 55, or over the age of 55 but not
eligible to retire, at the Date of Termination the Company shall maintain in
full force and effect, for Executive's continued benefit, for the Payment
Period, all health and welfare benefit plans and programs or arrangements in
which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of
Termination (or such other comparable plans, programs or arrangements that
provide, in the aggregate, benefits which have an economic value at least as
favorable to Executive as those plans, programs and arrangements in which
Executive participated prior to the Date of Termination), as long as Executive's
continued participation is possible under the general terms and provisions of
such plans and programs. In the event that Executive's participation in any such
plan or program is barred or modified, the Company shall provide Executive with
benefits substantially similar to those to which Executive would have been
entitled to receive under such plans and programs, had Executive continued to
participate in them as an Executive of the Company plus an amount in cash equal
to the amount necessary to cause the amount of the aggregate after-tax
compensation and employee benefits Executive receive pursuant to this provision
to be equal to the aggregate after-tax value of the benefits which Executive
would have received if Executive continued to receive such benefits as an
employee. If Executive is age 55 or over and eligible to retire on the Date of
Termination, the Company shall provide


                                       8
<PAGE>

Executive with those health and welfare benefits to which Executive would be
entitled under the Company's general retirement policies if Executive retired on
the Date of Termination with the Company paying that percentage of the premium
cost of the plans which it would have paid under the terms of the plans in
effect immediately prior to the Change of Control with respect to individuals
who retire at age 65, regardless of Executive's actual age on the Termination
Date, provided such benefits would be at least equal to those which would have
been payable if Executive had been eligible to retire and had retired
immediately prior to the Change in Control.

         (e) The Company shall for the Payment Period continue, and Executive
shall be entitled to receive fringe benefit programs, perquisites, and similar
arrangements (which, by way of illustration and not limitation, shall include:
company car, health, dining and country club memberships, financial planning
services, telecommunications services, home security systems and the like) which
in the aggregate have an economic value at least as favorable to Executive as
those Executive was entitled to receive or participate in immediately prior to
the Date of Termination. In addition and notwithstanding any provision of the
Company's 2002 Equity Compensation Plan (or any comparable equity award plan of
the Company) or any applicable award agreement thereunder to the contrary,
Executive may exercise any of Executive's stock options that are vested as of
Executive's Date of Termination at any time during the Payment Period (but not
exceeding the original expiration date of the options).

         (f) The Company shall, in addition to the benefits to which Executive
is entitled under the retirement plans or programs sponsored by the Company or
its affiliates in which Executive participates (including without limitation any
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan in which Executive participates, if
applicable), pay Executive in a lump sum in cash by no later than the fifth day
following the Date of Termination an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of
the retirement pension to which Executive would have been entitled under the
terms of such retirement plans or programs had Executive accumulated additional
years of continuous service under such plans equal in length to Executive's
Payment Period. The length of the Payment Period will be added to total years of
continuous service for determining vesting, the amount of benefit accrual, to
the age which Executive will be considered to be for the purposes of determining
eligibility for normal or early retirement calculations and the age used for
determining the amount of any actuarial reduction. For the purposes of
calculating the additional benefit accrual under this paragraph, the amount of
compensation Executive will be deemed to have received during each month of
Executive's Payment Period shall be equal to the sum of Executive's annual base
salary prorated on a monthly basis as provided for under Section 4(a)
immediately prior to the Date of Termination (including salary increases), plus
under the Company's Annual Performance Plan the greatest of one-twelfth of:

                           (i) the amount most recently paid to Executive for a
                  full calendar year,

                           (ii) Executive's "target incentive amount" for the
                  calendar year in which Executive's Date of Termination occurs,
                  or


                                       9
<PAGE>

                           (iii) Executive's "target incentive amount" in effect
                  prior to the Change in Control for the calendar year in which
                  the Change in Control occurs.

Attached as Exhibit 1 is an illustration, not intending to be exhaustive, of
examples of how inclusion of the Payment Period may affect the calculation of
Executive's retirement benefit.

                  (g) In no event shall any amount payable to Executive
described in this Section 5 be considered compensation or earnings under any
pension, savings or other retirement plan of the Company.

         6. TERMINATION.

         (a) TERMINATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION. If Executive's employment is
terminated for any of the following reasons, Executive shall not be entitled by
virtue of this Agreement to any of the benefits provided in the foregoing
Section 5:

                           (i) If, prior to the commencement of the Period of
                  Employment, Executive's employment with the Company is
                  terminated at any time for any reason, including without
                  limitation due to (A) Executive's death, (B) an Incapacity
                  Discharge, (C) a termination initiated by the Company with or
                  without Cause or (D) resignation, retirement or other
                  termination initiated by Executive with or without Good
                  Reason, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 20
                  below.

                           (ii) If Executive's employment with the Company is
                  terminated during the Period of Employment with Cause.

                           (iii) If Executive resigns, retires or otherwise
                  voluntarily terminates employment with the Company during the
                  Period of Employment without Good Reason.

         (b) TERMINATION WITH COMPENSATION. If Executive's employment is
terminated for any of the following reasons, Executive shall be entitled by
virtue of this Agreement to the benefits provided in the foregoing Section 5 as
follows:

                           (i) If, during the Period of Employment, the Company
                  discharges Executive other than for Cause, Executive shall
                  receive all of the benefits and payments provided in Section
                  5.

                           (ii) Executive may terminate his employment with the
                  Company at any time during the Period of Employment for Good
                  Reason ("Good Reason Termination") and shall receive all of
                  the benefits and payments provided in Section 5.

                           (iii) If, during the Period of Employment, Executive
                  either (A) retires from employment with the Company or (B) if
                  the Company discharges Executive due to an Incapacity
                  Discharge, in either case while Executive has cause to


                                       10
<PAGE>


                  terminate his employment as a Good Reason Termination (whether
                  or not Executive has provided Notice of Termination to the
                  Company pursuant to Section 7), Executive shall receive all of
                  the benefits and payments provided in Section 5.

                           (iv) If Executive dies while employed by the Company
                  during the Period of Employment while having cause to
                  terminate his employment as a Good Reason Termination (whether
                  or not Executive has provided Notice of Termination to the
                  Company pursuant to Section 7), Executive's beneficiary or
                  beneficiaries named on Exhibit 2 to this Agreement (or
                  Executive's estate if he has not named a beneficiary) shall be
                  entitled to receive those payments provided under Sections
                  5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) of this Agreement in addition to any
                  benefits that such beneficiaries would be entitled under any
                  other plan, program or policy of the Company as a result of
                  Executive's employment with the Company.

                           (v) Executive may become eligible for the benefits
                  and payments under Section 5 for termination of employment
                  prior to a Change in Control in accordance with, and subject
                  to, the provisions of Section 20 below.

         7. NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any termination of Executive's employment by
the Company or any termination by Executive as a Good Reason Termination shall
be communicated by written notice to the other party hereto. For purposes of
this Agreement, such notice shall be referred to as a "Notice of Termination."
Such notice shall, to the extent applicable, set forth the specific reason for
termination, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's
employment under the provision so indicated.

         8. DATE OF TERMINATION. "Date of Termination" shall mean:

                  (a) If Executive terminates Executive's employment as a Good
Reason Termination, the date specified in the Notice of Termination, but in no
event more than sixty (60) days after Notice of Termination is given.

                  (b) If Executive's employment is terminated with Cause, the
date on which a Notice of Termination is given, except that the Date of
Termination shall not be any date prior to the date on which the Cure Period
expires without the correction of Executive's performance (if applicable).

                  (c) If Executive's employment pursuant to this Agreement is
terminated following absence due to physical incapacity as an Incapacity
Discharge, then the Date of Termination shall be thirty (30) days after Notice
of Termination is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned to the
performance of Executive's duties on a full-time basis during such thirty (30)
day period).

                  (d) A termination of employment by either the Company or by
Executive shall not affect any rights Executive or Executive's surviving spouse
or beneficiaries may have


                                       11
<PAGE>

pursuant to any other agreement or plan of the Company providing benefits to
Executive, except as provided in such agreement or plan.

         9. CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS.

                  (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or
distribution by the Company to Executive or for Executive's benefit (whether
paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 (or any successor provisions) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any interest or penalty is incurred by
Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any
such interest and penalties, is hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise Tax"), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment
(a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all
taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties
imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment,
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all
determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and
when such a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment
and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be
made by Ernst & Young (or their successors) (the "Accounting Firm") which shall
provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and to Executive
within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from Executive that
there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.
In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for
the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, Executive shall
appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations
required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment as determined pursuant to
this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to Executive within five (5) days
of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm
determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it shall furnish
Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on
Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the
imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive. As a result of
the uncertainty of the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of
the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made ("Underpayment"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies
pursuant to Section 9(c) And Executive thereafter is required to make a payment
of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the
Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid
by the Company to Executive or for Executive's benefit.


                                       12
<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim
by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon
as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after Executive or his
representative is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the
Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
requested to be paid. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration
of the thirty (30) day period following the date on which Executive gives such
notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any
payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies
Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to
contest such claim, Executive shall:

                           (i) give the Company any information reasonably
                  requested by the Company relating to such claim,

                           (ii) take such action in connection with contesting
                  such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing
                  from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting
                  legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney
                  reasonably selected by the Company,

                           (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in
                  order effectively to contest such claim, and

                           (iv) permit the Company to participate in any
                  proceedings relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection
with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of any such claim and may, at its sole option, either
direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any permissible manner, and Executive agree to prosecute such contest
to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial
jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall
determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs Executive to pay such
claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment
to Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold Executive
harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including
interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance
or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further
provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of
taxes for Executive's taxable year with respect to which such contested amount
is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore,
the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to
which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and Executive shall be


                                       13
<PAGE>


entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the
Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

                  (d) If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced
by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), Executive become entitled to receive
any refund with respect to such claim, Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the Company the
amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after
taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that
Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the
Company does not notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such
denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such
determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to
be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof,
the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

         10. NO OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES; NO EFFECT ON OTHER CONTRACTUAL
RIGHTS. Executive shall not be required to refund the amount of any payment or
employee benefit provided for or otherwise mitigate damages under this Agreement
by seeking or accepting other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of
any payment required to be made under this Agreement be reduced by any
compensation earned by Executive as the result of any employment by another
employer after the date of termination of Executive's employment with the
Company, or otherwise. Upon receipt of written notice from Executive that
Executive has been reemployed by another company or entity on a full-time basis,

reduced to the extent comparable benefits are made available to Executive at his
new employment and any such benefits actually received by Executive shall be
reported to the Company by Executive.

                  The provisions of the Agreement, and any payment or benefit
provided for hereunder shall not reduce any amount otherwise payable, or in any
way diminish Executive's existing rights, or rights which would occur solely as
a result of the passage of time, under any other agreement, contract, plan or
arrangement with the Company.

foregoing, Executive's right to receive payments hereunder shall not be

after a Change in Control for purposes of (i) this Agreement and both the Period
of Employment and the Payment Period shall be deemed to have begun on the day
prior to such termination and (ii) the Company's Equity Compensation Plan as if
the Change in Control had occurred on the day prior to such termination
(resulting in the full vesting and extended exercisability of the Executive's
outstanding stock options under, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Equity Compensation Plan).

                                    EXHIBIT 1

         A. If as of Executive's Date of Termination Executive's years of
continuous service under the applicable retirement plans for purposes of
determining eligibility for normal or early retirement plus the length of
Executive's Payment Period is at least 5, then

                  1. If as of Executive's Date of Termination Executive's age
         plus the length of Executive's Payment Period is at least 65,
         Executive's retirement benefit under Section 5(f) will be calculated as
         a "normal retirement" benefit to which Executive would have been
         entitled under the terms of the retirement plan in which Executive
         participates had Executive accumulated benefit service under the
         retirement plan that included the Payment Period; and

                  2. If as of Executive's Date of Termination Executive's age
         plus the length of Executive's Payment Period is at least 55 but less
         than 65, Executive's retirement benefit under Section 5(f) will be
         calculated as an "early retirement" benefit to which Executive would
         have been entitled under the terms of the retirement plan in which
         Executive participates had Executive accumulated benefit service under
         the retirement plan that included the Payment Period. The actuarial
         reduction used shall be the actuarial reduction factor for early
         retirement, calculated to Executive's actual age plus the length of
         Executive's Payment Period, at Executive's Date of Termination.

         B. If as of Executive's Date of Termination the sum of Executive's
years of continuous service under the applicable retirement plans for purposes
of determining eligibility for normal or early retirement plus the length of
Executive's Payment Period is less than 5, or Executive's age plus the length of
Executive's Payment Period is less than 55, Executive's retirement benefit under
Section 5(f) will be calculated as a "deferred vested pension" to which
Executive would have been entitled under the terms of the retirement plans in
which Executive participates had Executive accumulated benefit service under the
retirement plan that included the Payment Period. The actuarial reduction used
shall be the actuarial reduction factor for a deferred vested pension,
calculated to Executive's actual age at Executive's Date of Termination plus the
length of Executive's Payment Period.

         C. For purposes of Section 5(f), "actuarial equivalent" shall be
determined using the same methods and assumptions as those utilized under the
Company's retirement plans and programs immediately prior to the Change in
Control.
