     2.04 Certificate of Limited Partnership and Limited Partnership  Agreement.
The form of certificate of limited  partnership  attached to the  Certificate of

limited partnership of the Surviving Entity at the Effective Time and thereafter
until amended in  accordance  with  applicable  Law and the terms  thereof.  The

     2.06 Conversion of Securities.

          (a) Each  share of Target  Common  Stock  (other  than any  Dissenting
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of  Acquiror,  Target or
the  holders  of  such  shares  of  Target  Common  Stock,  but  subject  to the
effectiveness  of the Merger,  be canceled and  extinguished  and  automatically
converted  into  the  right  to  receive  the  Per  Share  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

          (b) All shares of Target  Preferred  Stock (other than any  Dissenting
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of  Acquiror,  Target or
the holders of such Target Preferred Stock, but subject to the  effectiveness of
the Merger,  be canceled and extinguished and  automatically  converted into the
right  to  receive  the  Aggregate  Preferred  Stock  Merger   Consideration  in
accordance with Section 2.08(b).

          (c) Any  shares of Target  Capital  Stock held in the treasury of
Target shall be canceled.

          (d) In the event any certificates  evidencing shares of Target Capital
Stock shall have been lost,  stolen or destroyed,  the Acquiror shall issue,  in
exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed  certificates,  that portion of the
Aggregate Merger  Consideration as such lost,  stolen or destroyed  certificates
would  entitle the  registered  holder of such Target  Capital  Stock to receive
under this  Section  2.06,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by such
registered  holder;  provided,  however,  that  Acquiror  may,  in its  sole and
absolute  discretion  and as a  condition  precedent  to the  issuance  thereof,
require the owner of such lost,  stolen or destroyed  certificates to provide an
indemnity  (without the posting of any bond)  against any claim that may be made
against  Acquiror with respect to such  certificates  alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

          (e) Until  surrendered  in accordance  with the  provisions of Section
2.08,  each share of Target  Capital  Stock (other than any  Dissenting  Shares)
outstanding  immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time  and  the  certificates
representing  such shares  ("Certificates")  shall,  after the  Effective  Time,
represent  for all  purposes,  only the right to  receive  that  portion  of the
Aggregate Merger  Consideration such share of Target Capital Stock would entitle
the holder thereof to receive hereunder.

          (f) No fractional  shares of Acquiror  Common Stock shall be issued in
the Merger.  All fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock that would otherwise
be a part  of the  Aggregate  Preferred  Stock  Merger  Consideration  shall  be
aggregated and if a fractional  share of Acquiror Common Stock results from such
aggregation, the Aggregate Preferred Stock Merger Consideration shall include an
amount  in cash  equal to the  value of  Acquiror  Common  Stock at the  closing
selling price on the first trading day immediately preceding the Closing.

          (g) For the purposes of this Section 2.06,  "Dissenting  Shares" shall
mean any  shares of Target  Common  Stock or Target  Preferred  Stock  held by a
holder  who has  satisfied  the  requirements  of  Article  5.12 of the  TBCA to
exercise his  dissenter's  rights with respect to such shares and who, as of the
Effective  Time,  has not ceased to be entitled to payment for his shares  under
Section  5.12 of the TBCA and has not waived his right to demand  payment  under
TBCA:

                    Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to the
          contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent a
          right to receive any  portion of the  Aggregate  Merger  Consideration
          pursuant to this Section  2.06,  but the holder  thereof shall only be
          entitled to such rights as are granted by the TBCA; and

                    Notwithstanding  the provisions of subsection (i) above,  if
          any holder of Dissenting  Shares shall cease to be entitled to payment
          for his shares under Section 5.12 of the TBCA or shall waive his right
          to  demand  payment  under  the  TBCA  then,  as of the  later  of the
          Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,  such holder's shares
          shall  automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
          receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger  Consideration as provided
          in this Section 2.06, without interest thereon,  upon surrender of the
          certificate  representing  such shares,  subject to the conditions set
          forth in this Agreement.

     2.07 [RESERVED.]

     2.08 Exchange of Certificate; Delivery of Aggregate Merger Consideration.

set forth next to his or its name on Exhibit C attached hereto.

     2.09 No Further  Transfer of Shares.  After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers of Target Capital Stock that were outstanding  immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective  Time,  Certificates or any other
securities of Target are presented to the  Surviving  Corporation  for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged  for that portion of the  Aggregate  Merger
Consideration as such  Certificates  would entitle the registered holder of such
Target  Capital  Stock to  receive  as  provided  in this  Article  2. As of the
Effective Time, the stock ledger of Target shall be closed.

     2.10 Closing . The  consummation of the  Transactions  contemplated by this

     2.12 Contingent Merger Consideration Payments.

          (a)  Subject to the  conditions  set forth in Section  2.12(b) of this
Agreement,  for each of the three (3) calendar years beginning with the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs (the "Contingent Merger Consideration Period"),
Acquiror will pay to Holders'  Representative,  as the  representative  of those
holders of Target  Capital Stock  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time, an
amount  equal to Two Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000)  (the "Yearly
Contingent Merger Consideration Amount").

          (b) Payment of the Yearly Contingent Merger  Consideration  Amount for
any year  shall be due only if Target  and the  Acquiror  Affiliated  Group have
achieved,  in such calendar year,  aggregate  revenue (net of any sales returns,
allowances or discounts) of Target and Acquiror  Affiliated  Group from the sale
of continuous  tubular products used in subsea umbilical and gas lift operations
("Contingent  Merger  Consideration  Revenue") of not less than sixteen  million
dollars  ($16,000,000)  ("Minimum  Contingent  Merger  Consideration  Revenue").
Contingent Merger Consideration Revenue shall not include non-continuous tubular
products sold by Target or the Acquiror  Affiliated Group or sales of continuous
line pipe  products or  continuous  downhole pipe products sold by Target or the
Acquiror  Affiliated  Group.  Acquiror shall prepare a computation of Contingent
Merger  Consideration  Revenue based on the financial statements of Acquiror for
each year during the  Contingent  Merger  Consideration  Period and will deliver
such computation to the Holders' Representative not later than 90 days after the
end of such fiscal year together with a certification  setting forth the name of
each member of the Acquiror  Affiliated  Group  included in the  computation  of
Contingent  Merger  Consideration  Revenue and that such members of the Acquiror
Affiliated Group are the only members of the Acquiror  Affiliated Group required
to be included in the calculation of Contingent Merger Consideration Revenue. If
within  15  days  following  the  delivery  of  such  computation  the  Holders'
Representative  has not  given  Acquiror  written  notice of  objection  to such
computation  (such  notice  must  contain  a  statement  of the  basis  of  such
objection),  then the  computation  shall be deemed to be  approved  by Holders'
Representative. If the Holders' Representative gives written notice of objection
within the time frame set forth above, any issues in dispute will be resolved in
accordance  with the  provisions of Section  2.12(c).  On the tenth business day
following the final determination of Contingent Merger Consideration Revenue, if
Minimum  Contingent  Merger  Consideration  Revenue has been achieved,  Acquiror
shall deliver the Yearly Contingent Merger  Consideration Amount to the Holders'
Representative  by wire transfer  pursuant to written  instructions  received by
Acquiror from the Holders' Representative.

          (c) If the  Holders'  Representative  objects  to the  calculation  of
Contingent Merger  Consideration  Revenue pursuant to Section 2.12(b),  then the
issues in dispute will be submitted to the St. Louis office of Deloitte & Touche
LLP (the "Accountants"),  for resolution.  If issues in dispute are submitted to
the Accountants  for resolution,  (i) each party will furnish to the Accountants
such work papers and other  documents and  information  relating to the disputed
issues as the  Accountants  may request and are  available  to that party or its
independent  public  accountants and will be afforded the opportunity to present
to the Accountants any material relating to the determination and to discuss the
determination   with  the  Accountants;   and  (ii)  the  determination  by  the
Accountants,  as  set  forth  in a  notice  delivered  to  both  parties  by the
Accountants,  will be  binding  and  conclusive  on the  parties;  and (iii) the
Holders  (collectively)  and  Acquiror  will  each  bear  50% of the fees of the
Accountants for such determination.

     2.13 Registration Statement.

          (a) Within five (5) Business  Days  following the date of execution of
this  Agreement,  Acquiror  will  prepare  and file with the SEC a  registration
statement (the "Registration  Statement") covering the total number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.08 of this Agreement
for an  offering  to be made on a  continuous  basis  pursuant  to Rule  415 (or
similar  rule  that may be  adopted  by the SEC)  under  the  Securities  Act in
accordance   with  the  intended   method  of   distribution   of  the  "Selling
Shareholders" (defined below).

          (b)  Acquiror  will use its  reasonable  best  efforts to (1) have the
Registration  Statement  declared  effective  by the SEC as  soon as  reasonably
practicable  following  its filing with the SEC, and (2) keep such  Registration
Statement  continuously  in effect  until the earlier to occur of (i) the second
anniversary of the date of the Closing, extended as necessary in accordance with
the  provisions  below  relating to the  suspension of the use of the prospectus
contained in the  Registration  Statement,  or (ii) the date on which all of the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock registered under the Registration  Statement are
eligible to be sold by the current  holders  thereof  pursuant to Rule 144 under
the  Securities  Act;  provided,  however,  that, in the event that, at any time
after such Registration  Statement is declared  effective,  Acquiror  determines
that an event or  circumstance  occurs and is  continuing  that (Y) has not been
publicly  disclosed  and, if not disclosed in the  Registration  Statement,  any
related  prospectus  or any document  incorporated  therein by reference as then
amended or supplemented  would,  in the judgment of the Acquiror,  result in the
Registration  Statement,  any related prospectus or any such document containing
an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitting  to state a material  fact
required to be stated  therein,  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein not misleading under the  circumstances  under which they were made, and
(Z) in the judgment of the Board of  Directors of Acquiror,  Acquiror has a bona
fide  business  purpose for not then  disclosing  the existence of such event or
circumstance,  Acquiror may suspend the use by the Selling  Shareholders  of the
prospectus  contained in the Registration  Statement of the Selling Shareholders
(the "Prospectus");  provided,  further,  however,  that the number of days that
Acquiror is required to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
pursuant to Section  2.13(b)(2)(i) above shall be extended by the number of days
that the use of the  Prospectus is  suspended.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Acquiror may not suspend the use of the  Prospectus for more than 45 consecutive
days and in no event for more than an  aggregate  of 45 days during any 12-month
period,  unless the Board of Directors of Acquiror, in its good faith reasonable
discretion  determines  that a longer period of suspension is required,  and for
only so long as such  longer  period  is  required,  in  order  to  prevent  the
disclosure of material information which would have a material adverse effect on
Acquiror.

          (c) Those  shareholders of Target  receiving shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in the merger who wish to sell any or all of such  shares  pursuant to the
Registration  Statement ("Selling  Shareholders")  shall, upon receiving written
notice from the Acquiror of the suspension of the use of any Prospectus pursuant
to Section  2.13(b)  above,  not effect  sales of any shares of Acquiror  Common
Stock pursuant to such Prospectus for a period  beginning on the date of receipt
of such notice and expiring on the date upon which such information is disclosed
to the public or ceases to be  material,  and in either case as  evidenced  by a
notice from Acquiror to such Selling Shareholder to that effect.

          (d)  Acquiror  will use its best  efforts  to cause  any  Registration
Statement or amendment,  including any prospectus and any  supplements  thereto,
and each report or other document incorporated by reference therein, when filed,
(i) to comply  as to form with the  requirements  of the  Securities  Act or the
Exchange Act, as applicable,  in all material respects,  and (ii) to not contain
any  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to  state a  material  fact
necessary  in  order  to make  the  statements  made  therein,  in  light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading;  provided,  however,
that Acquiror makes no  representation or warranty in respect of any information
that any of the Selling Shareholders provide to Acquiror for the express purpose
of inclusion in any Registration Statement.

          (e) As to  any  shares  of  Acquiror  Common  Stock  to be  registered
pursuant this Section 2.13, Acquiror covenants and agrees that:

               (i) Prior to their filing with the SEC, Acquiror shall furnish to
Locke,  Liddell & Sapp LLP,  counsel for Target,  for purposes of such counsel's
review  thereof,  copies  of the  Registration  Statement  and  all  amendments,
including any prospectus and any supplements thereto;

               (ii) It shall immediately  advise the Holders'  Representative in
writing  of the  occurrence  and  time of  occurrence  of each of the  following
events:  (A)  the  issuance  by the SEC of an  order  declaring  a  Registration
Statement  effective,  including any post-effective  amendment thereto;  (B) any
request by the SEC for an amendment of a  Registration  Statement as  originally
filed or as amended or as effective or for any  amendment or  supplement  to the
final  prospectus  or  preliminary  prospectus  contained  therein,  or for  any
additional  information  with  respect  to  a  Registration  Statement  or  such
prospectus or any  preliminary  prospectus;  (C) the occurrence of any event, of
which  Acquiror  had  knowledge,  during  the period of the  effectiveness  of a
Registration  Statement  which requires that such final  prospectus  included in
such  Registration  Statement  be amended or  supplemented  in order to make the
statements therein not misleading;  (D) the refusal to qualify or the suspension
of the  qualification  of such shares of Acquiror  Common  Stock for offering or
sale in any  jurisdiction,  or for the  institution of any  proceedings for such
purpose;  (E)  the  issuance  by the  SEC  of  any  stop  order  suspending  the
effectiveness of a Registration  Statement or any order suspending or preventing
the use of such final  prospectus  or any such  preliminary  prospectus,  or the
initiation of any proceedings  for such purpose;  or (F) the receipt by Acquiror
of any notification  with respect to the suspension of the  qualification of the
shares of Acquiror  Common Stock for sale in any  jurisdiction or the initiation
or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose;

               (iii) It shall  timely file all reports  required by the Exchange
Act and,  subject to the proviso in Section  2.13(b)  hereof,  promptly amend or
supplement a  Registration  Statement at any time during the required  period of
its effectiveness in order to make the statements therein not misleading,  or as
otherwise may be required by the  Securities  Act and the rules and  regulations
promulgated thereunder;

               (iv) It  shall  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  prevent  the
issuance of any stop order or any suspension of the  qualification (or exemption
from  qualification)  of any of the shares of Acquiror  Common Stock for sale in
any  jurisdiction  described in Section  2.13(e)(v)  below,  and, if issued,  to
obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest practicable moment;

               (v) In the event  the  shares of  Acquiror  Common  Stock are not
deemed a "covered  security"  pursuant to Section 18 of the  Securities  Act, it
will make every  reasonable  effort to qualify  such shares of  Acquiror  Common
Stock for  offering  and sale  under the  securities  or "blue  sky" laws of any
states in which the Selling  Shareholders  require such  qualification  and will
continue such qualifications in effect for so long as the Registration Statement
is in effect  for the  distribution  of the  shares of  Acquiror  Common  Stock;
provided, however, that Acquiror shall not be required in connected therewith to
qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any such state;

               (vi)  All  expenses  of  any  Registration  Statement,   and  all
amendments  and  supplements   thereto,   provided  for  in  this  Section  2.13
(including, without limitation, Acquiror's legal fees, accounting fees, printing
costs,  "blue  sky,"  SEC  filing  fees,  underwriting  discounts,  commissions,
brokerage fees, and fees of legal counsel for the Selling  Shareholders  arising
from or related to the  registration  or sale of the shares of  Acquiror  Common
Stock), will be borne by Acquiror;  provided that each Selling Shareholder shall
bear any discounts,  commissions, fees, or other amounts payable to underwriters
or brokers in connection with its sale of such Selling  Shareholder's  shares of
Acquiror Common Stock;

               (vii)  Acquiror  will  furnish  such  number  of  copies  of  the
prospectus,  including any  amendments or  supplements  thereto,  as the Selling
Shareholders  reasonably request in order to facilitate their disposition of the
registered shares of Acquiror Common Stock; and

               (viii)  Within  five  (5)  Business  Days  of the  date  of  this
Agreement,  Acquiror will file an  application  to list or include the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.08 of this Agreement
on each  securities  exchange  on which  similar  securities  are then listed or
included,  and Acquiror will thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such shares to be so listed or included as promptly as practicable.

     2.14 Obligations of Acquiror and the Selling Shareholders.


          (a) Acquiror  will  indemnify  each Selling  Shareholder,  each of its
directors, officers, employees, partners and agents, and each person controlling
such Selling  Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
and  Section  20  of  the  Exchange  Act,  with  respect  to  any  registration,
qualification or compliance  effected pursuant to Section 2.13,  against any and
all Losses (as such term is defined  in  Section  8.01(a)),  including  any Loss
incurred in settlement of any litigation,  commenced or threatened,  arising out
of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue  statement) of a material
fact contained in any registration statement,  prospectus,  offering circular or
other  document,  or any amendment or supplement  thereto,  incident to any such
registration,  qualification  or compliance or any  preliminary  prospectus,  or
based on any omission (or alleged  omission)  to state  therein a material  fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the  statements  therein not
misleading under the circumstances  under which they were made, or any violation
by Acquiror of the  Securities  Act, the Exchange  Act or state  securities  law
applicable to Acquiror in connection with any such  registration,  qualification
or compliance or any  preliminary  prospectus,  and shall reimburse each Selling
Shareholder,  each of its directors,  officers,  employees, partners and agents,
and each  person  controlling  such  Selling  Shareholder  within the meaning of
Section  15 of the  Securities  Act and  Section  20 of the  Exchange  Act,  for
reasonable  legal and other expenses that such Selling  Shareholder may incur in
connection with investigating, preparing or defending any claim by a third party
related thereto;  provided,  however,  that the indemnity agreement contained in
this Section  2.14(a)  shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Loss
if such  settlement is effected  without the consent of Acquiror  (which consent
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld)  nor shall  Acquiror be liable in any such
case for any Loss caused by any untrue  statement or omission (or alleged untrue
statement  or omission)  made in reliance  upon and in  conformity  with written
information furnished for or in connection with such registration by the Selling
Shareholder or its directors, officers, employees, partners, or agents.

          (b) Holders  will,  jointly and  severally,  indemnify  and  reimburse
Acquiror, each of its directors,  officers, employees,  partners, and agents and
each  person  controlling  Acquiror  within  the  meaning  of  Section 15 of the
Securities  Act or  Section  20 of the  Exchange  Act to the same  extent as the
indemnity  from the  Acquiror to each Selling  Shareholder  set forth in Section
2.14(a)  as  though  in  such  Section   2.14(a)   "Acquiror"   means   "Selling
Shareholders" and "Selling Shareholders" means "Acquiror," but only with respect
to any  Loss  arising  out  of  written  information  relating  to  the  Selling
Shareholders furnished to the Acquiror in writing by the Selling Shareholders or
their directors, officers, employees, partners or agents expressly for use in or
in  connection  with any  registration,  qualification  or  compliance  effected
pursuant to Section 2.13 or any preliminary prospectus. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 2.14(b),  the indemnity  agreement  contained in
this Section  2.14(b)  shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Loss
if such  settlement is effected  without the consent of the  applicable  Selling
Shareholder (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld). In addition, in
no event shall the  indemnity  provided by Holders  under this  Section  2.14(b)
exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by the Selling Shareholders.

          (c) If the  indemnification  provided for in this Section 2.14 is held
by a court of competent  jurisdiction  to be  unavailable  to any of the parties
entitled  thereto  under  this  Agreement  with  respect  to any Loss,  then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the party otherwise entitled to such
indemnification,  shall contribute to the amount paid of such Loss or payable by
such  parties in such  proportion  as is  appropriate  to  reflect  not only the
relative  benefits  received by the  indemnifying  party on the one hand and the
party entitled to such indemnification on the other, but also the relative fault
of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the party otherwise entitled to
such indemnification on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
or  actions  that  resulted  in Loss as well  as any  other  relevant  equitable
considerations;  provided,  however,  that in any such case, no person or entity
liable for a fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the  Securities  Act) will be  entitled  to  contribution  from any person or
entity that was not liable for such fraudulent  misrepresentation.  The relative
fault  of the  indemnifying  party  and  of  the  party  otherwise  entitled  to
indemnification shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged  untrue  statement  of a material  fact or the omission to
state a material fact relates to information  supplied by the indemnifying party
or by the party  otherwise  entitled to such  indemnification  and the  relative
intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such  statement  or  omission  of or by the  indemnifying  party  or  the  party
otherwise entitled to such indemnification.

     2.15 Registration on Transfer of Shares of Acquiror Common Stock.

          (a) All  certificates  for shares of Acquiror  Common Stock  delivered

               NO-ACTION  LETTER FROM THE STAFF OF THE  SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE
               COMMISSION."

          (b)  assuming  that this  Agreement  is the legal,  valid and  binding
agreement  of the  Acquiring  Parties,  then this  Agreement  is also the legal,
valid, and binding obligation of such Holder, enforceable against such Holder in

and full legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations  hereunder.  If such  Holder is not an  individual,  the  execution,
delivery and  performance  of this  Agreement  has been duly  authorized  by all
necessary  action and neither the execution  and delivery of this  Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, directly or indirectly
contravenes,  conflicts  with or results in a violation of any provision of such

existing  and in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of its
incorporation  and has all  requisite  corporate  power  and  authority  to own,
operate and lease its  properties  and to carry on its Business in the manner as

would have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Target has delivered to Acquiror  true,
complete  and correct  copies of the  Charter  Documents  of Target,  as amended
through  the  date  hereof.  Target  is not in  violation  of  any  its  Charter
Documents.  At the Closing,  all of the books of account,  minute  books,  stock
record books and other  records of the Target will be in the  possession  of the
Target.

Transaction  Document to which Target is a party.  The  execution,  delivery and
performance  of this  Agreement  by  Target  has  been  duly  authorized  by all
necessary corporate and shareholder  action.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing  sentence,  Target has disclosed to each of its  shareholders  all
information  necessary and required to be disclosed to such  shareholders  under
Texas Law. This Agreement and any other Transaction  Document to which Target is
a party has been duly  executed and  delivered by a duly  authorized  officer of
Target,  and this Agreement and the other Transaction  Documents to which Target
is a party  constitute  the  legal,  valid and  binding  obligations  of Target,
enforceable  against Target in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or  similar  laws  affecting  the  rights of  creditors  generally  and  general
principles of equity.

     4.03 Capital Stock of Target.

          (a) As of the date of this Agreement, Target has authorized (i) 94,000

and classes of Target Capital Stock held by such holders is set forth in Section
4.03 of the Disclosure Schedule.

          (c Except as set forth in  Section  4.03 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,
there are no outstanding options, warrants, convertible securities, Contracts or
rights of any kind to purchase or  otherwise  acquire  from Target any shares of
Target  Capital  Stock.  Except as set forth in Section  4.03 of the  Disclosure
Schedule,  no shares of Target  Capital  Stock are  reserved or  authorized  for
issuance.

          (d) All  outstanding  shares of Target  Capital  Stock  have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and were issued
in compliance  with all applicable  Charter  Documents of Target,  all Contracts
binding upon Target and all  applicable  federal,  state and foreign  securities
laws, rules and regulations.

          (e)  Other  than  as  set  forth  herein,   Target  currently  has  no
outstanding vote, plan or pending proposal involving any merger or consolidation
of Target with or into any other Person, any sale of Target Capital Stock or any
sale of assets of Target  other  than  inventory  and other  assets  sold in the
ordinary course of business.

          (f) Except as set forth in Section  4.14 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,
there are no Contracts among any Persons which affect or relate to the voting or
giving of written consents with respect to any Target Capital Stock.

     4.04 Interest in Other  Entities.  Target has no  Subsidiaries  and owns no
equity  security of any Person and has no other  ownership  or other  investment
interest, either of record, beneficially or equitably, in any Person, except for
bank, checking and money market accounts and other cash equivalent investments.

     4.05 No  Conflicts.  Except for the items set forth in Section  4.05 of the
Disclosure Schedule,  the execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Target  does not  contravene  or violate  (a) any Law or Court Order to which
Target is subject or (b) the  Charter  Documents  of Target,  or any  securities
issued by Target;  nor does such execution,  delivery or  performance,  conflict
with or result  in a Default  under any  term,  condition  or  provision  of, or
require the consent of any other party to, any Contract, indenture, plan, or any
Governmental  Permit to which Target is a party, by which Target may have rights
or by which any of the  Assets of Target may be bound or  affected,  or give any
party with rights  thereunder  the right to consent to or receive  notice of the
Transaction,  terminate,  modify,  accelerate  or otherwise  change the existing
rights or obligations of Target thereunder.

     4.06  Financial  Statements;  Books of  Account.  Target has  delivered  to
Acquiror  (a) true,  complete  and correct  copies of Target's  audited  balance
sheets as of September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 and audited statements of income,
changes  in  stockholders'  equity  and cash  flows  for the  years  then  ended
(collectively,  the "Audited Financial Statements");  and (b) true, complete and
correct copies of Target's  unaudited balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 (the
"Interim  Balance  Sheet"  and the  date of the  Interim  Balance  Sheet  is the
"Interim  Balance  Sheet Date") and  statement of income for the 3-month  period
then ended (such income statement,  together with the Interim Balance Sheet, the
"Interim  Financial  Statements" and,  collectively  with the Audited  Financial
Statements, the "Target Financial Statements"). Target Financial Statements have
been  prepared in accordance  with GAAP,  subject to, in the case of the Interim
Financial  Statements,  the omission of footnote information and normal year-end
adjustments.  The Target  Financial  Statements  present  fairly in all material
respects  the  financial  position  of Target as of the  dates  thereof  and the
results of its operations  and cash flows (in the case of the Audited  Financial
Statements)  for the periods then ended,  in each case in accordance  with GAAP,
except  for,  in the case of  Interim  Financial  Statements,  the  omission  of
footnote  information  and normal year end  adjustments.  Except as set forth in
Section 4.06 of the Disclosure Schedule,  the books of account of Target reflect
in all  material  respects  its items of  income  and  expense  and  assets  and
liabilities required to be reflected therein in accordance with GAAP.

     4.07 Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable.

          (a) All accounts  receivable that are reflected on the Interim Balance
Sheet represent valid  obligations  arising from sales actually made or services
actually  performed  by Target in the  ordinary  course  and are not  subject to
defenses,   set-offs  or  counterclaims,   and  such  accounts   receivable  are
collectible net of the reserve shown on the Interim Balance Sheet (which reserve
is calculated consistent with past practice).  Section 4.07(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule  sets forth a true and correct  aging as of the Interim  Balance  Sheet
Date of the accounts receivable shown on the Interim Balance Sheet.

          (b) All  accounts  payable that are  reflected on the Interim  Balance
Sheet have been incurred or have arisen only in the ordinary course. There is no
dispute or claim with any account  creditor  of any such  account  payable  that
could result in any such account  payable being due in greater than its recorded
amount, nor is there any reason to believe that any of the foregoing will occur,
except as may be reserved in the Interim  Balance Sheet.  Section 4.07(b) of the
Disclosure  Schedule  sets  forth a true and  correct  aging  as of the  Interim
Balance  Sheet Date of the  accounts  payable set forth on the  Interim  Balance
Sheet.

     4.08 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in Section 4.08 of the
Disclosure Schedule, Target has no Liabilities, except:

          (a) Liabilities pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Document;

          (b) those Liabilities set forth in the Target Financial Statements and
not heretofore paid or discharged;

          (c) Liabilities  arising in the ordinary course,  and not by reason of
any  Default,  under  any  Contract  specifically  disclosed  in the  Disclosure
Schedule  or not  required  to be so  disclosed  because  of the term or  amount
involved or otherwise; and

          (d)  Liabilities  incurred in the  ordinary  course  since the Interim
Balance  Sheet Date that are of a type that would  normally  appear on a balance
sheet of Target as of the date  hereof  and  which do not arise  from  breach of
contract, breach of warranty, tort or infringement.

     4.09  Existing  Conditions.  Except as  disclosed  in  Section  4.09 of the
Disclosure Schedule, since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, Target has not:

          (a) declared, set aside or paid any dividend or made or agreed to make
any other  distribution  or  payment in  respect  of its  equity  securities  or
redeemed,  purchased  or  otherwise  acquired  or agreed to redeem,  purchase or
acquire any of its equity securities;

          (b) discharged or satisfied any Encumbrance,  or paid any Liabilities,
other than in the ordinary  course,  or failed to pay or discharge  when due any

transfer any of its Assets except in the ordinary course;

          (d) incurred, issued, assumed or guaranteed any indebtedness for money

Contract,  to which it is a party  or by  which it is or any of its  Assets  are
bound, or canceled,  modified or waived any material debts or claims held by it,
other than in the ordinary course, or waived any right of material value,  other
than in the ordinary course;

          (f) suffered any material damage,  destruction or loss, whether or not
covered by insurance,  (i) adversely  affecting the Business or (ii) of any item
carried  on its  books of  account,  or  suffered  any  repeated,  recurring  or
prolonged shortage,  cessation or interruption of inventory shipments,  supplies
or utility services required to conduct its Business and operations;

          (g) suffered any Material Adverse Effect;

          (h) made any capital expenditures or capital additions or betterments,
except  such  as may  be  involved  in  the  ordinary  repair,  maintenance  and
replacement of its Assets;

          (i)  increased  the  salaries  or other  compensation  of, or made any
advance  (excluding  advances for ordinary and necessary  business  expenses) or
loan to,  any of its  employees  or  Holders,  or made any  increase  in, or any
addition to, other benefits to which any of its employees may be entitled;

          (j) made any  payment  to any  holder of  Target  Capital  Stock  with
respect to any indebtedness owed to any holder; or

applicable  Laws,  Court Orders,  Governmental  Permits,  or restrictions of any
Governmental  Body having  jurisdiction  over any portion of the Identified Real
Property  and  Target  has  obtained  all  approvals  of any  Governmental  Body

connection with the use of the Identified Real Property.

               (iv) There are no parties  other than Target in possession of any

Patents,  Trademarks,  inventions,  Copyrights,  internet  domain  names,  Trade
Secrets and any and all other  intellectual  property  used in, or  necessary to
operate, the Business as now conducted. Target has good legal title to, or has a
valid and enforceable license to use, all of the Intellectual Property.  Section
4.12 of the  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a complete and correct list of all
(i) registered  Patents,  Trademarks and Copyrights owned by the Target and (ii)

(the "Licenses"),  other than licenses with respect to "off-the-shelf" software,
each with a cost of less than $1,000. Except as set forth on Section 4.12 of the
Disclosure  Schedule,  (a) to the  Knowledge  of  Holders,  the  conduct  of the
business of Target as currently conducted,  including,  without limitation,  all
Intellectual  Property used by Target in the conduct of such business,  does not
conflict with or infringe upon any  proprietary  right of any third party in any
material  respect  and (b) there is no claim  pending  or, to the  Knowledge  of
Holders,  threatened  that (i) alleges any such conflict with or infringement of
any third  party's  proprietary  rights by  Target or (ii)  challenges  Target's
ownership or use of any  Intellectual  Property.  Except as set forth on Section
4.12 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,  Target is not under  any  obligation  to pay
royalties  or  other  payments  in  connection  with  any  Contract  to use  the
Intellectual Property and is not restricted from assigning its rights respecting
Intellectual Property.

          (b) Except as disclosed in Section  4.12 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,
all of the  issued  Patents  are  currently  in  compliance  with  formal  legal
requirements (including payment of filing, examination, and maintenance fees and
proofs  of  working  or  use),  to  the  Knowledge  of  Holders  are  valid  and
enforceable,  and are not  subject to any  maintenance  fees or taxes or actions
falling due within  ninety days after the Closing Date. No Patent has been or is
now  involved  in  any  interference,   reissue,  reexamination,  or  opposition
proceeding.  To the  Knowledge of Holders there are no  potentially  interfering
patents or patent  applications of any third party. To the Knowledge of Holders,
no Patent is infringed or has been challenged or threatened in any way.

          (c)  Each  License  is in full  force  and  effect  and is  valid  and
enforceable  in  accordance  with its terms.  Target,  and, to the  Knowledge of
Holders,  each other party to such License are in  compliance  with the terms of
such  License  and are not in  Default.  There are no  outstanding  and,  to the
Knowledge of Holders,  no  threatened  disputes,  disagreements  or requests for
renegotiation  with respect to any such License.  The Target does not currently,
and has not since  January 31, 1997 (date of Quality  Tube  license  agreement),
made or sold any product used or intended to be used in any  wellbore,  downhole
oil and gas production, completion or workover activities.

          (d) To the Knowledge of Holders none of the products  manufactured and
sold, nor any process or know-how  used, by the Company  infringes or is alleged
to infringe any patent or other proprietary right of any other Person.

with the review or audit of the  financial  statements  of Target by  Acquiror's
accountants,  if required,  the chief  executive or chief  financial  officer of
Target  shall  execute  any  documentation  reasonably  required  by  Acquiror's
accountants.

     6.02  Access to Books and  Records.  From and after the  Closing,  Acquiror
shall  provide  the Holders and their  agents  with  reasonable  access (for the
purpose of examining and copying),  during normal  business  hours, to the books
and records of (i) Target with  respect to periods or  occurrences  prior to the
Closing Date in connection with any matter whether or not relating to or arising
out of the Transaction Documents or the Transactions,  and (ii) Target and those
members of the Acquiror  Affiliated  Group that were included in the calculation
of Contingent Merger  Consideration  Revenue,  provided Holders and their agents
have signed a confidentiality  agreement and agreed to use such information only
in connection with the determination of Contingent Merger Consideration  Revenue
for any  year.  Acquiror  shall not for a period of seven  years  following  the
Closing  Date,  destroy,  alter,  or  otherwise  dispose  of (or permit any such
destruction,  alteration  or disposal of) any of the books and records of Target
for periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the
Holders such books and records or any portion  thereof which Acquiror may intend
to destroy, alter, or dispose of.

     6.03  Publicity.  No press release or public  announcement  related to this
Agreement  or the  Transactions  contemplated  herein  shall be  issued  or made
without the joint approval of Acquiror and the Holders'  Representative,  unless
required by law (in the  reasonable  opinion of counsel) in which case  Acquiror
and Holders' Representative shall have the right to review such press release or
announcement prior to publication.

     6.04  Reorganization  Status. None of the Parties shall take any actions or
fail to take an action after the  completion  of the Merger that could cause the
Merger to cease to qualify as a 368 Reorganization.  Each Party agrees to report
the Transaction as a tax-free reorganization for all relevant Tax purposes.

     6.05 Tax Return Preparation.

          (a) Acquiror shall not file any amended Tax Returns for Target for Tax
Returns  filed  prior to the date hereof  that could  reasonably  be expected to
result in an indemnification  claim by Acquiror under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Holders' Representative, which will not be withheld
if Acquiror delivers an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Holders'
Representative  that such amended return is required under applicable Law, or if
such amended Tax Return is to be filed as a result of a final  determination (as
defined in Section  1313 of the Code) of the issues  raised in the  original Tax
Return.

          (b)  Acquiror  shall  prepare all Tax  Returns  for Target  (including
related information returns,  such as IRS Form W-2 and other employee forms) for
periods  that end on or before or include  the  Closing  Date (each a "Final Tax
Return") in a manner  consistent  with the past Tax Returns  filed by the Target
(unless  Acquiror  determines  in good  faith  there is no  reasonable  basis to
continue  such  reporting).  No  election  shall  be  made  under  Reg.  Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D)  to ratably  allocate items of income and expense between
the Final Tax Return for the period  January 1, 2003 through the Effective  Time
and the period beginning the day after the Effective Time and ending on December
31,  2003  unless  the  Holders'  Representative  consents  in  writing  to such
election,  and such  consent  shall not be  withheld if the  election  could not
reasonably result in an indemnification  of an Acquiror  Indemnified Party under
this Agreement. Any items of income or expense that arise on the date of Closing
as a result of the  Merger or as a result of  including  Target in the  Acquiror
consolidated  tax return shall be deemed to arise on the next  business  day, as
provided in Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b),  and will not be deemed to occur prior to
the Closing.

          (c) The filing of any Final Tax  Return  shall be subject to the prior
review of the Holders' Representative. No later than 45 days prior to the filing
due date  (including  extensions) of a Final Tax Return,  Acquiror shall provide
Holders'  Representative  with a copy of the draft Final Tax Return. If Holder's
Representative  shall have delivered to Acquiror  within twenty business days of
Holders'  Representative's receipt of such draft Final Tax Return written notice
of its disagreement with such draft Final Tax Return, specifying with reasonable
particularity all items of disagreement  with such draft,  Acquiror and Holders'
Representative  shall resolve any such items of disagreement prior to the filing
of such Final Tax Return.

     6.06.....Tax  Covenants.  Following  the Merger,  the historic  business of
Target will be  continued  by, or a  significant  portion of  Target's  historic
business assets will be used in a business of: (i) the Acquiring Parties; (ii) a
corporation  within  Acquiror's  qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation  Section  1.368-1(d)(4)(ii));  or (iii) a  partnership  described  in
Treasury  Regulation Section  1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).  For a period of not less than
two years  following the Effective  Time,  neither the Surviving  Entity nor any
partner of the Surviving  Entity will issue  additional  ownership  interests in
their  respective  entities  that would  result in  Acquiror  losing  control of
Acquisition Sub within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

     8.04 Limitations.

          (a) No Holder  will have any  liability  with  respect to the  matters
described  in Section 8.01 or 8.02(a) or (b) except to the extent that the total
of all Liabilities with respect to such matters exceeds $100,000,  provided that
this limitation  shall not apply to any breach of covenant to be performed after
Closing  or to any breach of the  representations  and  warranties  set forth in
Section 4.02 or Section 4.03(b) and further  provided that this limitation shall
not apply to any breach of Section 4.12(c) solely as such section applies to the
License  Agreement  dated  January 31, 1997  between  Quality  Tubing,  Inc. and
Southwestern  Pipe,  Inc.  as  assigned  by  Southwestern  Pipe,  Inc. to SeaCat
Corporation.  In no event will any Holder have any liability with respect to the
matters  described  in Section  8.01 for any amounts in excess of the  Aggregate
Merger  Consideration  received  by such  Holder as set forth on Exhibit C. With
respect to the matters described in Section 8.02 the following  limitations will

warranties set forth in Section 4.02 or Section  4.03(b),  the Holders'  maximum
aggregate  liability shall be equal to the Aggregate Merger  Consideration,  and
(ii) with respect to all other matters  described in Section 8.02(a) or (b), the
Holders'  maximum  aggregate  liability  shall be  $10,000,000.  Notwithstanding
anything in this  Agreement to the  contrary,  Lewis or FLP shall,  in no event,
have  any  liability   under  this  Article  8  or  otherwise  with  respect  to

breach of the  representations  and warranties set forth in Sections 4.08, 4.09,
4.11,   4.18,   4.20  or  4.24   (but   solely   as  such   Sections   apply  to
environmental-related matters) (collectively, the "Environmental Liability"), in
excess  of  $1,500,000  ("Environmental  Cap")  provided  that,  after  Holders'
obligations  for  Environmental  Liability have reached  $1,000,000 then Holders
shall be liable for only 50% of any remaining  Environmental Liability up to the
remaining Environmental Cap.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this  Agreement,  the Charter

contrary, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to reimburse,
contribute,  indemnify  or hold  harmless  any  Holder in  respect of any of the
liabilities  or obligations of the Holders under this Article 8. No Holder shall

recovery  in  respect of such  Holder's  indemnification  obligation  under this

          (d) The amount of any Losses otherwise payable to an Indemnified Party

such  Indemnified  Party  (giving  effect  to  deductibles  or self  insured  or
co-insurance  payments made) as compensation  for the damage or Losses caused by
the act, or omission, fact or circumstance giving rise to the Losses.

     8.05 Survival.  The  representations and warranties of the Parties given or
made in this  Agreement  or in any  certificate  or other  writing  furnished in
connection  herewith  shall survive until the second  anniversary of the Closing
Date and shall thereafter terminate and be of no further force or effect, except
that (a) solely to the  extent  the  representations  and  warranties  relate to
environmental-related matters, including but not limited to Sections 4.08, 4.09,
4.11,  4.18,  4.20 and 4.24 (as  such  Sections  apply to  environmental-related
matters),  such  representations  and warranties shall survive the Closing until
one year after the Closing Date,  (b) the  representations  and  warranties  set
forth in Section  4.02 and 4.03(b)  shall  survive the Closing  until the fourth
anniversary  of the Closing Date, and (c) any  representation  or warranty as to
which a claim shall have been asserted during the survival period shall continue
in effect with  respect to such claim  until such claim shall have been  finally
resolved or settled.

     8.06  Holders  Indemnification   Procedures.  All  claims  or  demands  for
indemnification under this Article 8 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

          (a) In the event  that any claim or demand  for which an  indemnifying
party   ("Indemnifying   Party")  would  be  liable  to  an  indemnified   party
("Indemnified  Party")  hereunder is asserted against an Indemnified  Party by a
third party, the Indemnified  Party shall within 30 days notify the Indemnifying
Party of such claim or demand (the  "Claim  Notice"),  specifying  the nature of
such  claim or demand  and the  amount or the  estimated  amount  thereof to the
extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such claim or demand); provided, however, that any delay or failure to notify
the  Indemnifying  Party within such time period shall relieve the  Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent it is prejudiced by reason
of such delay or  failure.  The  Indemnifying  Party shall have 30 days from the
receipt of the Claim  Notice (the  "Notice  Period")  to notify the  Indemnified
Party  (i)  whether  or  not  the  Indemnifying   Party  disputes  the  relevant
Indemnifying  Party's  liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect
to such claim or demand and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party does not dispute such
Liability,  whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires,  at the sole cost and
expense of such  Indemnifying  Party,  to defend  against  such claim or demand,
provided that the  Indemnified  Party is hereby  authorized  (but not obligated)
prior to and  during  the  Notice  Period  to file any  motion,  answer or other
pleading and to take such action which the  Indemnified  Party shall  reasonably
deem necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified  Party's interests.  In
the event that the Indemnifying  Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that, based on the facts then known to it, the Indemnifying  Party
does not dispute such Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify hereunder and
desires to defend  the  Indemnified  Party  against  such  claim or demand,  the
Indemnifying  Party  shall  have the right to defend  (with  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory  to the  Indemnified  Party) by appropriate  proceedings;  provided
that, unless the Indemnified Party otherwise agrees in writing, the Indemnifying
Party may not settle any matter  (in whole or in part)  unless  such  settlement
includes a complete and unconditional  release of the Indemnified  Party. If the
Indemnified  Party desires to participate in, but not control,  any such defense
or settlement the Indemnified  Party may do so at its sole cost and expense.  If
the Indemnifying  Party elects not to defend the Indemnified  Party against such
claim or demand,  whether by not giving the  Indemnified  Party timely notice as
provided above or otherwise,  then the  Indemnified  Party,  without waiving any
rights against such  Indemnifying  Party,  may settle or defend against any such
claim in the  Indemnified  Party's  sole  discretion  and,  if it is  ultimately
determined  that the  Indemnifying  Party is  responsible  therefor  under  this
Article 8, then the  Indemnified  Party shall be  entitled  to recover  from the
relevant  Indemnifying  Party the amount of any  settlement  or judgment and all
indemnifiable  costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party with respect thereto,
including  interest  from the date such costs and expenses  were incurred at the
fluctuating rate per annum equal to two percentage points in excess of the prime
rate  published  from  time to  time  in the of The  Wall  Street  Journal  (the
"Applicable Rate") subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 8.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if an Indemnified Party determines
in good  faith  that there is a  reasonable  probability  that any such claim or
demand  may  adversely  affect it or its  affiliates  other  than as a result of
monetary  damages for which it would be entitled to  indemnification  under this
Agreement,  the  Indemnified  Party may,  by notice to the  Indemnifying  Party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim or demand,
provided the cost of defending  such claim shall be the sole  responsibility  of
the Indemnified  Party. In such event,  Indemnifying  Party will not be bound by
any  determination  of a proceeding so defended or any  compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

          (c) In the event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying  Party  hereunder  which does not  involve a claim or demand  being
asserted  against or sought to be collected by a third  party,  the  Indemnified
Party  shall  with  reasonable  promptness,  and  in  any  event  prior  to  the
termination pursuant to Section 8.05 of any representation and warranty on which
any such claim is based,  send a Claim  Notice with respect to such claim to the
Indemnifying  Party.  In the case of any claim against a Holder,  a copy of such
Claim  Notice  shall  also  be  sent  to  the  Holders'  Representative.  If the
Indemnifying  Party  does not  notify the  Indemnified  Party  within the Notice
Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim
shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

          (d) Nothing  herein shall be deemed to prevent the  Indemnified  Party
from making a claim  hereunder  for  potential or  contingent  claims or demands
provided the Claim Notice sets forth the specific  basis for any such  potential
or contingent  claim or demand to the extent then  feasible and the  Indemnified
Party has  reasonable  good faith belief that such a claim will be made. At such
time when the  Indemnified  Party  shall have a good faith  belief that any such
potential or contingent claim or demand will not be made, the Indemnified  Party
shall withdraw its Claim Notice and claim, and all such Claim Notices and claims
for potential or contingent  claims or demands shall be deemed  withdrawn on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date. The Indemnified  Party's failure to give
reasonably prompt notice to the Indemnifying  Parties of any actual,  threatened
or possible  claim or demand  which may give rise to a right of  indemnification
hereunder shall not relieve the Indemnifying  Parties of any Liability which the
Indemnifying  Parties may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the
failure to give such notice prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

     8.07 Exceptions to Limitations.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict in any manner any rights or remedies that any Party has, or might have,
at law, in equity or otherwise,  against any other Party,  based on  intentional
misrepresentation, or other fraud.

     8.08 Effect of  Investigation  or  Knowledge.  Any claim by an  Indemnified
Party for  indemnification  shall not be adversely affected by any investigation
by or opportunity to investigate afforded to Acquiring Parties. Each Party shall
be deemed to be relying on the representations and warranties of the other Party
set forth herein  regardless of any  investigation  or audit conducted before or
after  the  Closing  Date  or  the  decision  of any  Party  to  consummate  the
Transactions contemplated hereby.

     8.09  Payment  of  Indemnification  Obligations.  In  the  event  that  any
Indemnifying  Party is required to make any payment  under this  Article 8, such
amount shall be paid  promptly to the  Indemnified  Party.  If there should be a
dispute as to such amount,  the portion,  if any, of the obligation as shall not
be subject to dispute shall be paid promptly.  The difference,  if any,  between
the amount of the  obligation  ultimately  determined as properly  payable under
this Article 8 and the portion, if any,  theretofore paid shall bear interest at
the Applicable  Rate for the period from the date the amount was demanded by the
Indemnified Party until payment in full, payable on demand.

     8.10 Set Off.  Acquiror may set off any and all amounts  which the Acquiror
in good faith  claims to be  entitled to from a Holder  under  Article 8 against
amounts otherwise payable by Acquiror to such Holder under this Agreement or the
Note,  if not  timely  paid by such  Holder;  provided,  that in the event it is
determined  that Acquiror  offset amounts in excess of the Losses to which it is
entitled  under this Section 8,  Acquiror  shall repay the amount of such excess
offsets to  Holders'  Representative  along with  interest at the rate per annum
equal to the prime rate of JPMorgan  Chase on the date the offset  occurs  which
interest shall accrue from the date of offset of such excess amounts to the date
repaid by the Acquiror provided,  that such interest shall be due only if and to
the extent the amounts against which such set off occurs are not already bearing
interest.  Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of set
off will  constitute an election of remedies or limit  Acquiror in any manner in
the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

     8.11  Exclusive  Remedy.  The rights and remedies of the Parties under this
Article 8 are the sole and  exclusive  rights and  remedies of such Parties with
respect to any matters arising out of this Agreement or the  Transactions  other
than with respect to claims for intentional misrepresentation or other fraud and
other than with  respect to claims  under the Note or the Credit  Documents  (as
defined  in the  Note)  and the  Employment  Agreement  or Lewis  Noncompetition
Agreement. FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES,
RELEASES  AND  DISCHARGES  ALL RIGHTS TO, AND  COVENANTS  NOT TO SUE FOR, AND NO
PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY  OBLIGATION  FOR,  ANY DAMAGES,  WHETHER  UNDER ANY STATUTE
(INCLUDING WITHOUT  LIMITATION ANY ENVIRONMENTAL  LAWS), IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT,
AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ARTICLE 8.

                                    ARTICLE 9

the event of the death,  disability or resignation  of such Person,  a successor
may be  appointed by the Holders.  The  Holders'  Representative  shall have the
power to take any and all actions which the Holders' Representative believes are
necessary or appropriate or in the best interests of the Holders, as fully as if
each such Holder was acting on its,  his or her own behalf  with  respect to all
claims for  indemnification  under this  Agreement  and to take any action or no
action  in  connection  therewith  as  the  Holders'   Representative  may  deem
appropriate as effectively  as the Holders could act  themselves,  including the
settlement or compromise  of any dispute or  controversy.  In no event shall the
Holders'  Representative be required to expend his own funds to defend any claim

such defense,  contribution by the Holders of funds necessary to pay the cost of
any such defense.  The authority  granted hereunder is deemed to be coupled with

Representative as being the act or omission of the Holders, without the need for

expense as a result of any action taken in good faith  hereunder,  including any
legal fees and expenses.

     9.11  Disclosure  Schedule.  The  Disclosure  Schedule shall be arranged in
numbered  sections  corresponding  to  the  Sections  and  subsections  of  this
Agreement  to which they relate.  Nothing in the  Disclosure  Schedule  shall be
deemed to disclose an  exception  to a  representation  or warranty  made herein
unless such exception is identified  specifically  in the applicable  section of
the Disclosure  Schedule,  except where the context of such disclosure  makes it
reasonably  apparent that such  disclosure is also being  disclosed for purposes
relating to the representation or warranty  referenced on another section of the
Disclosure Schedule.

     9.12 Conflict  Waiver.  Each of Target and Acquiror (i)  acknowledges  that
Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP ("LLS") had, prior to the Effective  Time,  represented
Target as its  general  legal  counsel,  (ii)  hereby  waives  any  conflict  or
potential  conflict arising out of its representation of the Holders (as a group
or any such  Holders  individually)  with respect to or in  connection  with the
transactions  contemplated by the Agreement, and (iii) consents to the retention
of LLS by the Holders as legal  counsel in  connection  with any and all matters
referred  to herein or in  connection  with any  disputes  arising  out to terms
hereof or the matters referred to herein.

     9.13 Specific Performance;  Attorneys' Fees. The Parties hereby acknowledge
that  irreparable  damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this  Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific terms or
were  otherwise  breached.  Each of the  Parties  shall be  entitled  to seek an
injunction or injunctions  to prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any court having  jurisdiction.
In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce  this  Agreement or the rights
of any of the Parties hereunder  (including any claim for indemnification  under
Article  8), the  prevailing  Party in such  action or suit shall be entitled to
receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys' fees and all other  reasonable costs
and  expenses  incurred  in such  action or suit,  if in such action or suit the
principal  claim or  defense of the  non-prevailing  Party is held to be without
merit because it was not  reasonably  supported by Laws or material and relevant
facts.
