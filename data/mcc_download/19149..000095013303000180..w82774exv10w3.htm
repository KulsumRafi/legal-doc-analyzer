<P><FONT size="2">Date of Note: October&nbsp;7, 2002
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">PROMISE TO PAY. Stationers, Inc. (&#147;Borrower&#148;) promises to pay to FIRST SENTRY
BANK (&#147;Lender&#148;), order, In lawful money of the United States of America, the
principal amount of One Million &#038; 00/t00 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or so much as
may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal
balance of each advance. Interest shall be calculated from the date of each
advance until repayment of each advance.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan in one payment of all outstanding
principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on April&nbsp;7, 2004. In addition,
Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due
as of each payment date, beginning November&nbsp;7, 2002, with all subsequent
interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that. Unless
otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first
to any unpaid collection costs and any late charges, then to any unpaid
interest, and any remaining amount to principal. The annual interest rate for
this Note is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the
annual interest rate over a year of 360&nbsp;days, multiplied by the outstanding
principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal
balance is outstanding. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender&#146;s address shown
above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this Note is subject to change
from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime
Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal (the &#147;Index&#148;). The Index is not
necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans. If the Index
becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a
substitute index after notice to Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the
current Index rate upon Borrower&#146;s request. The interest rate change will not
occur more often than each day. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans
based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 4.750% per annum. The
interest rate to be applied to the unpaid principal balance of this Note will
be at a rate equal to the Index, resulting in an initial rate of 4.750% per
annum. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this Note be
more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P><FONT size="2">PREPAYMENT. Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount
owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by
Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower&#146;s obligation to continue to
make payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather, early payments will reduce
the principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked
&#147;paid in full&#148;, &#147;without recourse&#148;, or similar language. If Borrower sends such
a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender&#146;s rights under
this Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to
Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any
check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes
&#147;payment in full&#148; of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions
or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or
delivered to: FIRST SENTRY BANK, P. O. BOX 2107 HUNTINGTON, WV 25721.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10&nbsp;days or more late, Borrower will be charged
$25.00.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, including failure to pay upon final
maturity, the total sum due under this Note will bear interest from the date of
acceleration or maturity at the variable interest rate on this Note. The
interest rate will not exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (&#147;Event of
Default&#148;) under this Note:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under this Note.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Other Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term,
obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or in any of the
related documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation,
covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and
Borrower.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished
to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower&#146;s behalf under this Note or the related
documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the
time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Insolvency. The dissolution or termination of Borrower&#146;s existence as a going
business, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any
part of Borrower&#146;s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any
type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any
bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture
proceedings, whether by Judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any
other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against
any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment of any of
Borrower&#146;s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this
Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower
as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the
creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice
of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a
surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined
by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the
dispute.

<P><FONT size="2">Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to
any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of any of the
indebtedness or any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party dies or
becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability
under, any guaranty of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note. In the event of
a death, Lender, at its option, may, but shall not be required to, permit the
guarantor&#146;s estate to assume unconditionally the obligations arising under the
guaranty in a manner satisfactory to Lender, and, in doing so, cure any Event
of Default.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Change In Ownership. Any change in ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the common stock of Borrower.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Borrower&#146;s financial
condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of this
Note is impaired.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Cure Provisions. If any default, other than a default in payment is curable and
if Borrower has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of
this Note within the preceding twelve (12)&nbsp;months, it may be cured (and no
event of default will have occurred) if Borrower, after receiving written
notice from Lender demanding cure of such default: (1)&nbsp;cures the default within
ten (10)&nbsp;days; or (2)&nbsp;if the cure requires more than ten (10)&nbsp;days, immediately
initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender&#146;s sole discretion to be sufficient
to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and
necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably
practical.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">LENDER&#146;S RIGHTS. Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal
balance on this Note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and then
Borrower will pay that amount.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">ATTORNEYS&#146; FEES; EXPENSES. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help collect
this Note if Borrower does not pay. Borrower will pay Lender that amount. This
includes, subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees
and Lender&#146;s legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including
attorneys&#146; fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to
modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. If not
prohibited by applicable law, Borrower also will pay any court costs, in
addition to all other sums provided by law.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">GOVERNING LAW. This Note will be governed by, construed and enforced in
accordance with federal law and the laws of the State of West Virginia. This
Note has been accepted by Lender in the State of West Virginia.
</FONT>

to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of CABELL County, State of West
Virginia.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">RIGHT OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a
right of setoff in all Borrower&#146;s accounts with Lender (whether checking,
savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds
jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future.
However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts
for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the
debt against any and all such accounts.
