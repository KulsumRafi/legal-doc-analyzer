                            PURCHASE/SUPPLY AGREEMENT

         THIS TERMINATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of December 6, 2002, by and between INTRABIOTICS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,
("IntraBiotics"), a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business

"Parties".

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, IntraBiotics and Polypeptide entered into a Development Supply
Agreement, dated January 3, 1997 (the "Development Agreement"), pursuant to
which Polypeptide agreed to develop, manufacture and supply IntraBiotics with
quantities of IntraBiotics' proprietary peptide, IB-367 ("Product") in bulk
form, and a Purchase/Supply Agreement, dated January 3, 1997 (the "Purchase
Agreement"), pursuant to which Polypeptide agreed to manufacture and supply to
IntraBiotics commercial quantities of Product in bulk form;

         WHEREAS, in the course of such relationship, IntraBiotics ordered five
lots of Product (lots H, I, J, K and L) from Polypeptide by letter dated
September 5, 2000 (the "September 2000 Order"), of which lots H and I are being
manufactured in sublots as follows: H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, I-1, I-2 and I-3;

         WHEREAS, Polypeptide has recently completed manufacture of Product lots
H1-H4, expects to complete manufacture of Product lots I1-3 in the near future,
and, at IntraBiotics' request, has ceased manufacturing activities with respect
to Product lots J, K and L ordered by IntraBiotics, which lots are in various
states of partial manufacture;

         WHEREAS, IntraBiotics and Polypeptide now desire to wind up their
business relationship with respect to Product, cancel the September 2000 Order,
extinguish the Standby Letters of Credit Nos. SVB01IS3761 and SVB01IS3762
securing the September 2000 Order, and provide for delivery and storage of the
completed lots and the fragments and intermediates of the remaining lots until
such time as IntraBiotics is ready to receive such completed lots, fragments and
intermediates; and

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and promises set forth
herein, and for other valuable consideration, the Parties agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         Swift Code: dabadkkk
         Account No: [Account Number]

2.       DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE OF PRODUCT

         2.1      DELIVERY OF PRODUCT. Polypeptide shall deliver each sublot of
Product in accordance with the schedule set forth on Exhibit B, by shipping to
IntraBiotics a two (2) gram sample of such Product, a Certificate of Analysis
for such Product, a statement of GMP compliance, and the following
documentation: (i) copies of the executed batch records for steps 2398, 2403 and
3107, (ii) translated copies of all documentation concerning any manufacturing
process deviations and (iii) the synthesis tree for the corresponding sample of
Product. Such shipment shall be made FCA (Incoterms 2000) Copenhagen. Not later
than December 15, 2002, Polypeptide shall deliver (a) a written inventory of
each Product fragment and intermediate in Polypeptide's custody identifying each
such fragment and intermediate by part number and specifying the quantity
thereof; and (b) copies of the QC release testing and QA disposition
documentation for fragments 2396, 2394, 2392, 2390 and 2386 and intermediates
2401 and 2399. IntraBiotics may examine all original documentation with respect
to such Product fragments and intermediates at Polypeptide's facility, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours.

         2.2      TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE/REJECTION.

                  (a)      SAMPLES. Polypeptide shall test sublots I-1 through
I-3 for conformance to the specifications as defined in Polypeptide document
3107-02. IntraBiotics shall test all samples delivered pursuant to Section 2.1
for conformity to the specifications as defined in IntraBiotics document
S-2000.3 (the "Specifications"), a copy of which has been delivered to
Polypeptide. IntraBiotics may reject any sample delivery which does not conform
with the

                                       2.

<PAGE>

Specifications or with the documentation referred to in Section 2.1. Any such
notice of rejection shall be given in writing within forty-five (45) days after
delivery of such sample and documentation (the "Acceptance Period"), and shall
specify the reasons for such rejection, including a report of analysis or cGMP
deviation of the allegedly non-conforming Product. If no such notice of
rejection is received by Polypeptide within the Acceptance Period, IntraBiotics
shall be deemed to have accepted the relevant Product sublot. Once IntraBiotics
accepts a Product sublot, IntraBiotics shall have no recourse against
Polypeptide if the Product is subsequently deemed unsuitable for use for any
reason, except as provided in Section 4.4 below.

                  (b)      POST-REJECTION PROCEDURE. If notice of rejection is
given, IntraBiotics shall cooperate with Polypeptide in determining whether
rejection is necessary or justified. Polypeptide will evaluate process issues
and other reasons for such non-compliance. Polypeptide shall notify IntraBiotics
as promptly as reasonably possible whether it accepts IntraBiotics' basis for
any rejection. If Polypeptide disagrees with IntraBiotics' determination that
certain Product does not meet the Specifications or the documentation referred
to in Section 2.1, such Product shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable
third party laboratory or consultant (the "Laboratory/Consultant"). Such
Laboratory/Consultant shall determine whether such Product meets the
Specifications and such documentation and the parties agree that such
Laboratory's/Consultant's determination shall be final and determinative. The
party against whom the Laboratory/Consultant rules shall bear all costs of the
Laboratory/Consultant testing/consultation. If the Laboratory/Consultant rules
that the Product meets Specifications and such documentation, IntraBiotics shall
pay the amount due under Section 1.1 (b) for such sublot. If the
Laboratory/Consultant rules that the sublot does not meet Specifications or such
documentation, IntraBiotics shall not be obligated to make any further payment
under Section 1.1 above, subject to the following sentence. In such event,
Polypeptide may reprocess the material and resubmit it to IntraBiotics for
approval, and such resubmitted material shall again be subject to the
approval/rejection procedure and schedule set forth in this Section 2.2.

         2.3      PRODUCT RELEASE. Upon receipt of written notice from
IntraBiotics that a delivery of Product has been accepted, or upon expiration of
the Acceptance Period without notice from IntraBiotics, Polypeptide shall
release the relevant Product sublot to the Storage Site (as defined in Section
4.1), and IntraBiotics shall make any payment due pursuant to Section 1.1. The
quantities of Product set forth in Exhibit B for each sublot represent
Polypeptide's best estimates of the allocation of Product among sublots.
IntraBiotics acknowledges that actual release quantities may vary among sublots;
however, Polypeptide shall be obligated to release to storage the total quantity
of Product for Lot I set forth in Exhibit B. Upon delivery to IntraBiotics of
the documentation described in Section 2.1 relating to fragments and
intermediates, Polypeptide shall release the fragments and intermediates to the
Storage Site.

3.       OTHER DELIVERABLES AND DOCUMENT RETENTION.

         3.1      OTHER DELIVERABLES. Polypeptide shall deliver to IntraBiotics
the items specified on Exhibit C in accordance with the schedule set forth
thereon.

         3.2      DOCUMENT RETENTION. Polypeptide shall retain the original
documents identified on Exhibit D for a period of not less than 5 years from the
Effective Date, and shall not destroy any such records at any time without
thirty (30) days written notice to IntraBiotics.

4.       STORAGE OF PRODUCT.

         4.1      STORAGE. Polypeptide shall store Product lots H and I, and the
fragments and intermediates of lots J, K and L, in accordance with the storage
conditions specified in Section 4.4 below, at Polypeptide's facility at
Hillerod, Denmark (the "Storage Site"). Alternatively, Polypeptide may store
such Product in accordance with the storage conditions specified in Section 4.4
below, at Polypeptide's facility in Malmo, Sweden or such other facility as
Polypeptide may propose, provided that Polypeptide shall so notify IntraBiotics
in writing at least 30 days prior to moving the Product, and shall include in
such notice the information specified in Exhibit E. IntraBiotics may object to
such relocation of the Product, in writing, not later than 10 days prior to the
proposed moving date. In such event, the Parties shall confer in good faith as
to the reasons for the proposed relocation and IntraBiotic's objections, and
shall discuss appropriate mechanisms to address both Parties' objectives and
concerns, and Polypeptide shall not move the Product until such dispute is
resolved. Storage of each Product sublot shall commence upon IntraBiotics'
acceptance of such sublot pursuant to Article 2. Storage of the fragments and
intermediates of Product lots J, K and L shall commence upon Polypeptide's
release of such fragments and intermediates pursuant to Article 2. Title and
risk of loss for each sublot, fragment and intermediate of Product that is
stored by Polypeptide shall transfer from Polypeptide to IntraBiotics
immediately upon the commencement of the applicable Storage Period (as defined
in Section 4.3). IntraBiotics shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining
appropriate insurance for such stored Product, and Polypeptide shall cooperate
with IntraBiotics' attempts to acquire such insurance.

         4.2      STORAGE FEE. Polypeptide shall store the Product for the
duration of the Storage Period (as defined in Section 4.3) at a total cost to
IntraBiotics of $250,000, payable at a rate of $12,500 per calendar quarter of
the Storage Period. The initial Storage Fee payment shall be due concurrent with
the execution of this Agreement, and shall be prorated based on the date of such
execution. Thereafter Polypeptide shall submit an invoice to IntraBiotics for
the quarterly Storage Fee payments on the first day of each subsequent calendar
quarter of the Storage Period. IntraBiotics' payment thereon shall be due not
later than 30 days after receipt of such invoice, and shall be paid in
accordance with Section 1.2.

         4.3      TERM OF STORAGE. Polypeptide shall store the Product for up to
five years from the date the first sublot of Product commences storage (the
"Storage Period"). If IntraBiotics wishes to terminate the storage arrangements
prior to the expiration of the Storage Period, it shall notify Polypeptide in
writing at least 30 days prior to the date such termination is to be effective
(the "Storage Termination Notice"), and shall provide written instructions as to
the disposition of the stored and any unreleased Product. Polypeptide shall ship
all such Product FCA (Incoterms 2000) Copenhagen to the location specified by
IntraBiotics, not later than the effective date of termination. Any unpaid
balance on the Storage Fee shall accelerate on the effective date of such
termination, and IntraBiotics shall pay to Polypeptide the balance due on the
Storage Fee not later than 10 business days after receipt of the entire quantity
of stored and unreleased (if any) Product lots, fragments and intermediates.

         4.4      CONDITIONS OF STORAGE. Polypeptide will store lots H1, H2, H3,
H4, I1, I2, and I3 at a temperature of -20 degrees Centigrade, plus or minus 5

Polypeptide will not be responsible for any degradation of the Product provided
that the Product is stored at -20 degrees Centigrade, plus or minus 5 degrees
Centigrade, and less than 8 degrees Centigrade, respectively, at all times. In
any event, Polypeptide shall not be responsible for any damage to the Product
that occurs by reason of force majeure. As used in this Section 4.4, "qualified
chambers" shall mean chambers meeting ICH guidelines.

         4.5      MONITORING OF STORED PRODUCT. At IntraBiotics request, the
temperature and maintenance logs of the storage chambers will be forwarded to
IntraBiotics for review. The power supply to the chambers will have generator
