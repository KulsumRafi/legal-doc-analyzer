<p align="center"><b><i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Manufacturing of Surfaxin<sup>&reg;</sup> for ARDS Trial to Recommence in March 2003<br />
</font></i></b></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Doylestown, PA &mdash; February 20, 2003 &mdash; Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (Nasdaq: DSCO), a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company leveraging its technology in humanized lung surfactants to develop novel respiratory
therapies today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2002.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company reported a net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.17 per share, on approximately 30.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a net loss of $4.2 million, or $0.17
per share, on approximately 25.0 million weighted average shares outstanding for the same period in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company reported a net loss of $17.4 million, or $0.64 per share, on approximately 27.4 million weighted average shares
outstanding, compared to a net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.51 per share, on approximately 22.0 million weighted average shares outstanding at year end 2001.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The increase in the net loss primarily reflects clinical trial costs incurred for the Company&rsquo;s lead product, Surfaxin (which is currently in three Phase 3 trials and one Phase 2 trial for critical care patients with
life threatening respiratory disorders), as well as activities related to the development of aerosolized formulations of the Company&rsquo;s humanized lung surfactant to potentially treat a variety of respiratory conditions.&nbsp; The results also include charges of
$193,000 and $1,450,000 (for the quarter ended and twelve months ended December 31, 2002, respectively) for pre-launch commercialization activities for Surfaxin conducted for which funding is provided by a secured, revolving credit facility pursuant to a
collaboration arrangement with Quintiles Transnational Corp. (&ldquo;Quintiles&rdquo;).&nbsp; Included in the year ended December 31, 2002, is a non-cash compensation charge of $402,000 primarily related to the grant of stock options to non-employee members of the
Board of Directors under the Automatic Option Grant program of the Company&rsquo;s Stock Option Plan and modifications to certain options held by three departing directors in connection with a reconfiguration of the Board. Additionally, included in the fourth quarter
and year ended December 31, 2002, are charges of approximately $428,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, for reductions in prepaid expense balances primarily associated with research and development activities.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As of December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and investments of approximately $19.2 million.&nbsp; The Company has a secured revolving credit facility of $8.5 million to $10.0 million with Quintiles. The Company may use this
credit facility for general working capital purposes but is obligated to use a majority of the funds borrowed under this facility for pre-launch marketing of Surfaxin. As of December 31, 2002, $5.7 million was available for borrowing and $1.45 was outstanding under
the credit facility.&nbsp; In December 2002, the Company entered into a lease financing arrangement with the Life Science and Technology Finance Division of General Electric Capital Corporation that provides, subject to certain conditions, for up to $1.0 million in
financing for capital purchases. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has used approximately $285,000 of this financing arrangement. Our currently available financial resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs into the second quarter of 2004.</font></p>

</font></b>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2002 is primarily due to approximately 822,000 common shares issued in connection with the March 2002 expansion of the strategic alliance with Laboratorios
del Dr. Esteve (&ldquo;Esteve&rdquo;) and approximately 6.4 million common shares issued to selected institutional and accredited investors in a private offering in November 2002. As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, there were approximately 32,857,000 and
25,546,000 common shares issued and outstanding, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Robert J. Capetola, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Discovery, commented &ldquo;This upcoming year presents a number of critical milestones for Discovery. The past year has prepared us for these
opportunities.&nbsp; First, we put in place a high quality development infrastructure executing our four ongoing late-stage clinical trials of Surfaxin, with Phase 3 results in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants and Phase 2 results in acute
respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) expected during 2003.&nbsp; The Company now has in place the sales and marketing capability to bring Surfaxin to the critical care markets in the United States, Europe and Latin America through our strategic relationships with
Quintiles and Esteve. We announced very encouraging results, albeit in a small patient population, from Part A of our Phase 2 clinical trial of Surfaxin for ARDS, a life-threatening disorder for which there are currently no approved therapies anywhere in the world.
Based on ever-increasing scientific evidence supporting the potential pipeline of opportunities for surfactant therapy for respiratory diseases, we launched our aerosol operations in Redwood City, California to develop aerosol formulations of our humanized lung
surfactant and have already entered into two promising collaborations.&nbsp; Lastly, we closed a successful private financing with a group of well-recognized and sophisticated life sciences investors.&rdquo;</font></p>

anticipated recommencing manufacture in February 2003. On February 18, 2003, Akorn advised the Company that this sterile production room has returned to full operational status. Surfaxin manufacturing for ARDS is expected to recommence in March 2003. The trial is
ongoing and is expected to return to full operational status in April 2003. The Company now anticipates completing Part B of its Phase 2 ARDS trial in the third quarter of 2003.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The results from our pivotal, landmark multinational Phase 3 trial for Surfaxin for Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants are anticipated to be available in October 2003, approximately four months later than
originally communicated, with the New Drug Application to be filed with the FDA shortly thereafter. Several additional sites were due to be added to our existing qualified clinical trial site base beginning in late-January through March 2003. Activating these
additional sites would have positioned us to complete the landmark trial in May 2003. However, management has recently made the decision not to include these sites into its existing base of qualified clinical sites. This decision was reached after a thorough
evaluation and is consistent with our stringent clinical site quality processes and criteria designed to provide the highest probability of success in this pivotal trial to allow the introduction of the first humanized lung surfactant to market.</font></p>
