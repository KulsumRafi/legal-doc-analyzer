                                                                       EXHIBIT C

         e.       CONSTRUCTION. If for any reason a court of competent
jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be
unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum
extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the Parties, and the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Failure by either
party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of
future enforcement of that or any other provision.

         f.       SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement, and any rights or
obligations hereunder shall not be transferred or assigned by either party
without the consent of the other party, in the exercise of its sole discretion;
provided, however, that both parties may assign this Agreement to (a) their
respective Affiliates or (b) as part of a merger, sale of substantially all
assets or other corporate reorganization; provided, however, in the event of a
transfer or assignment by, or change in ownership or control of, a party hereto
(the "TRANSFERRING PARTY"), such that the transferee, assignee or newly
controlling party is a competitor of the other party hereto, such other party
may terminate this agreement upon the provision of written notice to the
Transferring Party, unless the Transferring Party has obtained the prior written
consent of the other party hereto prior to the effective date of such transfer,
assignment or change of control. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
be binding upon the respective successors and permitted assigns of the Parties.

         g.       ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or communications. It shall
not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and signed on behalf of Burdick and Spacelabs by their respective
duly authorized representatives. No waiver of any breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent
breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be
effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of
the waiving party.

         h.       SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, it is to
that extent to be deemed omitted. The remainder of the Agreement shall be valid
and enforceable to the maximum extent possible.

         i.       AUTHORITY. The parties each represent and warrant that each
has duly authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
and that the undersigned have been duly authorized to execute this Agreement on
behalf of their respective companies.
