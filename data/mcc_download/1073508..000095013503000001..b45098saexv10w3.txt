         Section  2. Loans and Fee.

         (a)      Contemporaneously herewith, the Reservoir Lenders will lend to
the Borrower an additional $2,000,000 as a Term Loan (the "Additional Reservoir
Lendings"), which Additional Reservoir Lendings shall be evidenced by two
promissory notes in or substantially in the form required under the Loan
Agreement. The borrowings contemplated by this Amendment shall not constitute
additional warranties or representations regarding the Obligors or any fact or
circumstance whatsoever, except that the warranties and representations made in
Sections 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 of the Loan Agreement are hereby incorporated by
reference and made as of the date hereof (and the term "Transactions" therein
shall include, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Amendment).

         (b)      The Borrower will pay to Katzman a fee in the amount of
$1,000,000 (the "Base Katzman Fee") plus an amount equal to interest thereon
(deemed interest) from the date hereof until paid in full at the rate of 12% per
annum (together with the Base Katzman Fee, the "Katzman Fee") as consideration
for his agreeing to execute and deliver the Pledge Agreement. Katzman shall
hereafter, for purposes of payment of the Katzman Fee, be deemed to be a Lender,
and as such shall be entitled to all the benefits of any and all the security
securing the Loans, including, without limitation, pursuant to the Security
Agreement, the Short-Form Patent Security Agreement, and the Short-Form
Trademark Security Agreement, each dated as of June 25, 2001. Borrower shall,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, take such further
actions as may be reasonably requested by Katzman necessary to perfect such
security interests of Katzman. Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is hereby deemed
amended to reflect the admission of Katzman as a Lender. Information concerning
Katzman's addresses for notices and payment information are contained in
Schedule 1 to this Amendment.

         Section 3. Loan Agreement Amendments. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 5 of this Amendment, the Loan Agreement is amended as

that the aggregate of the Loans owed to the Reservoir Lenders, including
principal, accrued interest, and any fees owed to the Reservoir Lenders as of
the date hereof, shall equal $9,500,000, exclusive of the transactions
contemplated by this Amendment.

         (b)      Section 2.06(a) of the Loan Agreement is deleted in its
entirety and the following shall be substituted therefor: "The Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the Lenders: (i) $3,500,000 by January 31,
2003, (ii) $4,000,000 by March 31, 2003, and (iii) the remainder of the Loans on
the Maturity Date."

         (c)      The term "Applicable Rate" as used in the Loan Agreement shall
mean 12% per annum. Section 2.08 of the Loan Agreement (captioned "Fees") is
deleted in its entirety.

         (d)      The Lenders agree that, notwithstanding section 2.07 of the
Loan Agreement or any other provision of the Loan Documents to the contrary, the
Lenders will consent to the allocation of proceeds of certain potential
dispositions in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement among the
parties hereto dated of even date herewith.

         additional $500,000 of the Loans, together with accrued, but unpaid
         interest thereon arising after the date of this Amendment, and an
         additional $500,000 of the Katzman Fee together with accrued deemed
         interest thereon, shall have been paid to Katzman and the Reservoir
         Lenders, 50% of such monies shall be paid to Katzman and 50% shall be
         paid to the Reservoir Lenders.
