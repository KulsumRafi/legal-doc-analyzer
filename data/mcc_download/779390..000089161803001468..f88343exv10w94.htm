</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Rod:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">As we have discussed, Aspect is offering this separation package in recognition
of your many contributions. This letter sets forth the terms and conditions of
your separation agreement and the parties mutual release of the other from any
liability. Please know that acceptance or rejection of this agreement will in
no way affect Aspect&#146;s obligation to pay your accrued salary through the
Resignation Date, including all unused accrued benefits, subject to the
standard payroll deductions and withholdings.

acknowledge that your services will be performed as an independent
contractor, not as an employee, and that you will not be eligible or
