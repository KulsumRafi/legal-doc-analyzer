     (b)  Shipper  agrees to indemnify  and hold  Transporter  harmless from all
          suits, actions,  debts, accounts,  damages, costs, losses and expenses

     permitted by the FERC or such other governmental body.

12.2 Any portions of this Agreement  necessary to resolve or cash-out imbalances
