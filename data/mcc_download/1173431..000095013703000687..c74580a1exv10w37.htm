payments remaining (rounded down to whole shares). Such shares of Stock shall
be distributed from shares reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan. If
a Participant dies before receiving all distributions to which he is entitled
under the Program, the Plan Administrator must be notified in writing. To be
effective, any beneficiary designation by a Participant must be in writing,
delivered and accepted by the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant&#146;s
death. In default of an effective beneficiary designation, the Participant&#146;s
estate shall be treated as his beneficiary for purposes of the Program.&#148;
