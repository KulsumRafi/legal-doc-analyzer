                          III. DUTIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

A.       The Contractor agrees to assume financial risk for developing and
         managing a health care delivery system and for arranging or
         administering all Hoosier Healthwise covered services except, as set
         out in section 3.4.3 of the BAA, dental care, long-term institutional
         care, services provided as part of an individualized education plan
         (IEP) pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
         (IDEA) at 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq., behavioral health, and hospice
         services, in exchange for a per-enrollee, per-month fixed fee, to
         certain enrollees in Hoosier Healthwise Packages A, B and C. Wards of
         the State, foster children and children receiving adoption assistance
         may enroll on a voluntary basis and will not be subject to
         auto-assignment into the Hoosier Healthwise program. The Contractor
         must, at a minimum, furnish covered services up to the limits specified
         by the Medicaid and CHIP programs. The Contractor may exceed these
         limits. However, in no instance may any covered service's limitations
         be more restrictive than those which exist in the Indiana Medicaid
         fee-for-service program for Packages A and B, and the Children's Health
         Insurance Program for Package C.

B.       The Contractor agrees to perform all duties and arrange and administer
         the provision of all services as set out herein and contained in the
         BAA as attached and the Contractor's responses to the BAA as attached,
         all of which are incorporated into this Contract by reference. In
         addition, the Contractor shall comply with all policies and procedures
         defined in any bulletin, manual, or handbook yet to be distributed by
         the State or its agents insofar as those policies and procedures
         provide further clarification and are no more restrictive than any
         policies and procedures contained in the BAA and any amendments to the
         BAA. The Contractor agrees to comply with all pertinent state and
         federal statutes and regulations in effect throughout the duration of
         this Contract and as they may be amended from time to time.

C.       The Contractor agrees that it will not discriminate against individuals
         eligible to be covered under this Contract on the basis of health
         status or need for health services; and the Contractor may not
         terminate an enrollee's enrollment, or act to encourage an enrollee to
         terminate his/her enrollment, because of an adverse change in the
         enrollee's health. The disenrollment function will be carried out by a
         State contractor who is independent of the Contractor; therefore, any
         request to terminate an enrollee's enrollment must be approved by the
         Offices.

D.       The Contractor agrees that no services or duties owed by the Contractor
         under this Contract will be performed or provided by any person or
         entity other than the Contractor, except as contained in written
         subcontracts or other legally binding agreements. Prior to entering
         into any such subcontract or other legally binding agreement, the
         Contractor shall, in each case, submit the proposed subcontract or
         other legally binding agreement to the Offices for prior review and
         approval. Prior review and approval of a subcontract or legally binding
         agreement shall not be unreasonably delayed by the Offices. The Offices
         shall, in appropriate cases and as requested by the Contractor,
         expedite the review and approval process. Under no circumstances shall



MCO Renewel Contract            Page 3 of 27             Managed Health Services
<PAGE>



         the Contractor be deemed to have breached its obligations under this
         Contract if such breach was a result of the Offices' failure to review
         and approve timely any proposed subcontract or other legally binding
         agreement. If the Offices disapprove any proposed subcontract or other
         legally binding agreement, the Offices shall state with reasonable
         particularity the basis for such disapproval. No subcontract into which
         the Contractor enters with respect to performance under this Contract
         shall in any way relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for the
         performance of duties under this Contract. All subcontracts and
         amendments thereto executed by the Contractor under this Contract must
         meet the following requirements; any existing subcontracts or legally
         binding agreements which fail to meet the following requirements shall
         be revised to include the requirements within ninety (90) days from the
         effective date of this Contract:

         1.       Be in writing and specify the functions of the subcontractor.

         2.       Be legally binding agreements.

         3.       Specify the amount, duration and scope of services to be
                  provided by the subcontractor.

                  other means, the quality, appropriateness, and timeliness of
                  services performed.

         5.       Provide for inspections of any records pertinent to the
                  contract by the Offices.

         6.       Require an adequate record system to be maintained for
                  recording services, charges, dates and all other commonly
                  accepted information elements for services rendered to
                  recipients under the contract.

         7.       Provide for the participation of the Contractor and
                  subcontractor in any internal and external quality assurance,
                  utilization review, peer review, and grievance procedures
                  established by the Contractor, in conjunction with the
                  Offices.

         8.       Provide that the subcontractor indemnify and hold harmless the
                  State of Indiana, its officers, and employees from all claims
                  and suits, including court costs, attorney's fees, and other
                  expenses, brought because of injuries or damage received or
                  sustained by any person, persons, or property that is caused
                  by any act or omission of the Contractor and/or the
                  subcontractors. The State shall not provide such
                  indemnification to the subcontractor.

         9.       Identify and incorporate the applicable terms of this Contract
                  and any incorporated documents. The subcontract shall provide
                  that the subcontractor agrees to perform duties under the
                  subcontract, as those duties pertain to enrollees, in
                  accordance with the applicable terms and conditions set out in
                  this Contract, any incorporated documents, and all applicable
                  state and federal laws, as amended.

         maintain, with any innetwork provider rendering health care services

         requirements:

         1.       Identify and incorporate the applicable terms of this Contract

                  applicable terms and conditions set out in this Contract, any
                  incorporated documents, and all applicable state and federal
                  laws, as amended, govern the duties and responsibilities of
                  the provider with regard to the provision of services to
                  enrollees.

         2.       Reference a written provider claim resolution procedure as set
                  out in section III.Q. below.

F.       The Contractor agrees that all laboratory testing sites providing
         services under this Contract must have a valid Clinical Laboratory
         Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate and comply with the CLIA
         regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 493.

G.       The Contractor agrees that it shall:

         1.       Retain, at all times during the period of this Contract, a
                  valid Certificate of Authority under applicable State laws
                  issued by the State of Indiana Department of Insurance.

         2.       Ensure that, during the term of this Contract, each provider
                  rendering health care services under the BAA is authorized to
                  do so in accordance with the following:

                  a.       The provider must maintain a current Indiana Health
                           Coverage Programs (IHCP) provider agreement and must
                           be duly licensed in accordance with the appropriate
                           state licensing board and shall remain in good
                           standing with said board.

                  b.       If a provider is not authorized to provide such
                           services under a current IHCP provider agreement or
                           is no longer licensed by said board, the Contractor
                           is obligated to terminate its contractual
                           relationship authorizing or requiring such provider
                           to provide services under the BAA. The Contractor
                           must terminate its contractual relationship with the
                           provider as soon as the Contractor has knowledge of

                  a.       The Contractor shall meet the definition of HMO as
                           specified in the Indiana State Medicaid Plan.

                  b.       Throughout the duration of this Contract, the
                           Contractor shall satisfy the Chicago Regional Office
                           of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
                           (hereinafter called CMS) that the Contractor is
                           compliant with the Federal requirements for
                           protection against insolvency pursuant to 42 CFR
                           434.20(c)(3) and 434.50(a), the requirement that the
                           Contractor shall continue to provide services to
                           Contractor enrollees until the end of the month in
                           which insolvency has occurred, and the requirement
                           that the Contractor shall continue to provide
                           inpatient services until the date of discharge for an
                           enrollee who is institutionalized when insolvency
                           occurs. The Contractor shall meet this requirement by
                           posting a performance bond pursuant to Section VII,
                           paragraph C, of this Contract, and satisfying the
                           statutory reserve requirements of the Indiana

                  c.       The Contractor shall comply with, and shall exclude
                           from participation as either a provider or

                           that has been excluded under the authority of

                  d.       In the event that the CMS determines that the
                           Contractor has violated any of the provisions of 42
                           CFR 434.67(a), CMS may deny payment of FFP for new
                           enrollees of the HMO under 42 USC 1396b(m)(5)(B)(ii).
                           The Offices shall automatically deny State payment
                           for new enrollees whenever, and for so long as,
                           Federal payment for such enrollees has been denied.

H.       The Contractor shall submit proof, satisfactory to the Offices, of
         indemnification of the Contractor by the Contractor's parent
         corporation, if applicable, and by all of its subcontractors.

I.       The Contractor shall submit proof, satisfactory to the Offices, that
         all subcontractors will hold the State harmless from liability under
         the subcontract. This assurance in no way relieves the Contractor of
         any responsibilities under the BAA or this Contract.

K.       The Contractor shall establish and maintain a quality improvement
         program that meets the requirements of 42 CFR 434.34, as well as other
         specific requirements set forth in the BAA. The Offices and the CMS may
         evaluate, through inspection or other means, including but not limited
         to, the review of the quality assurance reports required under this
         Contract, and the quality, appropriateness, and timeliness of services
         performed under this Contract. The Contractor agrees to participate and
         cooperate, as directed by the Offices, in the annual external quality
         review of the services furnished by the Contractor.

         Annual HEDIS rates must be submitted in a manner and timeline
         established by the Office, including but not limited, to HEDIS rates
         that have been audited by a HEDIS-certified audit firm within 30 days

         completed the certified audit may be submitted for 2003 HEDIS rates,
         but must be submitted for 2004 HEDIS rates and all other HEDIS rates in
         the future.

L.       In accordance with 42 CFR 434.28, the Contractor agrees that it and any
         of its subcontractors shall comply with the requirements, if
         applicable, of 42 CFR 489, Subpart I, relating to maintaining and
         distributing written policies and procedures respecting advance
         directives. The Contractor shall distribute policies and procedures to
         adult individuals during the enrollee enrollment process and whenever
         there are revisions to these policies and procedures. The Contractor
         shall make available for inspection, upon reasonable notice and request
         by the Offices, documentation concerning its written policies,
         procedures and distribution of such written procedures to enrollees.

M.       Pursuant to 42 C.F.R. 417.479(a), the Contractor agrees that no
         specific payment can be made directly or indirectly under a physician
         incentive plan to a physician or physician group as an inducement to
         reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished to an individual
         enrollee. The Contractor must disclose to the State the information on
         provider incentive plans listed in 42 C.F.R. 417.479(h)(1) and
         417.479(i) at the times indicated at 42 C.F.R. 434.70(a)(3), in order
         to determine whether the incentive plan meets the requirements of 42
         C.F.R. 417(d)-(g). The Contractor must provide the capitation data
         required under paragraph (h)(1)(vi) for the previous calendar year to
         the State by application/contract renewal of each year. The Contractor
         will provide the information on its physician incentive plan(s) listed
         in 42 C.F.R. 417.479(h)(3) to any enrollee upon request.

N.       The Contractor must not prohibit or restrict a health care professional
         from advising an enrollee about his/her health status, medical care, or
         treatment, regardless of whether benefits for such care are provided
         under this Contract, if the professional is acting within the lawful
         scope of practice. However, this provision does not require the
         Contractor to provide coverage of a counseling or referral service if
         the Contractor objects to the service on moral or religious grounds and
         makes available information on its policies to potential enrollees and
         enrollees within ninety (90) days after the date the Contractor adopts
         a change in policy regarding such counseling or referral service.

O.       In accordance with 42 U.S.C.ss. 1396u-2(b)(6), the Contractor agrees
         that an enrollee may not be held liable for the following:

         1.       Debts of the Contractor, or its subcontractors, in the event
                  of any organization's insolvency;

         2.       Services provided to the enrollee in the event the Contractor
                  fails to receive payment from the Offices for such services or
                  in the event a provider fails to receive payment from the
                  Contractor or Offices; or

         3.       Payments made to a provider in excess of the amount that would
                  be owed by the enrollee if the Contractor had directly
                  provided the services.

P.       The Offices may from time to time request and the Contractor, and all
         of its subcontractors, agree that the Contractor, or its
         subcontractors, shall prepare and submit additional compilations and
         reports as requested by the Offices. Such requests will be limited to
         situations in which the desired data is considered essential and cannot
         be obtained through existing Contractor reports. The Contractor, and
         all of its subcontractors, agree that a response to the request shall
         be submitted within thirty (30) days from the date of the request, or
         by the Offices' requested completion date, whichever is earliest. The
         response shall include the additional compilations and reports as
         requested, or the status of the requested information and an expected
         completion date. When such requests pertain to legislative inquiries or
         expedited inquiries from the Office of the Governor, the additional
         compilations and reports shall be submitted by the Offices' requested
         completion date. Failure by the Contractor, or its subcontractors, to
         comply with response time frames shall be considered grounds for the
         Offices to pursue the provisions outlined in Section 3.16.5 of the BAA.
         In the event that delays in submissions are a consequence of a delay by
         the Offices or the Medicaid Fiscal Agent, the time frame for submission
         shall be extended by the length of time of the delay.

Q.       The Contractor shall establish a written claim resolution procedure
         applicable to both in-network and out-of-network providers which shall
         be distributed to all in-network providers and shall be available to
         out-of-network providers upon request. The Contractor shall negotiate
         the terms of a written claim resolution procedure with in-network
         providers individually; but if the Contractor and an in-network
         provider are unable to reach agreement on the terms of such procedure,
         the out-of-network provider claims resolution procedure approved by the
         Offices under this section shall govern the resolution of such
         in-network provider's claims with the Contractor.

         1.       A statement noting that providers objecting to determinations
                  involving their claims will be provided due process through
                  the Contractor's claim resolution procedure.

         2.       A description of both the informal and formal claim resolution
                  procedures that will be available to resolve a provider's
                  objection to a determination involving the provider's claim.

         3.       An informal claim resolution procedure which:

                  a.       shall be available for the resolution of claims
                           submitted to the Contractor by the provider within
                           120 days after the date on which services were
                           rendered;

                  b.       shall precede the formal claim resolution procedure;

                  c.       shall be used to resolve a provider's objection to a
                           determination by the Contractor involving the
                           provider's claim, including a provider's objection
                           to:

                           (1) any determination by the Contractor regarding
                           payment for a claim submitted by the provider,
                           including the amount of such payment; and

                           (2) the Contractor's determination that a claim
                           submitted by the provider lacks sufficient supporting
                           information, records, or other materials;

                  d.       may, at the election of a provider, be utilized to
                           determine the payment due for a claim in the event
                           the Contractor fails, within thirty (30) days after
                           the provider submits the claim, to notify the
                           provider of:

                           (1) its determination regarding payment for the
                           provider's claim; or

                           (2) its determination that the provider's claim
                           lacked sufficient supporting information, records, or
                           other materials;

                  e.       shall be commenced by a provider submitting to the
                           Contractor:

                           (1) within sixty (60) days after the provider's
                           receipt of written notification of the Contractor's
                           determination regarding the provider's claim, the
                           provider's written objection to the Contractor's
                           determination and an explanation of the objection; or

                           (2) within sixty (60) days after the Contractor fails
                           to make a determination as described in subparagraph
                           (d), a written notice of the provider's election to
                           utilize the informal claims resolution procedure
                           under subparagraph (d) above;

                  f.       shall allow providers and the Contractor to make
                           verbal inquiries and to otherwise informally
                           undertake to resolve the matter submitted for
                           resolution by the provider.

         4.       In the event the matter submitted for informal resolution is
                  not resolved to the provider's satisfaction within thirty (30)
                  days after the provider commenced the informal claim
                  resolution procedure, the provider shall have sixty (60) days
                  from that point to submit to the Contractor written
                  notification of the provider's election to submit the matter
                  to the formal claim resolution procedure. The provider's
                  notice must specify the basis of the provider's dispute with
                  the Contractor. The Contractor's receipt of the provider's
                  written notice shall commence the formal claim resolution
                  procedure.

         5.       The formal claim resolution procedure shall be conducted by a
                  panel of one (1) or more individuals selected by the
                  Contractor. Each panel must be knowledgeable about the policy,
                  legal, and clinical issues involved in the matter that is the
                  subject of the formal claim resolution procedure. An
                  individual who has been involved in any previous consideration
                  of the matter by the Contractor may not serve on the panel.
                  The Contractor's medical director, or another licensed
                  physician designated by the medical director, shall serve as a
                  consultant to the panel in the event the matter involves a
                  question of medical necessity or medical appropriateness.

         6.       The panel shall consider all information and material
                  submitted to it by the provider that bears directly upon an
                  issue involved in the matter that is the subject of the formal



MCO Renewel Contract            Page 9 of 27             Managed Health Services




<PAGE>

                  claim resolution procedure. The panel shall allow the provider
                  an opportunity to appear in person before the panel, or to
                  communicate with the panel through appropriate other means if
                  the provider is unable to appear in person, and question the
                  panel in regard to issues involved in the matter. The provider
                  shall not be required to be represented by an attorney for
                  purposes of the formal claim review procedure.

         7.       Within forty-five (45) days after the commencement of the
                  formal claim resolution procedure, the panel shall deliver to
                  the provider the panel's written determination of the matter
                  before it. Such determination shall be the Contractor's final
                  position in regard to the matter. The written determination
                  shall include, as applicable, a detailed explanation of the
                  factual, legal, policy and clinical basis of the panel's
                  determination.

         8.       In the event the panel fails to deliver to the provider the
                  panel's written determination within forty-five (45) days
                  after the after the commencement of the formal claim
                  resolution procedure, such failure on the part of the panel
                  shall have the effect of a denial by the panel of the
                  provider's claim.

         9.       The panel's written determination shall include notice to the
                  provider of the provider's right, within sixty (60) days after
                  the provider's receipt of the panel's written determination,
                  to submit to binding arbitration the matter that was the
                  subject of the formal claim resolution procedure. The provider
                  shall also have the right to submit the matter to binding
                  arbitration if the panel has failed to deliver its written
                  determination to the provider within the required forty-five
                  (45) day period.

         10.      Any procedure involving binding arbitration must be conducted
                  in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American
                  Health Lawyers Association (AHLA), pursuant to the Uniform
                  Arbitration Act as adopted in the State of Indiana at I.C.
                  34-57-2, unless the provider and Contractor mutually agree to
                  some other binding resolution procedure. However, any
                  Contractor and provider that are subject to statutorily
                  imposed arbitration procedures for the resolution of these
                  claims shall be required to follow the statutorily imposed
                  arbitration procedures, but only to the extent those
                  procedures differ from, or are irreconcilable with, the rules
                  and regulations of the American Health Lawyers Association
                  (AHLA), pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act as adopted in
                  the State of Indiana at I.C. 34-57-2.

         11.      A provider may, within the requisite sixty (60) day time
                  period, include in a single arbitration proceeding matters
                  from multiple formal claim resolution procedures involving the
                  Contractor and the provider.

         12.      For claims disputed under Paragraph 3. c. (2) above:

                  a.       a claim that is finally determined through the
                           Contractor's claim resolution procedure (including
                           arbitration) not to lack sufficient supporting
                           documentation shall be processed by the Contractor
                           within thirty (30) days after such final

                           determination. The processing of the claim and the
                           Contractor's determination involving the claim shall
                           be subject to Paragraph 3. c. and Paragraph 3. d. and
                           the Contractor's formal claim resolution procedure
                           and binding arbitration.

                  b.       a claim that is finally determined through the
                           Contractor's claim resolution procedure (including
                           arbitration) to lack sufficient supporting
                           documentation shall be processed by the Contractor
                           within thirty (30) days after the provider submits to
                           the Contractor the requisite supporting
                           documentation. The provider shall have thirty (30)
                           days after written notice of the final determination
                           establishing that the claim lacked sufficient
                           supporting documentation is received by the provider
                           to submit the requisite supporting documentation. The
                           processing of the claim and the Contractor's
                           determination involving the claim shall be subject to
                           Paragraph 3. c. and Paragraph 3. d. and the
                           Contractor's formal claim resolution procedure and
                           binding arbitration.

         13.      A Contractor may not include in its claim resolution
                  procedures elements that restrict or diminish the claim review
                  procedures, time periods or subject matter provided for in
                  paragraphs 1 through l2 above.

         14.      A Contractor shall maintain a log of all informally and
                  formally filed provider objections to determinations involving
                  claims. The logged information shall include the provider's
                  name, date of objection, nature of the objection, and
                  disposition. The Contractor shall submit quarterly reports to
                  the Offices regarding the number and type of provider
                  objections.

R.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, Section 3.6.1.3 of the BAA is amended
         to require the Contractor to submit the "Mandatory RBMC Transition
         Report" (Attachment A) according the schedule set out in the "2002
         Hoosier Healthwise MCO Reporting Calendar for Mandatory RBMC Transition

         report, is/are no longer required or may be reported less frequently.
         Pursuant to the reporting calendar (Attachment B), the final submission
         shall be due on January 6, 2003.

S.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, Section 3.6.3 of the BAA is amended to
         require the Contractor to obtain written approval of the State prior to

         requirements for the member and provider helplines described in
         Sections 3.6.6. and 3.6.7.3 of this BAA. Because actual damages caused
         by non-compliance are not subject to exact determination, the State
         will assess the MCO, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, (a)
         two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each business day the MCO fails to
         submit required documentation to provide evidence of compliance with
         this requirement, or (b) two thousand dollars ($2000.00) for each month
         the MCO fails to meet the requirement after 2 consecutive months of
         non-compliance on the member helpline or (c) two thousand dollars
         ($2000.00) for each month the MCO fails to meet the requirement after 2
         consecutive months of non-compliance on the provider helpline.

U.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, Section 3.5.3 of the BAA is amended to

         upon reasonable and adequate prior written notice to the Contractor.

V.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, Section 3.6.3 of the BAA is amended to
         require the Contractor to develop and adhere to a plan for identifying

         applicable federal requirements.

W.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, the Contractor agrees to provide OMPP
         with prior written notice at least ninety (90) days in advance of their
         inability to maintain a sufficient Primary Medical Provider (PMP)
         network in any of the counties where mandatory RBMC has been or will be
         implemented, including Marion, Allen, Elkhart, St. Joseph, Lake,
         Hamilton, and Vanderburgh Counties, such that the program would not be
         able to maintain the appropriate member choice of two (2) MCOs,
         pursuant to federal requirements.

X.       In accordance with the First Amendment to the original contract between
         the parties dated April 1, 2002, the Contractor agrees that agreements
         with PMPs in mandatory counties shall comply with the following

</TABLE>

B.       The actuarial basis for computing the rates set forth above is as
         follows: The capitation rates have been determined from historical
         Hoosier Healthwise claim experience for the PCCM enrollees. The
         historical experience has been adjusted to reflect anticipated trend in
         the Hoosier Healthwise program, cost containment initiatives, morbidity
         variations between the PCCM and RBMC enrollees, and anticipated managed
         care utilization adjustments. The Offices may rely on self-report RBMC
         experience to determine appropriate managed care utilization
         adjustments and other morbidity variation adjustments.

C.       The parties agree that the Offices have the option to adjust the
         capitation rates annually. In the event that the Offices adjust the
         fee-for-service (FFS) rates, the Offices may, in its sole discretion,
         further adjust the capitation rates in accordance with the FFS




MCO Renewel Contract           Page 14 of 27             Managed Health Services

<PAGE>

         adjustment. If the Offices made such an adjustment, it shall apply only
         to the specific service component of the capitation rate that
         corresponds to the FFS adjustment. Any capitation rates adjusted due to
         a change in the FFS program may be further adjusted to ensure actuarial
         soundness. All adjustments are subject to federal regulations for risk
         contracts. Rates revised under this provision shall be implemented only
         after a contract amendment is executed and approved.

D.       All payment obligations of the Offices are subject to the encumbrance
         of monies and shall be paid to the Contractor on the first Wednesday
         after the fifteenth of the month.

E.       The capitation payment will be prospective, based upon the number of
         enrollees assigned to the Contractor as of the first of the month. The
         Offices will establish an administrative procedure to allow retroactive
         or other payment adjustments as necessary to implement this contract.

F.       The Contractor will be provided a capitation payment listing which
         includes a detailed listing of all enrollees for which the Contractor
         is receiving a capitation payment.

G.       It is understood and agreed upon by the parties that all obligations of
         the State of Indiana are contingent upon the availability and continued
         appropriation of State and Federal funds, and in no event shall the
         State of Indiana be liable for any payments in excess of available
         appropriated funds.

H.       When the Director of the State Budget Agency makes a written
         determination that funds are not appropriated or otherwise available to
         support continuation of performance of this Contract, the Contract
         shall be cancelled. A determination by the State Budget Director that
         funds are not appropriated or otherwise available to support
         continuation of performance shall be final and conclusive.



                             V. ORDER OF PRECEDENCE

                          VII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


A.       Entire Agreement. This Contract constitutes the entire agreement
         between the parties with respect to the subject matter; all prior
         agreements, representations, statements, negotiations, and undertakings
         are superseded hereby.

B.       Changes. Any changes to this Contract shall be by formal amendment of
         this Contract signed by all parties required by Indiana law.

C.       Termination. The Office may, without cause, cancel and terminate this
         Contract in whole or in part upon sixty (60) days' prior written
         notice. The Contractor will be reimbursed for services performed prior
         to the date of termination consistent with the terms of the Contract.
         The Office will not be liable for services performed after notice of
         termination, but before the date of termination, without written
         authorization from the Office. In no event will the Office be liable
         for services performed after the termination date.

         In the event that the Office requests that the Contractor perform any
         additional services associated with the transition or turnover of the
         contract, the Office agrees to pay reasonable costs for those
         additional services specifically requested by the Office. Any
         additional services and costs must receive prior approval in writing by
         the Office.

D.       Disputes. Should any disputes arise with respect to this Contract, the
         Contractor and the State of Indiana agree to act immediately to resolve
         any such disputes. Time is of the essence in the resolution of
         disputes.




MCO Renewel Contract           Page 16 of 27             Managed Health Services

<PAGE>


         The Contractor agrees that, the existence of a dispute notwithstanding,
         it will continue without delay to carry out all of its responsibilities
         under this Contract which are not affected by the dispute. Should the
         Contractor fail to continue without delay to perform its
         responsibilities under this Contract in the accomplishment of all
         non-disputed work, any additional costs incurred by the Contractor or
         the State of Indiana as a result of such failure to proceed shall be
         borne by the Contractor, and the Contractor shall make no claim against
         the State of Indiana for such costs. If the Contractor and the State of
         Indiana cannot resolve a dispute within ten (10) working days following
         notification in writing by either party of the existence of said
         dispute, then the following procedure shall apply:

         1.       The parties agree to resolve such matters through submission
                  of their dispute to the Commissioner of the Indiana Department
                  of Administration who shall reduce a decision to writing and
                  mail or otherwise furnish a copy thereof to the Contractor and
                  the State of Indiana within ten (10) working days after
                  presentation of such dispute for decision. The Commissioner's
                  decision shall be final and conclusive unless either party
                  mails or otherwise furnishes to the Commissioner, within ten
                  (10) working days after receipt of the Commissioner's
                  decision, a written appeal. Within ten (10) working days of
                  receipt by the Commissioner of a written request for appeal,
                  the decision may be reconsidered. If no reconsideration is
                  provided within ten (10) working days the Contractor may
                  submit the dispute to an Indiana court of competent
                  jurisdiction.

         2.       The State of Indiana may withhold payments on disputed items
                  pending resolution of the dispute. The non-payment by the
                  State of Indiana to the Contractor of one or more invoices not
                  in dispute shall not constitute default, however, the
                  Contractor may bring suit to collect such monies without
                  following the disputes procedure contained herein.

E.       Debarment and Suspension. Contractor certifies, by entering into this
         agreement, that neither it nor its principals are presently debarred,
         suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
         excluded from entering into this agreement by any federal agency or
         department, agency or political subdivision of the State of Indiana.
         The term "principal" for the purposes of this agreement is defined as
         an officer, director, owner, partner, key employee, or other person
         with primary management or supervisory responsibilities or a person who
         has a critical influence on or substantive control over the operations
         of the Contractor.

F.       Compliance with Laws. The Contractor agrees to comply with all
         applicable Federal, State, and local laws, rules, regulations, or
         ordinances, and all provisions required thereby to be included herein
         are hereby incorporated by reference. The enactment of any state or
         federal statute or the promulgation of regulations thereunder after
         execution of this Contract shall be reviewed by the State and the
         Contractor to determine whether the provisions of the Contract require
         formal modification.



MCO Renewel Contract           Page 17 of 27             Managed Health Services

<PAGE>


G.       Indemnification. Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
         harmless the State of Indiana and its agents, officers, and employees
         from all claims and suits including court costs, attorney's fees, and
         other expenses caused by any act or omission of the Contractor and/or
         its subcontractors, if any. The State shall not provide such
         indemnification to the Contractor.

H.       Nondiscrimination. Pursuant to IC 22-9-1-10 and the Civil Rights Act of
         1964, Contractor and its subcontractors shall not discriminate against
         any employee or applicant for employment in the performance of this
         contract. The Contractor shall not discriminate with respect to the
         hire, tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment or any
         matter directly or indirectly related to employment, because of race,
         color, religion, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry. Breach
         of this covenant may be regarded as a material breach of contract.
         Acceptance of this Contract also signifies compliance with applicable
         federal laws, regulations, and executive orders prohibiting
         discrimination in the provision of services based on race, color,
         national origin, age, sex, disability, or status as a veteran. The
         Contractor understands that the State is a recipient of federal funds.
         Pursuant to that understanding, the Contractor and its subcontractor,
         if any, agree that if the Contractor employs fifty (50) or more
         employees and does at least fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000.00) worth

                  the Contractor becomes aware;

         4.       Ensuring that any subcontractors or agents to whom the
                  Contractor provides PHI received from, or created or received

                  Office's compliance with applicable law. The Contractor shall
                  immediately notify the Office upon receipt by the Contractor
                  of any such request, and shall provide the Office with copies
                  of any materials made available in response to such a request;
