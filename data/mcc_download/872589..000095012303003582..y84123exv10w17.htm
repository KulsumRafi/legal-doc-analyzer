member of a board of directors of any other for-profit corporation (other than
a Related Entity) without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). In no event will the
provisions of this Agreement in any way modify, alter, reduce, or limit the

accordance with the Company&#146;s payroll practices for salaried employees.
Adjustments in your base salary during the term of this Agreement (which shall
thereafter be your &#147;Base Salary&#148;) may be effected from time to time upon the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee and the approval of the Board of
Directors based upon an annual review by the Compensation Committee, but your
Base Salary, once increased, shall in no event be decreased; <I>provided, however,</I>
that in the event there is a general reduction of compensation applicable to
senior executives generally, nothing herein shall preclude the Board of
Director&#146;s ability to reduce your Base Salary consistent with this reduction.
You shall also participate in and be the beneficiary of any cash bonus
payments, stock option and other equity programs, incentive programs, pension
plans, profit sharing plans and other benefit programs and fringe benefit
programs implemented by the Company and otherwise available to executive

Company and the stock options to purchase common shares previously granted to
you shall remain outstanding, and in effect, in accordance with their
respective terms.

membership; (ii)&nbsp;if permitted by the Club, have the Company transfer the

other Club expenses incurred thereafter and, if you assumed the bond, would pay
the Company the amount of the bond); or (iii)&nbsp;have the Company continue your
designation as nominee for the Company&#146;s Club membership (in which case you

adult member of your immediate family), and reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Such physician&#146;s written determination of your Permanent Disability

authorization, during your employment under this Agreement and, if your
employment ends as a result of your voluntary termination of employment
pursuant to paragraph 4(e), for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year thereafter (six (6)

such engagement, interest, or involvement shall be as an employer, officer,
director, owner shareholder, employee, partner, consultant, or in any other

passive investment of less than one (1%) of the stock of any publicly traded

Business in the manner described in the foregoing clause (i); <I>provided,
further, </I>that this shall not preclude you from providing investment banking
services to or on behalf of an entity after your termination of employment that

aware of this provision, that employer can take such action as to avoid your
breach of this provision and to indemnify you in the event of a breach.

plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions
result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code or any person affiliated with the Company or such
person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control
(collectively the &#147;Company Payments&#148;), and such Company Payments will be
subject to the tax (the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;) imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (and
any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the
Company shall pay to you at the time specified in subsection (d)&nbsp;below (x)&nbsp;an
additional amount (the &#147;Gross-up Payment&#148;) such that the net amount retained by
you, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S.
federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment
provided for by this paragraph (a), but before deduction for any U.S. federal,
state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal
to the Company Payments and (y)&nbsp;an amount equal to the product of any
deductions disallowed for federal, state or local income tax purposes because
of the inclusion of the Gross-Up Payment in your adjusted gross income
multiplied by the highest applicable marginal rate of federal, state or local
income taxation, respectively, for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
Payment is to be made.

entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that if the Company Payments (other than
that portion valued under Q&#038;A 24(c) of the proposed regulations under Section
280G of the Code(the &#147;Stock Vesting Value&#148;)) (the &#147;Cash Payments&#148;) are reduced
by the amount necessary such that the receipt of the Company Payments would not
give rise to any Excise Tax (the &#147;Reduced Payment&#148;) and the Reduced Payment
(other than the Stock Vesting Value) would not be less than 90% of the Cash
Payment, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to you and the Cash Payments,
in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Payments (other than the
Stock Vesting Value). If the Reduced Payments is to be effective, payments
shall be reduced as mutually agreed between the Company and you or, in the
event the parties cannot agree, in the following order (1)&nbsp;any lump sum
severance based on a multiple of Base Salary or annual bonus, (2)&nbsp;any other
cash amounts payable to you and (3)&nbsp;any benefits valued as parachute payments.

whether (ii)&nbsp;applies.

opinion, delivered to the Company and you at a level of more likely than not,
of the Company&#146;s independent certified public accountants appointed prior to
any change in ownership (as defined under Section&nbsp;280G(b)(2) of the Code) or
tax counsel selected by such accountants (the &#147;Accountants&#148;) such Total
Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute &#147;parachute payments,&#148;

you may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm to

shall be made by the Accountants which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and you at such time as it is requested by the
Company or you. If the Accountants determine that payments under this
Agreement must be reduced pursuant to this paragraph, they shall furnish you
with a written opinion to such effect. The determination of the Accountants
shall be final and binding upon the Company and you, subject to the other
provisions herein.

Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal
rate of taxation in the state and locality of your residence for the calendar
year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction
in U.S. federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such
state and local taxes if paid in such year. In the event that the Excise Tax
is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken
into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, you shall
repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise
Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross-up Payment
attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment
attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S. federal, state and local income tax
imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by you if such
repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S. federal, state and
local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at
the rate provided in Section&nbsp;1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to
the Company has been paid to any U.S. federal, state and local tax authority,
repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual
refund or credit of such portion has been made to you, and interest payable to
the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to you by such
tax authority for the period it held such portion. Furthermore, to the extent
the foregoing provision shall be deemed to create a loan of a personal nature
in violation of Section&nbsp;402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the provision
for repayment shall be null and void. You and the Company shall mutually agree
upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the
expense thereof) if your claim for refund or credit is denied.
