<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</B></FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, made and entered into as of the 1st day of
November, 2001, by and between Wachovia Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), a North
Carolina corporation, and ROBERT P. KELLY (the &#147;Executive&#148;);
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Management Resources &#038; Compensation Committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
to assure that the Company will have the continued service of the Executive.
The Committee believes it is imperative to encourage the Executive&#146;s full
attention and dedication to the Company, and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a termination of employment with
the Company which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the
Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other
corporations.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in order to accomplish the objectives set forth above and
in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereby
agree as follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Period. (a)&nbsp;The &#147;Effective Date&#148; shall mean the date
hereof.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company hereby agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and
the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ of the Company upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period commencing on
the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary thereof (the &#147;Employment
Period&#148;); provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the
date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each
annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Renewal
Date&#148;), unless previously terminated, the Employment Period shall be
automatically extended so as to terminate three years from such Renewal Date,
unless at least 90&nbsp;days prior to the Renewal Date the Company or the Executive,
respectively, shall give notice to the Executive or the Company, respectively,
that the Employment Period shall not be so extended. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event a &#147;Change in Control&#148; (as defined herein) occurs, the
Employment Period, unless previously terminated, shall be extended immediately
prior to the Change in Control so that the Employment Period shall terminate no
earlier than three years from such Change in Control.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms of Employment. (a)&nbsp;Positions and Duties. (i)&nbsp;During the
Employment Period, the Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive agrees to serve as an employee of the Company and as an employee of
one or more of its subsidiaries. The Executive shall perform such duties and
responsibilities, in such capacity and with such authority, for the Company (or
one or more of its subsidiaries) as the Company may designate from time to
time. Such duties shall be of a type for which the Executive is suited by
background, experience and training, in the Company&#146;s reasonable discretion.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Employment Period,
and excluding any periods of vacation
and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to

<P><FONT size="2"> devote his full professional attention and time during normal business
hours to the business and affairs of the Company and to perform the
responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder. During the Employment
Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A)
serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (B)&nbsp;deliver
lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions,
and (C)&nbsp;manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not
interfere with the performance of the Executive&#146;s responsibilities as an
employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement and are consistent
with the Company&#146;s policies. It is expressly understood and agreed that to the
extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to
the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of
activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective
Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the
Executive&#146;s responsibilities to the Company.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation. (i)&nbsp;Salary and Bonus. For all services rendered by the
Executive in any capacity under this Agreement, the Company shall pay the
Executive during the Employment Period as compensation (i)&nbsp;an annual salary in
an amount not less than the amount of the Executive&#146;s annual salary as of the
Effective Date (the &#147;Annual Base Salary&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;such annual cash incentive
bonus, if any, as may be awarded to him by the Board or by a Committee
designated by the Board (the &#147;Annual Bonus&#148;); provided, however, the Annual
Bonus paid to the Executive for the fiscal year 2001 shall not be less than
$675,000. Such salary shall be payable in accordance with the Company&#146;s
customary payroll practices, and any such bonus shall be payable in cash in
accordance with the Company&#146;s incentive bonus plans from which the Annual Bonus
is awarded. During the Employment Period prior to the Date of Termination, the
Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed in accordance with the Company&#146;s policies
and procedures applicable to the Executive and may be increased from time to
time consistent with such procedures. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall
not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this
Agreement. In the event the Executive&#146;s actual Annual Base Salary is increased
above the then current Annual Base Salary during the Employment Period, such
increased Annual Base Salary shall constitute &#147;Annual Base Salary&#148; for purposes
of this Agreement, and may not thereafter be reduced except with the written
consent of the Executive.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee
Benefits. During the Employment Period prior to the Date of
Termination, the Executive and/or the Executive&#146;s family, as the case may be,
shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans generally available
to other peer executives of the Company or its subsidiaries, including without
limitation, employee stock purchase plans, savings plans, retirement plans,
welfare benefit plans (including, without limitation, medical, prescription,
dental, disability, life, accidental death, and travel accident insurance, but
excluding severance plans) and similar plans, practices, policies and programs.
In addition, during the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to
participate in the Company&#146;s stock-based incentive compensation plans then
available to other peer executives of the Company with awards thereunder
determined by the Board or by a Committee designated by the Board, in its sole
discretion, except as provided in this Agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringe Benefits. During the Employment Period prior to the Date of
Termination, the Executive shall be entitled to fringe benefits and perquisite
plans or programs of the Company and its affiliated companies generally
available to executives who are peers of the Executive; provided that the
Company reserves the right to modify, change or terminate such fringe benefits

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification/D&#038;O Insurance. During the Employment Period for acts
prior to the Date of Termination, the Executive shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to the performance of his duties hereunder, and
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance, on the same terms and conditions
as generally available to other peer executives of the Company and its
affiliated companies.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Employment. (a)&nbsp;Retirement, Death or Disability. The
Executive&#146;s employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive&#146;s death
or Retirement (as defined herein) during the Employment Period. For purposes
of this Agreement, &#147;Retirement&#148; shall mean either (i)&nbsp;voluntary termination by
the Executive of the Executive&#146;s employment upon satisfaction of the
requirements for early retirement under the Company&#146;s tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan or (ii)&nbsp;voluntary termination by the Executive of the
Executive&#146;s employment upon satisfaction of the requirements for normal
retirement under the terms of the Company&#146;s tax-qualified pension plan. If the
Company determines in good faith that Disability of the Executive has occurred
during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability set
forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
this Agreement of its intention to terminate the Executive&#146;s employment. In
such event, the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company shall terminate
effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the
&#147;Disability Effective Date&#148;), provided that, within the 30&nbsp;days after such
receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the
Executive&#146;s duties. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Disability&#148; shall mean
termination of the Executive&#146;s employment upon satisfaction of the requirements
to receive benefits under the Company&#146;s long-term disability plan.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive&#146;s employment during

mean:

willful failure of the Executive to perform
substantially the Executive&#146;s duties with the Company or one of its affiliates
(other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or
mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to the Executive by the Company which specifically identifies the
manner in which the Company believes that the Executive has not substantially
performed the Executive&#146;s duties and a reasonable time for such substantial
performance has elapsed since delivery of such demand, or

misconduct which is materially injurious to the Company.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the
Executive, shall be considered &#147;willful&#148; unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
Executive&#146;s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution
duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chairman of the Board
or a senior executive officer of the Company or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted
to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the
Company. Following a Change in Control (as defined herein), the Company&#146;s
termination of the Executive&#146;s employment shall not be deemed to be for Cause
unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths
of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held
for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the
Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before
such Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of such Board, the
Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;above,

of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such
notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than 30

which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any
