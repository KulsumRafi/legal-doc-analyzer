            located outside the United States), Borrower shall cause such
            institution, within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, to
            enter into a control agreement in form acceptable to Bank in its
            good faith business judgment in order to perfect Bank's

            "As to any Deposit Accounts and investment accounts maintained with
            another institution (other than disbursement or payroll accounts
            which Borrower is permitted hereunder to maintain with institutions
            located outside the United States), Borrower shall cause such
            institution, within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, to
            enter into a control agreement in form acceptable to Bank in its
            good faith business judgment in order to perfect Bank's
            first-priority security interest in said Deposit Accounts and
            investment accounts, provided that Borrower may retain up to a total
            not to exceed $150,000 (net of outstanding checks or similar
            immediately pending debits) in Deposit Accounts at Comerica Bank
            without causing Comerica Bank to enter into a control agreement with
            respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
            Borrower shall make all of its payroll payments from Deposit
            Accounts maintained at Bank on and after March 20, 2003, and
            Borrower shall make all of its payable payments from Deposit
            Accounts maintained at Bank on and after March 30, 2003."

      5.    FEE. In consideration for Silicon entering into this Amendment,
Borrower shall concurrently pay Silicon a fee in the amount of $30,000, which

to Silicon under the Loan Documents. Silicon is authorized to charge said fee to
Borrower's loan account.
