     Section  3.3.  Termination  of  this  Amendment.   This  Amendment  may  be
terminated  by  either  party at any time if a final and  non-appealable  order,
ruling or  injunction  of any court of  competent  jurisdiction  shall have been
issued and the effect of such order,  ruling or injunction is to render (i) this
Amendment or the MSA Amendment  invalid or  unenforceable by such party, or (ii)
the approval by the Long Island Power  Authority  of the  Amendment  dated as of
March  29,  2002  (the  "GPRA  Amendment")  to  the  Generation  Purchase  Right
Agreement,  dated as of June 26, 1997, by and between KeySpan and LIPA,  invalid
and thereby causing the GPRA Amendment to be invalid and  unenforceable by LIPA.
Such termination  shall be effective  immediately upon the giving of a notice of
such  termination  to the other party.  This  Amendment may not be terminated by
either party if a final and  non-appealable  order,  ruling or injunction of any
court of a competent  jurisdiction shall have been issued and the effect of such
order,  ruling or  injunction  is to render the  approval of the GPRA  Amendment
invalid for reason that the Long Island Power  Authority did not seek  requisite
governmental approvals.

     Section 3.4. Miscellaneous.  Except as amended hereby, the EMA shall remain
in full force and effect. This Amendment shall be governed,  including,  without
limitation, as to validity,  interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State
