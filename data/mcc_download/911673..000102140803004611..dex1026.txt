     to be, for the period from October 1, 2001 through and including the date
     that is 10 Business Days after October 1, 2001, the amount of the Earn-Out

by this Amendment and all documents, instruments and other legal matters
incident thereto shall be satisfactory to Agent and its legal counsel;

Subsidiaries, or in the Collateral since December 31, 2000.

     4.   Representations and Warranties. To induce Agent and Lenders to enter
into this Amendment, each Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders:

been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of each
Borrower and that this Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by each
Borrower; and

     (b)  that each of the representations and warranties set forth in the
Credit Agreement (other than those which, by their terms, specifically are made
as of certain date prior to the date hereof) and in each Loan Document are true
and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof.

     5.   Severability. Any provision of this Amendment held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable shall not impair or
invalidate the remainder of this Amendment and the effect thereof shall be
confined to the provision so held to be invalid or unenforceable.

counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which taken
together shall be one and the same instrument.

     8.   Ratification. The terms and provisions set forth in this Amendment
shall modify and supersede all inconsistent terms and provisions of the Credit
Agreement and shall not be deemed to be a consent to the modification or waiver
of any other term or condition of the Credit Agreement. Except as expressly
modified and superseded by this Amendment, the terms and provisions of the
Credit Agreement are ratified and confirmed and shall continue in full force and
effect. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not
operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Agent or any Lender under
the Credit Agreement or any Loan Document to which Agent or such Lender is a
party nor constitute a waiver of any provision in or
