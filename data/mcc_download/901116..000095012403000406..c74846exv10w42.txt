                                    dated as of February 10, 2003 (this
                                    "Agreement"), among LPA HOLDING CORP., a
                                    Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"),
                                    LPA INVESTMENT LLC, a Delaware limited
                                    liability company ("LPA Investment"), and
                                    the parties signatory hereto, if any, from
                                    time to time (each, an "Other Purchaser").
                                    Each Other Purchaser and LPA Investment are
                                    collectively referred to as the
                                    "Purchasers."

         WHEREAS, the Corporation desires to issue and sell to the Purchasers,
and the Purchasers desire to purchase (subject to the conditions set forth
herein) from the Corporation, (a) shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable
Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation, $0.01 par value ("Series B

the Certificate of Designations; and (b) warrants to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock, $0.01 par value, of the Corporation ("Class A Common Stock"), in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "New Warrants").

         WHEREAS, the Corporation shall use the proceeds, if any, from each
Closing for general working capital purposes.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, and
in consideration of the representations, warranties, and covenants contained
herein, the Corporation and the Purchasers hereby agree as set forth below.

                                   ARTICLE I

                        FILING; ISSUANCE AND RESERVATION;
                             SALE OF THE SECURITIES

1.1      FILING OF AMENDMENTS TO FUNDAMENTAL DOCUMENTS.

         Immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Corporation shall have filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (a) a Certificate of Amendment with respect to the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Certificate of Amendment to COI"); and (b) a Certificate of Amendment with
respect to the Certificate of Designations, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the "Certificate of Amendment to COD").

1.2      AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUANCE AND SALE OF SECURITIES AND RESERVATION OF
SHARES.

         Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Corporation has
authorized (a) the issuance and sale to the Purchasers of an aggregate amount of
up to 6,669,734 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Maximum Shortfall Share
Amount"); (b) the issuance to the Purchasers of
<PAGE>
the New Warrants; (c) the reservation of 6,669,734 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock for issuance upon the Closings; and (d) the reservation of 8,362,157
shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance upon (i) conversion of the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock, if any, to be issued hereunder and (ii) the exercise
of the New Warrants ((i) and (ii), collectively, the "Reserved Shares").

1.3      DELIVERY OF PREEMPTIVE NOTICES TO OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.

         Promptly following the date hereof, the Corporation shall deliver the
Preemptive Notice to each of its stockholders (other than LPA Investment) (each,
an "Other Stockholder"). Each Other Stockholder shall have until twenty days
from the delivery thereof (such date, the "Preemptive Rights Expiration Date")
to exercise its respective preemptive rights described therein in accordance
with the terms of the Preemptive Notice. Each Other Shareholder exercising its
respective preemptive rights in accordance with the terms of the Preemptive
Notice shall be designated an "Other Purchaser."

1.4      COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK.

         (a) Subject only to the terms and conditions hereof, each Purchaser
hereby commits, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to its respective
Proportional Percentage of the Maximum Shortfall Share Amount (with respect to
each Purchaser, such Purchaser's "Maximum Share Amount"). If a Shortfall exists
on the last day of the applicable Period, the Corporation shall as soon as
practicable following the completion of its financial statements for the
applicable Period, but in no event later than five Business Days prior to the
applicable Settlement Date, notify each Purchaser of the Shortfall which existed
during the applicable Period and the number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock required to be issued by the Corporation and purchased by the Purchasers
on the applicable Settlement Date (the aggregate shares of Series B Preferred
Stock to be purchased on such Settlement Date, the "Shortfall Shares"). On each
Settlement Date on which Shortfall Shares are required to be issued and
purchased, the Corporation shall issue to each Purchaser, and each Purchaser
shall purchase from the Corporation, such Purchaser's Proportional Percentage of
Shortfall Shares. The number of Shortfall Shares to be issued by the Corporation
and collectively purchased by the Purchasers on a particular Settlement Date
shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Shortfall, if any, on the
last day of the most recently ended Period by (y) 2.174. If the foregoing
calculation results in negative number, no Purchaser shall be required to
purchase Shortfall Shares with respect to such Period.

         (b) Upon no less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the
Corporation and the Purchasers (the "Advance Purchase Notice"), the Requisite
Purchasers may from time to time require the Corporation to issue and sell to
each Purchaser, and each Purchaser to purchase from the Corporation, shares of
Series B Preferred Stock in advance of any Settlement Date (the "Advance
Purchase Shares"). On the date set forth in the Advance Purchase Notice, the
Corporation shall issue and sell to each Purchaser, and each Purchaser shall
purchase from the Corporation, its Proportional Percentage of the aggregate
Advance Purchase Shares set forth in the Advance Purchase Notice.

                                       2
<PAGE>
         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at no
time shall any Purchaser be required to purchase any Shortfall Shares or Advance
Purchase Shares hereunder in excess of such Purchaser's Maximum Share Amount
less the aggregate number of Shortfall Shares and Advance Purchase Shares, if
any, previously purchased by such Purchaser hereunder.

         (d) As used in this Section 1.4, the following terms have the meanings
below:

                  "Period" means the Corporation's fiscal quarter ending nearest
to March 31, 2003 and each fiscal quarter ending thereafter until May 11, 2006.

                  "Proportional Percentage" means (a) with respect to any Other
Purchaser, the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of shares of Series
B Preferred Stock which such Other Purchaser commits to purchase pursuant to the
terms of the Preemptive Notice executed by such Other Purchaser (which shall not
be greater than such Other Purchaser's Common Stock Percentage (as defined in
the Stockholders Agreement) as of the date hereof) by (y) the Maximum Shortfall
Share Amount; and (b) with respect to LPA Investment 100% less the aggregate of
the Other Purchasers' Proportional Percentages as calculated in the immediately
preceding clause (a). In the event that a Purchaser is required to purchase
Shortfall Shares or Advance Purchase Shares and such Purchaser (a "Defaulting
Purchaser") fails to purchase its respective Proportional Percentage of such
Shortfall Shares or Advance Purchase Shares at the applicable Closing, the
Proportional Percentage of each other Purchaser shall be increased by the amount
of such Defaulting Purchaser's Proportional Percentage multiplied by a fraction
equal to (x) the amount of such other Purchasers' Proportional Percentage,
divided by (y) the aggregate Proportionate Percentage of all Purchasers who are
not Defaulting Purchasers.

                  "Settlement Date" means, with respect to each Period, the date
that is ten Business Days following the date that the Corporation is required to
deliver to the Lenders the financial information described in Sections 5.01(a)
or (b), as applicable, of the Credit Agreement. If the Lenders extend the
deadline for delivery of such financial information at any time, the Settlement
Date for such Period shall be similarly extended for an equal amount of time.

                  "Shortfall" means, to the extent that the Corporation was not
in compliance with Section 6.14 of the Credit Agreement as of the last day of
the applicable Period, the amount which if added to Consolidated EBITDAR for
such Period would have satisfied the covenant set forth in Section 6.14 as of
the last day of such Period.

1.5      ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS.

         (a) In consideration of the obligations of each Purchaser hereunder
(including each Purchaser's obligation to purchase Shortfall Shares and Advance
Purchase Shares pursuant to Section 1.4) the Corporation shall issue and deliver
to each Purchaser a number of New Warrants equal to the product of (x) the New
Warrant Number and (y) such Purchaser's Proportional Percentage.

         (b) All New Warrants issued hereunder shall be issued free and clear of
any liens, claims, charges and encumbrances whatsoever and with no restrictions
on the voting rights of any securities to be issued upon exercise thereof (in
each case other than pursuant to the

                                       3
<PAGE>
Transaction Documents and the Related Documents) or any other incidents of
record and beneficial ownership pertaining thereto.

1.6      ISSUANCE OF SHORTFALL SHARES, ADVANCE PURCHASE SHARES AND CONVERSION
SHARES.

         (a) All Shortfall Shares and Advance Purchase Shares issued at each
Closing, and all Conversion Shares when issued, shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and shall be issued (i) free and clear of any liens,
claims, charges and encumbrances whatsoever and with no restrictions on the
voting rights thereof (in each case other than pursuant to the Transaction
Documents and the Related Documents) or any other incidents of record and
beneficial ownership pertaining thereto and (ii) against receipt by the
Corporation from such Purchaser of an amount of immediately available funds
equal to the product of (x) $2.174 and (y) the number of Shortfall Shares or
Advance Purchase Shares, as applicable, being purchased by such Purchaser at
such Closing.

         (b) Any payments made by any Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1.6
shall be to an account designated by the Corporation prior to the applicable
Closing.

1.7      CLOSING PRIOR TO THE PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS EXPIRATION DATE.

         If any Shortfall Shares or Advance Purchase Shares are required to be
issued prior to the Preemptive Rights Expiration Date and any Other Stockholder
who is not an "Other Purchaser" prior to the date of Closing of such issuance
subsequently becomes an "Other Purchaser" hereunder, the number of Series B
Preferred Stock (whether Shortfall Shares, Advance Purchase Shares or both) to
be purchased by each Purchaser at the first Closing after the Preemptive Rights
Expiration Date (the "Post Preemptive Rights Expiration Date Closing") shall be
calculated so that following the Post Preemptive Rights Expiration Date Closing
each Purchaser shall have purchased its respective Proportional Percentage
(calculated immediately following the Post Preemptive Rights Expiration Date
Closing) of all Series B Preferred Stock issued hereunder as of such date. The
Corporation shall, in good faith, calculate the number of Series B Preferred
Stock to be purchased by each Purchaser at the Post Preemptive Rights Expiration
Date Closing pursuant to the foregoing.

1.8      TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.

         The obligations of each Purchaser hereunder shall automatically
terminate without further action from any party hereto on the earlier of (a) the
date such Purchaser purchases an aggregate amount of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock hereunder equal to its Maximum Share Amount; (b) the date the
obligations (other than contingent obligations and liabilities) of the
Corporation under the Credit Agreement are terminated; and (c) such other time
that the Lenders agree in writing to release the Purchasers from their
respective obligations hereunder.

2.2      DEFAULTING PURCHASERS.

                  (a) In the event that a Defaulting Purchaser fails to purchase

         by such Defaulting Purchaser in the same proportion as the other
         holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively,
         vote such shares and hereby grants an irrevocable proxy to the
         Corporation to vote such shares in such manner at any meeting of
         stockholders or by any action by written consent of stockholders (it

         interest);

                           (ii) the Defaulting Purchaser shall forfeit all New
         Warrants held by such Defaulting Purchaser and/or the securities issued
         or issuable upon the exercise thereof;

         shares of Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of
         the Series B Preferred Stock held by such Defaulting Purchaser to the
         extent that such shares have been issued as a result of the
         anti-dilution provisions set forth in Section 6(d) of the Certificate
         of Designations;

                           (iv) the Defaulting Purchaser, automatically at the
         election of the Corporation (as indicated in the Default Notice) shall
         either (A) forfeit all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon

         or (B) convert all shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such
         Defaulting Purchaser into shares of Class A Common Stock; and/or

                           (v) the Defaulting Purchaser shall forfeit the right
         to receive any amounts in respect of each share of Series B Preferred

         excess of $2.174.

                  (b) If the Corporation elects to exercise any of its rights
under Section 2.2(a), it shall deliver a written notice (the "Default Notice")
to the Defaulting Purchaser within 120 days after the date of the applicable
Closing, which shall specify which of the foregoing remedies the Corporation
elects to exercise. Upon delivery of the Default Notice, the Corporation shall
be authorized to cancel on its books the New Warrants, stock certificates(s) or
other documents or instruments representing any securities forfeited pursuant to
Section 2.2(a), record on its books the conversion of any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and/or vote any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock pursuant to the proxy granted pursuant to
Section 2.2(a). Each Purchaser (including all Defaulting Purchasers) hereby
agrees

                                       6
<PAGE>
to take all actions requested by the Corporation to give effect to the
provisions of Section 2.2(a), including, but not limited to, executing any
documents or instruments and approving amendments to the Fundamental Documents
of the Corporation.

                  (c) Without the requirement to deliver a Default Notice, no
Defaulting Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any future Closing
and, if notified by the Corporation from time to time, such Defaulting
Purchaser's Proportional Percentage shall equal zero.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if none of the Other Stockholders execute and deliver this Agreement
prior to the Preemptive Rights Expiration Date, Sections 2.2(a), 2.2(b), and
2.2(c) shall be null and void and without effect.

                  (e) If the Corporation fails to take any action to enforce the
obligations of the Purchasers set forth in Section 1.4 within 10 days after the
date that such obligations are due, the Administrative Agent under the Credit
Agreement (acting for the Lenders under the Credit Agreement) shall have the
right to enforce, on behalf of and for the sole benefit of the Corporation, any
rights the Corporation may have against the Purchasers for failure to satisfy
such obligations. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Corporation in
writing 10 days prior to undertaking any action hereunder.

Shortfall Shares, the Advance Purchase Shares, and the Conversion Shares, such
Securities will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof, free and clear of
any Liens whatsoever and with no restrictions on the voting rights thereof and
other incidents of record and beneficial ownership pertaining thereto, in each
case other than pursuant to the Transaction Documents and the Related Documents.

3.3      NON-CONTRAVENTION.

         The execution, delivery and performance by the Corporation of the
Transaction Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
and compliance with the provisions thereof, including the issuance, sale and
delivery of the Shortfall Shares, the Advance Purchase Shares and the New
Warrants, have not and shall not, and the issuance and delivery of the
Conversion Shares shall not, (a) violate any Law to which the Corporation, its

Shortfall Shares, the Advance Purchase Shares, the New Warrants or any other
Transaction Documents, for the valid authorization, issuance and delivery of the
Conversion Shares, or the valid authorization and reservation of the Reserved

jointly, represents and warrants to the Corporation as set forth below:

4.1      POWER AND AUTHORITY.

         Such Purchaser has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement. The execution and delivery by such Purchaser of this Agreement and
the performance of the obligations of such Purchaser contained herein have been
duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of such Purchaser. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Purchaser and constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser, enforceable against
such Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights and subject to
general principles of equity.

4.2      NO CONFLICT.

         The execution and delivery by such Purchaser of this Agreement, such
Purchaser's consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and such
Purchaser's compliance with the provisions hereof, will not (i) violate any
provision of any document or other instrument governing its creation or
operation, including any amendments thereto, (ii) violate, conflict with or
constitute (with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration, under, or result in
the creation of any encumbrance upon such Purchaser's properties or assets
pursuant to, the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, lease,
mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which such Purchaser is a party or by which such Purchaser or any of such

<PAGE>
4.3      NO CONSENT OR APPROVAL REQUIRED.

         No permit, authorization, consent or approval of or by, or notification
of or filing with, any Person is required to be made or obtained by such
Purchaser in connection with such Purchaser's valid authorization, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, other than those permits,
authorizations, consents, approvals, notifications or filings that have been or
will timely be obtained or made, as the case may be.

4.4      INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.

                  (a) Such Purchaser, either individually or in conjunction with
its Purchaser Representative (as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act), has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he or it is
capable of utilizing the information made available to such Purchaser, to
evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Corporation and to make an
informed investment decision with respect thereto. Such Purchaser is aware that
the investment in the Securities is highly speculative. Such Purchaser is able,
without impairing such Purchaser's financial condition, to hold the Securities
for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of his, her or
its investment.

                  (b) Such Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the
offering of the Securities has not been considered or approved by any
governmental or other entity.

                  (c) Such Purchaser recognizes that an investment in the
Corporation involves certain risks, and has taken full cognizance of the risk
factors related to the Securities. Such Purchaser has had the opportunity to
consult with his, her or its professional, tax and legal advisors with respect
to the federal, state, local and foreign income tax consequences of such
Purchaser's participation as a holder of the Securities.

                  (d) Such Purchaser understands that there is no public market
for the Securities and that the transferability of the Securities is restricted.
Such Purchaser will not transfer the Securities acquired by him, her or it
hereunder, except in compliance with this Agreement.

                  (e) The Securities issued to such Purchaser were issued for
such Purchaser's own account, for investment purposes only and were not acquired
with a view towards resale or further distribution. Such Purchaser understands
that the Securities have not been registered for sale under the Securities Act
or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities Laws and that
the Securities issued to such Purchaser cannot be offered for sale or sold by
such Purchaser or anyone acting for such Purchaser's account or on such
Purchaser's behalf without the registration of the Securities, as applicable,
and/or the fulfillment of other regulatory requirements.

                  (f) Such Purchaser further understands that, with respect to
the Securities, the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 144 (the
provisions of which are known to such Purchaser) promulgated under the
Securities Act depends on the satisfaction of various conditions, and that, if
applicable, Rule 144 may only afford the basis for sales of such Purchaser's
Securities only in limited amounts.

                                       11
<PAGE>
                  (g) Neither such Purchaser nor any of its officers, directors
or employees (or any Affiliate of the foregoing) has employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders'
fees in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and such Purchaser
will not have any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (h) Such Purchaser acknowledges that it has had the
opportunity to review and discuss this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the Related Documents with their respective legal and financial
counsel.

                  (i) Such Purchaser further understands that the Corporation is
entering into this Agreement with such Purchaser in reliance upon such
Purchaser's representations to the Corporation contained in this Section 4.4.

5.1      COVENANTS OF THE CORPORATION.

         The Corporation hereby agrees that LPA Investment may rely on the

executed on the date hereof.

5.2      CONSENTS OF EACH PURCHASER.

                  (a) Each Purchaser hereby agrees to and does consent, in its
capacity as a holder of Common Stock and/or a holder of Preferred Stock, as
applicable, to the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to COI and Certificate
of Amendment to COD with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

                  (b) LPA Investment hereby waives the notice provisions

terms, they are no longer operative.

5.4      INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) In addition to all rights and remedies available to the
Purchasers at law or in equity, the Corporation shall indemnify the Purchasers
and, to the extent any Purchaser expressly agrees in writing with a transferee
who acquires the Shortfall Shares, the Advance Purchase Shares the New Warrants
or Conversion Shares from such Purchaser, such transferee and each of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives,

                                       12
<PAGE>
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") and
save and hold each of them harmless against and pay on behalf of or reimburse
such party as and when incurred for any loss (including, without limitation,
diminutions in value), liability, demand, claim, action, cause of action, cost,
damage, deficiency, tax, penalty, fine or expense, whether or not arising out of
any claims by or on behalf of any third party, including interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing (collectively,
"Losses") which any such party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a
result of, in connection with, relating or incidental to or by virtue of:

                           (i) any misrepresentation or breach of a
         representation or warranty on the part of the Corporation under Article
         III;

                           (ii) without duplication of Section 5.4(a)(i), any
         misrepresentation in or omission from any of the representations or
         warranties contained in the Transaction Documents, or any of the
         Exhibits and Schedules attached thereto, or any of the certificates or
         other documents furnished to a Purchaser by the Corporation and
         contemplated by the Transaction Documents;

                           (iii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or
         agreement on the part of the Corporation under the Transaction
         Documents; or

                           (iv) any claim (whenever made) resulting from or
         caused by any transaction, status, event, condition, occurrence or
         situation relating to, arising out of or in connection with (A) the
         status of, or conduct of the business and affairs of, the Corporation
         and its Subsidiaries, (B) the execution, delivery and performance of
         this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the related
         documents and agreements contemplated hereby and thereby or (C) any
         actions taken by or omitted to be taken by any of the Indemnified
         Parties in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
         Documents or the related documents and agreements contemplated hereby
         and thereby.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon judicial
determination, which is final and no longer appealable, that the act or omission
giving rise to the indemnification pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(iv) resulted
primarily out of or was based primarily upon the Indemnified Party's gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct (unless such action was based upon the
Indemnified Party's reliance in good faith upon any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or promises made by the Corporation herein) by the
Indemnified Party, the Corporation shall not be responsible for any Losses
sought to be indemnified in connection therewith, and the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover from the Indemnified Party all amounts previously paid in
full or partial satisfaction of such indemnity, together with all costs and
expenses of the Corporation reasonably incurred in effecting such recovery, if
any.

                  (c) All indemnification rights hereunder shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and therein indefinitely, regardless of any
investigation, inquiry or examination made for or on

                                       13
<PAGE>
behalf of, or any knowledge of such Purchaser and/or any of the other
Indemnified Parties or the acceptance by such Purchaser of any certificate or
opinion.

                  (d) If for any reason the indemnity provided for in this
Section 5.4 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold
each such Indemnified Party harmless from all such Losses arising with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the Documents, then the Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall each contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits received by the Corporation on the one hand and such Indemnified Party
on the other but also the relative fault of the Corporation and the Indemnified
Party as well as any relevant equitable considerations. In addition, the
Corporation agrees to reimburse any Indemnified Party upon demand for all
reasonable expenses (including legal counsel fees) incurred by such Indemnified
Party or any such other person in connection with investigating, preparing or
defending any such action or claim. The indemnity, contribution and expense
reimbursement obligations that the Corporation has under this Section 5.4 shall
be in addition to any liability that the Corporation may otherwise have. The
Corporation further agrees that the indemnification and reimbursement
commitments set forth in this Agreement shall apply whether or not the
Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such lawsuits, claims or other
proceedings.

                  (e) Any indemnification of the Purchaser or any other
Indemnified Party by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Corporation to
an account designated by the Purchaser or such other Indemnified Party within
fifteen days after the determination thereof.

                  (f) By executing this Agreement, the Corporation (a) agrees
that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability to the Corporation or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (the "Covered Conduct") except to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final
judgment, no longer subject to appeal, that the losses resulting from such
Covered Conduct primarily resulted from such Indemnified Party's willful
misconduct, fraud or gross negligence, (b) agrees that it will not make under
any circumstances, nor will it allow its Subsidiaries to make under any
circumstances, any claim against any Indemnified Party for any special, indirect
or consequential damages in respect of any breach or wrongful conduct (whether
the claim therefore is based on contract, tort or duty imposed by law) in
connection with, arising out of or in any way related to, the transactions
contemplated by and the relationship established by this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the Related Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, and (c) waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon, and it agrees to
cause its Subsidiaries not to sue upon, any such claim for any such damages,
whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in any
such party's favor.

                  (g) Without the requirement to deliver a Default Notice, this
Section 5.4 shall not apply to any Defaulting Purchaser.

6.2      RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS.

                  (a) Each certificate for the Securities shall (unless
otherwise provided by the provisions of Section 6.4 but subject to Section
6.2(c)) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following terms:

                  "THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF HAS REPRESENTED
                  TO THE ISSUER OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY
                  THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED SUCH SECURITIES FOR
                  INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.
                  ACCORDINGLY, SUCH SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
                  REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
                  AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR BLUE SKY
                  LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED
                  OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS SUBSEQUENTLY REGISTERED
                  THEREUNDER OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
                  THEREUNDER IS AVAILABLE.

                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
                  ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE SECURITIES
                  PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED FEBRUARY 10, 2003, AS
                  AMENDED, MODIFIED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO
                  TIME, AMONG THE ISSUER (THE "CORPORATION") AND
                  THE OTHER PARTIES THERETO. THE TERMS OF SUCH
                  AGREEMENT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER OBLIGATIONS,
                  EQUITY COMMITMENT OBLIGATIONS. FAILURE TO
                  SATISFY SUCH OBLIGATIONS COULD SUBJECT THE
                  HOLDER OF SUCH SECURITIES TO CERTAIN NEGATIVE
                  EVENTS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN SUCH AGREEMENT.
                  COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED TO
                  THE HOLDER HEREOF WITHOUT CHARGE UPON WRITTEN
                  REQUEST OF THE CORPORATION."

                  (b) In addition to the above, any Conversion Shares issued by
the Corporation shall be subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement,
including, without limitation, the legend requirements set forth in Section 7.5
thereof.

<PAGE>
                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 6.3, the second legend set forth in Section 6.2(a) shall be printed on
all Securities only until such time as the obligations of the Purchasers in
Sections 2.2 are no longer in effect.

6.3      NOTICE OF TRANSFER.

         The holder of any Securities, by its acceptance or purchase thereof,
agrees, prior to any Transfer of any such Securities (except pursuant to an
effective registration statement), to give written notice to the Corporation of
such holder's intention to effect such transfer and agrees to comply in all
other respects with the provisions of this Article VI. Each such notice shall
describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed Transfer and, unless
waived by the Corporation, shall be accompanied by the written opinion,
addressed to the Corporation, of counsel for the holder of such Securities
(which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation), stating
that in the opinion of such counsel (which opinion shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation) such proposed Transfer does not involve a
transaction requiring registration or qualification of such Securities under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States. Subject
to complying with the other applicable provisions hereof, such holder of
Securities shall be entitled to consummate such Transfer in accordance with the
terms of the notice delivered by it to the Corporation if the Corporation does
not object (on the basis that such transfer violates the provisions of this
Article VI) to such transfer within five days after the delivery of such notice.
Each certificate or other instrument evidencing the securities issued upon the
transfer of any Securities (and each certificate or other instrument evidencing
any untransferred balance of such securities) shall bear the legend set forth in
Section 6.2 unless (a) in such opinion of such counsel registration of future
transfer is not required by the applicable provisions of the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state of the United States or (b) the Corporation
shall have waived the requirement of such legend.

6.4      REMOVAL OF LEGENDS, ETC.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VI, the
restrictions imposed by Sections 6.1, 6.2(a), and 6.3 upon the transferability
of any Securities shall cease and terminate when (a) any such Securities are
sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the intended method of
disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in a registration
statement or are sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction contemplated by
Section 6.3 which does not require that the securities transferred bear the
legend set forth in Section 6.2(a), or (b) the holder of such Securities has met
the requirement of transfer of such Securities pursuant to subparagraph (k) of
Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Whenever the restrictions imposed by Sections
6.1, 6.2(a) and 6.3 shall terminate, as herein provided, the holder of any
Securities shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation, without expense, a
new certificate not bearing the restrictive legend set forth in Section 6.2(a)
and not containing any other reference to the restrictions imposed by Sections
6.1, 6.2(a) and 6.3.

7.11     CONSTRUCTION.

         Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general
statement contained herein, such specific language shall not be deemed to
modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the general
statement to which it relates. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.

7.12     INTERPRETATION.

         Accounting terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings given to them under GAAP. As used in this Agreement (including all
Schedules, Exhibits, Annexes and amendments hereto), the masculine, feminine and
neuter gender and the singular or plural number shall be deemed to include the
others whenever the context so requires. References to Articles and Sections
refer to articles and sections of this Agreement. Similarly, references to
Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes refer to schedules, exhibits and annexes,
respectively, attached to this Agreement. Unless the content requires otherwise,
words such as "hereby," "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," "hereto," "hereunder"
and words of like import refer to this Agreement. The article and section
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

7.13     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a

fact that such action or condition is permitted by another covenant shall not
affect the occurrence of such default, unless expressly permitted under an
exception to such initial covenant. In addition, all representations and
warranties hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular
representation or warranty proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that
another representation or warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter

of a representation and warranty hereunder.

7.14     REMEDIES.

         The parties hereto shall each have and retain all other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at Law or equity, including, without
limitation, any actions for specific performance and/or injunctive or other

enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation hereby agrees that in
the event the Corporation fails to convey any number of Securities to any
Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, such Purchaser's
remedy at law may be inadequate. In such event, such Purchaser shall have the
right, in addition to all other rights and remedies it may have, to specific
performance of the obligations of the Corporation to convey such number of
Securities.

7.15     SEVERABILITY.

         It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions
of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws
and public policies applied in each

                                       24
<PAGE>
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular
provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such
provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating
the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such
provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement
or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

7.16     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

         EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT.

         SECTION 2.  EXERCISE OF WARRANT.

                  (a) On and after the Effective Date and until 5:00 p.m. in New
York City on the Expiration Date, the Holder may exercise this Warrant, on one
or more occasions, on any Business Day, in whole or in part, by delivering to
the Issuer, at its office maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 5(a)
hereof:

                           (i) a written notice of the Holder's election to
         exercise this Warrant, which notice shall be substantially in the form
         of Exhibit A attached hereto and shall be properly completed (the
         "Exercise Notice"),

                           (ii) payment of the Exercise Price (payable as set
         forth in Section 2(b) below) for the Warrant Stock as to which this
         Warrant is being exercised, and

                           (iii) this Warrant.

         Except to the extent necessary to cause the number of shares of Class A
         Common Stock deliverable as provided in Section 2(b) to be a whole
         number of shares, this Warrant shall be exercisable in part only for a
         whole number of shares.

                  (b) At the option of the Holder, the Exercise Price shall be
payable

                           (i) in cash or by certified or official bank check
         payable to the order of the Issuer; or

                                      A-4
<PAGE>
                           (ii) by delivery of this Warrant to the Issuer for
         cancellation in accordance with the further provisions of this Section
         2(b).

In exchange for the portion of this Warrant that is being exercised at such
time, the Holder shall receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock for
which this Warrant is being exercised at such time by (B) a fraction, (1) the
numerator of which shall be the difference between (x) Current Market Price per
share of Class A Common Stock at such time and (y) the Exercise Price per share
of Class A Common Stock, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the Current
Market Price per share of Class A Common Stock at such time. The Issuer shall
issue a new Warrant for the portion, if any, of this Warrant not being exercised
as provided in Section 2(f).

                  (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2(d), upon receipt of
an Exercise Notice, the aggregate Exercise Price payable and this Warrant, the
Issuer shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter, issue one or more stock certificates representing the
aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock to which the Holder is
entitled and transfer to the Holder of this Warrant appropriate evidence of
ownership of other securities or property (including any cash) to which the
Holder is entitled, in such denominations, and registered or otherwise placed
in, or payable to the order of, such name or names, as may be directed in
writing by the Holder, and shall deliver such stock certificates, evidence of
ownership and any other securities or property (including any cash) to the
person or persons entitled to receive the same, together with an amount in cash
in lieu of any fraction of a share (or fractional interest in any other
security), as hereinafter provided. The Issuer shall pay all expenses in
connection with, and any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer
taxes of the United States or any state thereof payable in respect of, the issue
or delivery of the Warrant Stock upon exercise of this Warrant. However, the
Issuer shall not be required to pay any tax or other charge imposed in
connection with any assignment or transfer involved in the issue of any
certificate or other evidence of ownership of Warrant Stock.

                  (d) The Holder's election to exercise this Warrant may, in the
sole discretion of the Holder, be conditioned upon, and in such event, the
exercise shall be subject in all respects to, the consummation of a sale of the
Issuer, the public offering of any class of the Issuer's Common Stock registered
under the Securities Act or other similar transaction involving the Issuer, as
specified in the Exercise Notice. If any exercise of this Warrant is so
conditioned, then, subject to delivery of the items required by Section 2(c),
the Issuer shall deliver the certificates and other evidence of ownership of
other securities or other property in such manner as the Holder shall direct as
required in connection with the consummation of the transaction upon which the
exercise is conditioned. At any time that the Holder shall give notice to the
Issuer that such transaction has been abandoned or the Holder has withdrawn from
participation in such transaction, the Issuer shall return the items delivered
pursuant to Section 2(c) and the Holder's election to exercise this Warrant
shall be deemed rescinded.

                  (e) The stock certificate or certificates or other evidence of
ownership of Warrant Stock to be delivered pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued, and the Holder or any other Person so designated
to be named therein shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed to have
become a holder of record of the Warrant Stock represented thereby, including
having the right to vote any voting securities included therein or to consent or
to

                                      A-5
<PAGE>
receive notice as a shareholder, as of the date on which the last of the
Exercise Notice, payment of the Exercise Price and this Warrant is received by
the Issuer as aforesaid, (subject, in the case of any exercise to which Section
2(d) applies, to the consummation of the transaction upon which such exercise is
conditioned) notwithstanding that the transfer books of the Company shall then
be closed or that such certificates or other evidence of ownership shall not
then actually have been delivered to the Holder.

                  (f) If this Warrant shall have been exercised only in part,
the Issuer shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates or
other evidence of ownership of Warrant Stock, execute and deliver to the Holder,
without charge, a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase
the unpurchased Warrant Stock called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant
shall in all other respects be identical to this Warrant, except for any legend
hereon to the extent no longer required pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement.

                  (g) The Issuer shall not be required to issue any fractional
share of Class A Common Stock (or fractional interest in any other security)
upon exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share (or fractional
interest in any other security) that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive upon such exercise, the Issuer shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of
such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Current Market
Price per share of Class A Common Stock (and/or other security) on the date of
exercise; provided, however, that in the event that the Issuer undertakes a
reduction in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or other securities
outstanding, it shall be required to issue fractional shares or fractional
interests in such other securities to the Holder if the Holder exercises all
(but not part) of this Warrant, unless the Holder shall have consented in
writing to such reduction and provided the Issuer with a written waiver of its
right to receive fractional shares or interests in accordance with this
paragraph. If the Holder shall exercise more than one Warrant in the same
transaction, any payment in respect of fractional shares (or other fractional
interests) shall be based on the final fraction resulting from aggregating all
such exercises.

                  (h) The Issuer hereby agrees at all times to keep reserved for
issuance and delivery upon exercise of this Warrant such number of its
authorized but unissued shares (or treasury shares) of Class A Common Stock or
other securities of the Issuer from time to time issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant as will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of this Warrant.
All such shares and other securities shall be duly authorized and, when issued
upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens,
security interests, charges and other encumbrances or restrictions on sale
(except to the extent of any applicable provisions set forth in the Purchase
Agreement or Stockholders' Agreement) and free and clear of all preemptive or
similar rights.

                  (i) If the issuance of any shares of Class A Common Stock or
other securities required to be reserved for purposes of the exercise of this
Warrant requires the registration with, or approval of, any governmental
authority or requires listing on any national securities exchange or national
market system before such shares or other securities may be so issued, the
Issuer shall at its expense use its best efforts to cause such shares to be duly
registered, approved or listed, as the case may be, so that such shares or other
securities may be issued in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however,
that this provision shall not obligate the Issuer to register such

                                      A-6
<PAGE>
shares or other securities under the Securities Act or qualify them under state
securities or blue sky laws.

         SECTION 3.  TRANSFER, DIVISION AND COMBINATION.

                  (a) This Warrant may not be Transferred other than in
accordance with Section 6.3 of the Purchase Agreement.

                  (b) This Warrant may be exchanged for, or combined with, other
Warrants upon presentation of this Warrant and any other Warrants with which
this Warrant is to be combined to the Issuer, together with a written notice
specifying the denominations in which a new Warrant or Warrants are to be
issued, signed by the Holder. The Issuer shall execute and deliver a new Warrant
or Warrants to the Holder in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice.

                  (c) The Issuer shall maintain books for the registration and
transfer of the Warrants, and shall allow each Warrant Holder to inspect such
books at such reasonable times as such holder shall request.

         SECTION 4.  ADJUSTMENTS.

                  (a) Dividends and Distributions. If at any time the Issuer
shall pay any dividend or make any other distribution to holders of its Class A
Common Stock of any cash, evidence of indebtedness or other property (including
any rights or warrants to purchase any securities of the Issuer) of any nature
whatsoever (other than as contemplated by Section 4(b), the Issuer shall at the
same time pay or distribute to the Holder (whether or not the Holder exercises
this Warrant) the cash, evidence of indebtedness or other property the Holder
would have been entitled to receive if such Holder had exercised this Warrant
immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution.

                  (b) Subdivisions and Combinations. If at any time the Issuer
shall

                           (i) take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
         for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other
         distribution of Common Stock;

                           (ii) subdivide, split or reclassify its outstanding
         shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares of Common Stock;
         or

                           (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock
         into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock;

then immediately after the occurrence of any such event (A) the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted
so as to equal the number of shares of Class A Common Stock the Holder would
have held immediately after the occurrence of such event (in the case of an
event referred to in clause (i), after giving effect to such dividend or
distribution) if the Holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior to the
occurrence of such event and (B) the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to be
equal to (x) the Exercise Price immediately prior to the occurrence of such
event multiplied by (y) a fraction (1)

                                      A-7
<PAGE>
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to the adjustment in clause (A)
and (2) the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately after the adjustment in
clause (A).

                  (c) Merger, Consolidation or Disposition of Assets. If the
Issuer shall merge, consolidate or effect a share exchange with another entity,
or shall sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
assets to another entity and pursuant to the terms of such merger,
consolidation, share exchange or disposition of assets, cash, shares of common
stock or other securities of the successor or acquiring entity, or property of
any nature is to be received by or distributed to the holders of Common Stock,
then the Holder shall be entitled to receive in respect of the Warrant Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the amount of cash, shares of common
stock, other securities or other property that it would have been entitled to
receive if such Holder had exercised this Warrant in full immediately prior to
the occurrence of such merger, consolidation, share exchange or disposition of
assets. In the case of any such merger, consolidation, share exchange or
disposition of assets, the successor or acquiring entity (and any Affiliate
thereof issuing securities) shall expressly assume the due and punctual
observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this
Warrant to be performed and observed by the Issuer and all of the obligations
and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed
appropriate (as determined by resolution of the Board and reasonably acceptable
to the Majority Holders) in order to provide for adjustments of the Warrant
Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant that shall be as nearly equivalent
as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4. The foregoing
provisions shall similarly apply to successive mergers, consolidations, share
exchanges and dispositions of assets.

                  (d) Capital Reorganization or Capital Reclassification. If the
Issuer shall effect any capital reorganization or any reclassification of its
capital stock (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par
value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a stock dividend or
subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), then in each case the Issuer
shall cause effective provision to be made so that this Warrant shall be
exercisable for the kind and number of shares of stock, other securities, cash
or other property to which a holder of the Warrant Stock deliverable upon
exercise of this Warrant would have been entitled upon such reorganization or
reclassification and any such provision shall include adjustments in respect of
such stock, securities or other property that shall be as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4 with
respect to this Warrant.

                  (e) Other Action Affecting Common Stock. If at any time or
from time to time the Issuer shall take any action affecting its Common Stock,
other than any action described in this Section 4, then, unless such action will
not have an adverse effect upon the Holder's rights, the number of shares of
Warrant Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the Board shall in good
faith determine (such determination to be reasonably acceptable to the Majority
Holders) to be equitable in the circumstances, but no such adjustment shall
decrease the number of shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant or increase the Exercise Price.

                  (f) Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the number of shares of
Warrant Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted pursuant
to this Agreement, the Issuer

                                      A-8
<PAGE>
shall forthwith obtain a certificate signed by a firm of independent accountants
of recognized national standing selected by the Issuer setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the method by which such
adjustment was calculated and specifying the number of shares of Warrant Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant after giving effect to such adjustment.
The Issuer shall promptly cause a signed copy of such certificate to be
delivered to the Holder. The Issuer shall keep at its office maintained for
purposes of Section 5(a) hereof copies of all such certificates and cause the
same to be available for inspection at said office during normal business hours
by the Holder or any prospective purchaser of a Warrant designated by the
registered Holder hereof.

                  (g) No Impairment. The Issuer will not, by amendment of its
Fundamental Documents or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Issuer, but will at all
times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the exercise rights of the Holder against
impairment.

                  (h) Miscellaneous. The computations of all amounts under this
Section 4 shall be made assuming all other anti-dilution or similar adjustments
to be made to the terms of all other securities resulting from the transaction
causing an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4 have previously been made so as
to maintain the relative economic interest of this Warrant vis a vis all other
securities issued by the Issuer.

                  (i) Par Value. The Issuer shall take or cause to be taken such
steps as shall be necessary to ensure that the par value per share of Class A
Common Stock is at all times less than or equal to the Exercise Price.

                  (j) Minimum Adjustment of Exercise Price. No adjustment of the
Exercise Price shall be made in an amount of less than 10% of the Exercise Price
in effect at the time of such adjustment is otherwise required to be made, but
any such lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the
time and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any
adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to not less than 10% of such
Exercise Price; provided, however, that all carried forward adjustments shall be
made on the exercise of the Warrant.

         SECTION 5. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) Office of Issuer. So long as this Warrant remains
outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office in the continental United
States where the Warrants may be presented for exercise, transfer, division or
combination as provided in this Warrant. Such office shall be at 130 South
Jefferson, Chicago, Illinois 60661, unless and until the Issuer shall designate
and maintain some other office for such purposes and give notice thereof to the
Holder.

                  (b) Notices Generally. Any notices and other communications
pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be sent in accordance with the

                  (c) Governing Law. This Warrant shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to
its conflicts of laws rules. The Issuer agrees that it may be served with
process in the State of New York and any action for breach of this Warrant may
be prosecuted against it in the courts of such State or any Federal court
located in such State.

                  (d) Limitation of Liability. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other
rights of a shareholder of the Issuer, as a shareholder. No provision hereof, in
the absence of affirmative action by the Holder to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock, and no mere enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the
Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the Exercise Price or
as a shareholder of the Issuer, whether such liability is asserted by the
Issuer, by any creditor of the Issuer or any other Person.

                  (e) Loss or Destruction of Warrant. Upon receipt by the Issuer
of evidence satisfactory to it (in the exercise of its reasonable discretion) of
the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and (in the case of
loss, theft or destruction), if requested by the Issuer, of reasonably
satisfactory indemnification (if the Holder is a financial institution or an
Affiliate thereof, its own agreement being satisfactory), or (in the case of
mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Issuer shall,
without charge, execute and deliver a new Warrant exercisable for the same
amount of Warrant Stock.

                  (f) Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Warrant may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Issuer and the Majority Holders
(provided than no amendment that treats a particular Holder in a non-ratable,
discriminatory fashion shall be effective against such Holder without its
consent) and, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.
