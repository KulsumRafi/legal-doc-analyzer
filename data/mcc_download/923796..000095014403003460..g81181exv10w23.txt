                  computer operator is onsite from 06:30 to 24:00 Monday through
                  Friday and 00:00 to 08:00 on Sundays. During off-hours, the
                  Wackenhut Call Center can page the on-call staff member(s)

                  capabilities have been implemented in the data center that

                  Please note that the all major IT applications, including
                  Infinium, are not available to users on Sundays, from 00:00 to
                  12:00. System maintenance, modifications and upgrades are
                  performed during this weekly "change window".

         D.       NETWORK SERVICES

                  TWC will continue to provide both long distance voice
                  communications and Wide Area Network (WAN) data network
                  communications under the respective AT&T services contracts.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  The AT&T long distance voice contract expires January 1, 2003.
                  The value of WCC participating under a common long distance
                  contract is simply an optimal cost per minute as part of a
                  larger volume-based service. WCC intends to continue to
                  participate in a shared long distance contract. TWC is
                  currently negotiating a two-year extension with AT&T given the
                  unsettled dynamics associated with the telecommunications
                  industry (there is a fear the cost per minute could rise due
                  to reduced competition). WCC will participate in discussions
                  with TWC prior to and during negotiations of this contract.
                  WCC reserves the right to opt out of participating in any
                  common long distance contract up until contract signing.
                  Nothing in this agreement prevents WCC from negotiating a
                  separate agreement with the same or different contractor.

                  The AT&T WAN contracts (one for the data services and one for
                  management services) expire November 2003. TWC will continue
                  to provide WCC data network services to HQ and Field employees
                  to provide access to Infinium, email, operational applications
                  and the Internet.

                  Technically, the network links at the correctional and
                  hospital facilities will be redirected to the new WCC
                  Headquarters facility. Optionally, two high-speed, diverse
                  network links will be provided between the WCC and TWC
                  locations for authorized access to Infinium depending on the
                  location of the AS-400 and the location of the Essbase server.

                  From a security perspective, TWC will place and manage a
                  firewall at the WCC location to ensure only authorized network
                  traffic is routed to the TWC Infinium environment.

                  WCC will directly pay for the network links between their HQ
                  facility and the TWC Headquarter facility. In addition, WCC
                  will contract with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to gain
                  direct access to the Internet from their new HQ facility.

         E.       END USER TRAINING

                  The TWC IT department will provide quarterly classroom-style
                  training sessions on all applicable Infinium modules for WCC
                  personnel. Typically, the training sessions are three days in
                  length. Assuming that the new WCC Headquarters facility has an
                  adequate training classroom, the session will be held at the
                  WCC location. If training facilities are not available,
                  training will be held at the TWC Headquarters location.

                  WCC is responsible for all travel, lodging, and meal costs for
                  WCC field personnel who attend the quarterly training
                  sessions.

                  TWC will provide Infinium technical training to WCC IT
                  personnel for support of the Infinium system.

         F.       DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING (DRP)

                  TWC has a commercial contract with IBM for IT DRP services.
                  Specifically, TWC can restore all major business applications
                  at an IBM location in New Jersey in the event of a disaster.
                  In addition, the TWC IT department conducts a "dry-run" of the
                  DRP restoral process on an annual basis to best ensure the
                  staff is prepared to support TWC and WCC in the event of an
                  actual business disaster.

                  Please note two important elements of the DRP contract with
                  IBM:

                  o   There will be an incremental charge of $39,000 to WCC due
                      to the need for a second AS400. This charge will be in
                      addition to the $1.75mm annual service fee.

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  o   Systems based at the WCC correctional facilities (e.g.,
                      PDS, commissary system) are NOT covered under the TWC DRP
                      plan per previous direction from the WCC management team.
                      These systems could be covered under the DRP strategy if
                      desired at an incremental cost. Please note that a DRP
                      strategy for critical business systems will be a primary
                      element of any external audit of IT systems and processes.

                  o   If WCC elects to operate the server at its new
                      headquarters in Boca Raton Florida, it may elect to obtain
                      IT DRP services from an alternative provider.

         G.       TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED COSTS

                  WCC will build and implement fully functional Human Resources,
                  Payroll, Accounts Payable and Tax capabilities by January 1,
                  2003. These functional areas will continue to use the infinium
                  application supported and maintained by TWC. To securely
                  support this functional separation, a dedicated AS400 is
                  required to run a copy of Infinium/CCM for WCC. The one-time
                  capital / operating expense associated with the AS400 is
                  estimated at $810,000. WCC will be the owner of the new AS 400
                  and all associated data and software except for Infinium/CCM.
                  WCC will determine the operating location of the AS-400 and
                  Essbase server. Ongoing operating expenses are estimated at
                  $64,000 (excludes depreciation, software maintenance and
                  hardware maintenance). These costs will be directly paid by
                  WCC and are not part of the $1.75mm annual service charge.

                  In the event that the AS400 is moved from TWC Headquarters to
                  any other location, WCC will provide and will be responsible
                  for operational support to TWC in the following areas: Backup
                  and recovery, offsite date storage, and other support as
                  necessary.

                  If WCC elects to select new service providers (e.g., banking
                  partner, medical insurer, 401K/retirement) and electronic
                  interfaces are required between Infinium and the third party
                  business partner, the development of the computer interfaces
                  will be charged to WCC on a time and materials basis. All work
                  will have proper authorization from the WCC management team
                  before any expense is incurred.

                  At some point, during the term of this agreement for IT
                  Services, WCC will begin the process of transitioning to its
                  own fully functional IT department. TWC will assist with this
                  process on a negotiated basis. Specifically, TWC may assist
                  with programming, data retrieval, etc.

         H.       OUT OF SCOPE SERVICES

               i.    Electronic Mail

                      common, Lotus Notes-based email solution for Security
                      Services, WCC and WRI, only Security Services fully
                      adopted this mail platform. There was a stated direction
                      for WCC to adopt Lotus Notes approximately six months ago,
                      but with the planned separation, WCC has elected to
                      implement their own email platform (Microsoft Exchange) no
                      later than January 1, 2003. The WCC technical support team
                      will implement and manage this email package.

               ii.   PC Service and Support

                      WCC will continue to provide help desk and technical
                      support for all PCs within their respective organization.
                      Whenever upgraded PC software is required to access
                      Infinium, TWC will provide a copy of the software via a CD
                      to the WCC staff for installation.

                                       7

               iii.  Local Area Network (LAN) Service and Support

                      WCC will continue to support all file and print services
                      as well as the physical infrastructure associated with
                      their LAN environments (e.g., wiring, Ethernet hubs).

               iv.   Corporate Headquarters Telephone System (PBX) Service and
                     Support

                      WCC will manage the PBX system in the new HQ facility.
                      This includes all moves, additions, and troubleshooting of
                      telephones and inside wiring.

               v.    REMOTE FACILITY APPLICATION SUPPORT

                      WCC will continue to have full responsibility and
                      accountability for all correctional and hospital-base
                      business applications. Key examples include PDS, their
                      inmate tracking system, and their commissary system.

               vi.   NEW PROJECTS PROCESS

                      If and when WCC elects engage the TWC IT staff for any new
                      project activity, a detailed proposal will be jointly
                      developed outlining overall project goals and objectives,
                      business benefits, project costs, and a project timeline
                      for management review. If approved by the WCC and TWC
                      management teams, the project will then be fully
                      initiated. Please note that the costs of any project are
                      not included in the $1.75mm service charge and will result
                      in an incremental charge to WCC.

                  THESE SERVICES WILL EXPIRE DECEMBER 31, 2004.

         in their entirety.

VI.      Audit Rights. WCC shall have the right to (or cause its accountants to)
         review the books and records of TWC at any time during reasonable
         business hours to (a) confirm that the services required to be provided

         and (b) to confirm the cost basis of any services provided by TWC which
         are not provided as part of the Annual Services Fee. The cost of such
         audit shall be borne by WCC, unless such audit shall reveal a
         discrepancy in the cost of any services in excess of 5%, in which case,
         the cost of such audit shall be borne by TWC.

VII.     No Agency. TWC shall perform its services under this Agreement as an
         independent contractor. Each party acknowledges and agrees that it is

         sufficient to meet manufacturing needs, or any other cause beyond the
         reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, and if such
         party shall have used its best efforts to avoid such occurrence and

         WCC that it is unable to perform on account of one or more reasons set
         forth in this section, WCC may obtain replacement services from a third
         party for the duration of such delay or inability to perform, or for
         such longer period as WCC shall be reasonably required to commit to in
         order to obtain such replacement services and the Annual Services Fee
         shall be reduced accordingly up to a maximum of the annual service fee
         calculated on a pro rate basis for each day services are not provided.
         However, WCC will not be permitted to recover any resultant or
         consequential damages due to the inability of TWC to perform.
