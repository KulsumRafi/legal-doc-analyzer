                                    (c) Benefit Payment Calculation. In the case
                           of a Plan Benefit payable under subsection (a) or (b)
                           above, installments paid during the first Plan Year
                           that the Plan Benefit is payable shall be amortized
                           as of the date the first installment is paid over the
                           installment period on the basis of the Interest that
                           would have been earned on an Account for such Plan
                           Year. The installments paid during each subsequent
                           Plan Year of the period of the Plan Benefit is
                           payable shall be amortized as of the first day of
                           such Plan Year over the then remaining installment
                           period on the basis of the Interest that would have
                           been earned on an Account for each such subsequent
                           Plan Year. The applicable Account of the Participant
                           shall continue to be credited with Interest during
                           the period Plan Benefits are payable.


         II.      Effective January 1, 2000, Section 5.5 is amended in its
                  entirety as follows:

                  5.5      Commencement of Payments. Payment of a Plan Benefit
         shall commence to a Participant or his Beneficiary on January 1, 2008,
         notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of this
         Plan. However, if the requirements of Section 5.10 are satisfied, a
         Participant may elect an earlier or later benefit commencement date.
         All payments shall be made as of the first day of the month.


         III.     Effective January 1, 2000, Section 5.6 is amended in its
                  entirety as follows:

                  5.6      Full Payment of Benefits. Notwithstanding any other
         provision of this Plan, all benefits not paid by the time the
         Participant attains or would have attained age seventy-five (75) shall
         be paid in a single sum at that time. In the event that a Participant
         election would cause his benefit payments to extend beyond his
         attainment of age seventy-five (75), the balance of any Plan Benefit
         payable to such Participant will be nevertheless amortized equally over
         the lesser of (1) the elected number of months; or (2) the number on
         months between commencement of payments and the Participant's
         attainment of age seventy-five (75).

         IV.      Effective January 1, 2000, the Plan is amended by the addition
                  of new Section 5.10 to read as follows:

                  5.10     Election of Form and Timing of Benefit Payment. The
         Company may, in its sole discretion, if a Participant so requests,
         change the form of benefit payment elected and/or the date benefit
         payments are to commence, provided that such request is made at least
         twelve full calendar months prior to his scheduled benefit commencement
         date. The Company shall be under no obligation to honor such change
         request and a Participant shall have no enforceable right under this
         Plan to such change.



                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has authorized its duly
appointed officers to execute this Amendment No. 1 this ____ day of June, 2000.

                           (a) Hardship Distributions. Upon finding that a
                  Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the
                  Committee may, in its sole discretion, allow distributions
                  from the Participant's Account prior to the time otherwise
                  specified in Section 5.5(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable)
                  for payment of Plan Benefits. The amount of such distribution
                  shall be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to meet
                  the Participant's requirements during the financial hardship
                  and shall not exceed the Account balance at the time of the
                  distribution or, for a Participant with a Disability at the
                  time of distribution, the Account balance.

                           (b) Other Financial Hardship. Upon finding that a
                  Participant has an immediate and heavy financial need, such as
                  the purchase of a Participant's principal residence or tuition
                  expenses and related educational fees for the next twelve
                  months of post-secondary education for the Participant, his
                  spouse, children or dependents, or such immediate and heavy
                  financial need as may be determined by the Committee on the
                  basis of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee
                  may, in its sole discretion, allow distributions from the
                  Participant's Account prior to the time otherwise specified in
                  Section 5.5(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable) for payment of
                  Plan Benefits. The amount of such distribution shall be
                  limited to the amount reasonably necessary to meet the
                  Participant's requirements during the financial need and shall
                  not exceed the Account balance at the time of the
                  distribution. Such withdrawals shall be subject to a ten
                  percent (10%) penalty (forfeiture) on the amount distributed.
                  In the event that the benefits payable under this Plan become
                  secured by a trust, any penalty (forfeiture) on a distribution
                  under this Section shall be allocated on a pro rata basis to
                  the Accounts of the other Participants.
