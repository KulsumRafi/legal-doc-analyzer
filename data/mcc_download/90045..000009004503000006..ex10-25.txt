WAIVER. Borrower has failed to comply with the required Funds Flow Coverage
Ratio for the quarter ending September 30, 2002. Borrower has requested Bank's
waiver, and Bank does hereby waive this failure to meet the Funds Flow Coverage
Ratio for the quarter ending September 30, 2002. This is a one-time waiver only.
After the quarter ending September 30, 2002, the provision regarding Funds Flow
Coverage Ratio shall remain in full force and effect as set forth herein.

WAIVER FEE. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement by Borrower,
Borrower shall deliver to Bank a modification fee in the amount of $5,000.00. In
addition, Borrower shall pay all legal fees associated with preparing this
Agreement.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS. Borrower acknowledges and represents that
the Note and other Loan Documents, as amended hereby, are in full force and
effect without any defense, counterclaim, right or claim of set-off; that, after
giving effect to this Agreement, no default or event that with the passage of

by the laws of the applicable state as originally provided in the Loan
Documents, without reference to that state's conflicts of law principles. This
Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the sole agreement of the

negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter thereof. No
amendment of this Agreement, and no waiver of any one or more of the provisions
hereof shall be effective unless set forth in writing and signed by the parties
hereto. The illegality, unenforceability or inconsistency of any provision of
this Agreement shall not in any way affect or impair the legality,
enforceability or consistency of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or

intended to be consistent. However, in the event of any inconsistencies among
this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents, the terms of this Agreement, and
then the Note, shall control. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties on separate counterparts. Each such
counterpart shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same agreement. Terms used in this Agreement
which are capitalized and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Note.

indebtedness and other obligations of every kind and description of the Borrower
to the Bank or to any Bank affiliate, whether or not under the Loan Documents,
and whether such debts or obligations are primary or secondary, direct or

Borrower reaffirms and restates the following with respect to the Note as
modified herein:

KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTELLIGENTLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS THE BORROWER HAS OR MAY HAVE TO PRIOR NOTICE AND AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING UNDER THE RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, OR ELSEWHERE INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, A HEARING PRIOR TO GARNISHMENT AND ATTACHMENT OF THE
BORROWER'S BANK ACCOUNT AND OTHER ASSETS. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS
THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINING A CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT CLAUSE
THAT BORROWER IS VOLUNTARILY, INTELLIGENTLY AND KNOWINGLY GIVING UP ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS, INCLUDING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, THAT BORROWER HAS OR MAY HAVE TO NOTICE
AND A HEARING BEFORE JUDGMENT CAN BE ENTERED AGAINST BORROWER AND BEFORE THE
BORROWER'S ASSETS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ITS BANK ACCOUNTS, MAY BE
GARNISHED, LEVIED, EXECUTED UPON AND/OR ATTACHED. BORROWER UNDERSTANDS THAT ANY
SUCH GARNISHMENT, LEVY, EXECUTION AND/OR ATTACHMENT SHALL RENDER THE PROPERTY
GARNISHED, LEVIED, EXECUTED UPON OR ATTACHED IMMEDIATELY UNAVAILABLE TO
BORROWER. IT IS SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY BORROWER THAT THE BANK HAS RELIED
ON THIS WARRANT OF ATTORNEY AND THE RIGHTS WAIVED BY BORROWER HEREIN IN
RECEIVING THIS AGREEMENT AND AS AN INDUCEMENT TO GRANT FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS
TO THE BORROWER.

If a Default occurs under the Note or any other Loan Documents, each Borrower
hereby jointly and severally authorizes and empowers any attorney of any court
of record or the prothonotary or clerk of any county in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, or in any jurisdiction where permitted by law or the clerk of any
United States District Court, to appear for Borrower in any and all actions
which may be brought hereunder and enter and confess judgment against the
Borrower or any of them in favor of the Bank for such sums as are due or may
become due hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, together with costs of
suit and actual collection costs including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees equal to 5% of the Obligations then due and owing but in no
event less than $5,000.00, with or without declaration, without prior notice,
without stay of execution and with release of all procedural errors and the
right to issue executions forthwith. To the extent permitted by law, Borrower
waives the right of inquisition on any real estate levied on, voluntarily
condemns the same, authorizes the prothonotary or clerk to enter upon the writ
of execution this voluntary condemnation and agrees that such real estate may be
sold on a writ of execution; and also waives any relief from any appraisement,
stay or exemption law of any state now in force or hereafter enacted. Borrower
further waives the right to any notice and hearing prior to the execution, levy,
attachment or other type of enforcement of any judgment obtained hereunder,
including, without limitation, the right to be notified and heard prior to the
garnishment, levy, execution upon and attachment of Borrower's bank accounts and
other property. If a copy of the Agreement verified by affidavit of any officer
of the Bank shall have been filed in such action, it shall not be necessary to
file the original thereof as a warrant of attorney, any practice or usage to the
contrary notwithstanding. The authority herein granted to confess judgment shall
not be exhausted by any single exercise thereof, but shall continue and may be
exercised from time to time as often as the Bank shall find it necessary and
desirable and at all times until full payment of all amounts due hereunder and
under any other Loan Documents. The Bank may confess one or more judgments in
the same or different jurisdictions for all or any part of the Obligations
arising hereunder or under any other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a
party, without regard to whether judgment has theretofore been confessed on more
than one occasion for the same Obligations. In the event that any judgment
confessed against the Borrower is stricken or opened upon application by or on
behalf of Borrower or any obligor for any reason, the Bank is hereby authorized
and empowered to again appear for and confess judgment against Borrower for any
part or all of the Obligations owing under the Note and/or for any other
liabilities, as herein provided.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER BY
EXECUTION HEREOF AND BANK BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
