Subject to the provisions hereof, including, without limitation, the
limitations contained in Section 7 hereof, this Warrant may be exercised at any
time during the Exercise Period (as defined below) by the holder hereof, in
whole or in part, by the surrender of this Warrant, together with a completed
exercise agreement in the form attached hereto (the <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">&#147;Exercise Agreement&#148;</font></b>), to the Company by 11:59 p.m. New York
time on any business day at the Company&#146;s principal executive offices (or such
other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the
holder hereof) and upon (i) payment to the Company in cash, by certified or
official bank check or by wire transfer for the account of the Company, of the
Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares specified in the Exercise Agreement or
(ii) if the holder is permitted to effect a Cashless Exercise (as defined in
Section 11(c) hereof) pursuant to Section 11(c) hereof, delivery to the Company
of a written notice of an election to effect a Cashless Exercise for the
Warrant Shares specified in the Exercise Agreement. The Warrant Shares so
purchased shall be deemed to be issued to the holder hereof or such holder&#146;s
designee, as the record owner of such shares, as of the close of business on
the date on which this Warrant shall have been surrendered and the completed
Exercise Agreement shall have been delivered and payment shall have been made
for such shares as set forth above or, if such day is not a business day, on
the next succeeding business day. The Warrant Shares so purchased, representing
the aggregate number of shares specified in the Exercise Agreement, shall be
delivered to the holder hereof within a reasonable time, not exceeding two
business days, after this Warrant shall have been so exercised (the <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">&#147;Deliver Period&#148;</font></b>).&#160; If the Company&#146;s transfer agent is
participating in the Depository Trust Company <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">(&#147;DTC&#148;</font></b>)
Fast Automated Securities Transfer program, and so long as the certificates
therefor do not bear a legend and the holder is not obligated to return such
certificate for the placement of a legend thereon, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to electronically transmit the Warrant Shares so purchased to
the holder by crediting the account of the holder or its nominee with DTC
through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">(&#147;DTC Transfer&#148;</font></b>). If the aforementioned conditions
to a DTC Transfer are not satisfied, the Company shall deliver to the holder
physical certificates representing the Warrant Shares so purchased. Further,
the holder may instruct the Company to deliver to the holder physical
certificates representing the Warrant Shares so purchased in lieu of delivering
such shares by way of DTC Transfer.&#160; Any
certificates so delivered shall be in such denominations as may be requested by
the holder hereof, shall be registered in the name of such holder or such other
name as shall be designated by such holder and, following the date on which the
Warrant Shares have been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to that
certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of April 1, 1999, by and
between the Company and the other signatories thereto (the <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">&#147;Registration Rights Agreement&#148;</font></b>) or
otherwise may be sold by the holder pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act (or a successor rule), shall not bear any restrictive
legend.&#160; If this Warrant shall have been
exercised only in part, then, unless this Warrant has expired, the Company
shall, as its expense, at the time of delivery of such certificates, deliver to
the holder a new Warrant representing the number of shares with respect to
which this Warrant shall not then have been exercised.</font></p>

or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration part or all of
which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash
received by the Company will be the fair market value of such consideration,

amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Market Price
thereof as of the date of receipt. In case any Common Stock, Options or

consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair market value of such
portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving corporation as is

case may be. The fair market value of any consideration other than cash or
securities will be determined in good faith by an investment banker or other

be borne by the Company.</font></p>

Financing, by (II) the gross proceeds to the Company of the Excepted Financing.
The Company shall calculate, using commercial valuation methods appropriate for

Excepted Financing exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000), then the Exercise
Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4 based on the issuance of the
pro-rata amount and type of securities issued in such Excepted Financing in

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, if the
resale of the Warrant Shares by the holder is not then registered pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, this Warrant may
be exercised at any time or from time to time during the Exercise Period, by
presentation and surrender of this Warrant to the Company at its principal
executive offices with a written notice of the holder&#146;s intention to effect a
cashless exercise, including a calculation of the number of shares of Common
Stock to be issued upon such exercise in accordance with the terms hereof (a &#147;<b><font style="font-weight:bold;">Cashless Exercise&#148;). </font></b>In the event of a
Cashless Exercise, in lieu of paying the Exercise Price in cash, the holder
shall surrender this Warrant for that number of shares of Common Stock determined
by multiplying (i) the number of Warrant Shares to which it would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the difference
between the last reported sale price per share of the Common Stock on the date
of exercise (as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, or if not so reported,
as reported on the principle United States securities market on which the
Common Stock is then traded) and the Exercise Price, and the denominator of
which shall be such last reported sale price per share of Common Stock.</font></p>
