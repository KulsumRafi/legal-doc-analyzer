<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mr.&nbsp;Boshart: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
am pleased to advise you that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Cross Country,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company") granted to you on the 26th day of March, 2003 (the
"Grant Date") 7,007 shares of the validly issued common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (the "Shares") subject to the terms and conditions of this letter. The purchase price for the
Shares is zero. The Shares are subject to certain restrictions relating to the passage of time as an employee of the Company. While such restrictions are in effect (the "Restriction Period"), the
Shares subject to such restrictions are referred to herein as "Restricted Stock." Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be made available only from authorized and unissued Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vesting.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Restricted Stock will become vested and cease to be Restricted Stock (but will remain subject to
paragraph&nbsp;8 of this letter) in three equal annual installments of 33<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL>% each, on the first, second and third anniversary of the Grant Date, provided that you remain continuously
employed by the Company at all times through the applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Stock will become vested and cease to be Restricted Stock (but will remain
subject to paragraph&nbsp;8 of this letter) at any time after the Company terminates your employment without "cause" (as defined in the Cross Country,&nbsp;Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Stock
Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plan")) or in the event your employment with the Company terminates due to your death or "disability" (as defined in the Stock Option Plan). In addition, the Restricted
Stock will become vested and cease to be Restricted Stock upon the occurrence of a "change in control" (as defined in the Stock Option Plan). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on Transfer.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Restriction Period you shall not sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate,
assign or otherwise encumber or dispose of the Shares, except as set forth in this Agreement. Any attempted sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, assignment or other disposition of the Shares in
violation of this Agreement shall be void and of no effect and the Company shall have the right to disregard the same on its books and records and to issue "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer
agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeiture.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as expressly provided in paragraph&nbsp;1 with respect to your termination due to death,
disability or by the Company without "cause, if your employment is terminated for any reason including, without limitation, retirement, resignation without "good reason" or for "cause" during the
relevant Restriction Period, you will forfeit to the Company, without compensation, any and all unvested Restricted Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights as a Holder of Restricted Stock.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From and after the Grant Date, you will have the right to vote the
Restricted Stock, to receive and retain all regular cash dividends payable to holders of Shares of record on and after the Grant Date (although such dividends will be treated, to the extent required
by applicable law, as additional compensation for tax purposes), and to exercise all other rights, powers and privileges of a holder of Shares with respect to the Restricted Stock, with the exceptions
that (i)&nbsp;you will not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Stock until the Restriction Period has expired; (ii)&nbsp;the Company (or
its designated agent) will retain custody of the stock certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Stock and any other property ("RS Property") issued in respect of the Restricted Stock,
including stock dividends (other than regular cash dividends which will be paid to you) during the Restriction Period; (iii)&nbsp;no RS Property will bear interest or be segregated in separate
accounts during the Restriction Period; and (iv)&nbsp;you may not transfer the Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period. </FONT></P>

(i)&nbsp;no later than the date on which any Restricted Stock shall have become vested, you will pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding payment of, any
federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any Restricted Stock which shall have become so vested; (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall, to the extent permitted
by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to you any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any Restricted Stock
which shall have become so vested, including that the Company may, but shall not be required to, sell a number of Shares sufficient to cover applicable withholding taxes; and (iii)&nbsp;in the event
that you do not satisfy (i)&nbsp;above on a timely basis, the Company may, but shall not be required to, pay such required withholding and treat such amount as a demand loan to you at the maximum
rate permitted by law, with such loan, at the
Company's sole discretion and provided the Company so notifies you within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the making of the loan, secured by the Shares and any failure by you to pay the loan upon demand
shall entitle the Company to all of the rights at law of a creditor secured by the Shares. The Company may hold as security any certificates representing any Shares and, upon demand of the Company,
you shall deliver to the Company any certificates in your possession representing Shares together with a stock power duly endorsed in blank. You also acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility,
and not the Company's, to file timely and properly any election under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and any corresponding provisions of state or local tax laws, if you wish to
utilize such election. </FONT></P>
