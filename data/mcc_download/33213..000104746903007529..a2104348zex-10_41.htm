<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT    <BR>  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is made effective as of the &laquo;Effective_Date&raquo;, by and between Equitable Resources,&nbsp;Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company") and &laquo;Indemnitee&raquo; (the "Indemnitee"), a director and/or officer of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, it is essential that the Company retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Indemnitee is a director and/or officer of the Company and in that capacity is performing a valuable service for the Company; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Company Bylaws (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Bylaw</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") contain a provision which provides for
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to the directors and officers of the Company for liabilities and expenses they incur in their capacities as such, and the Bylaws and the applicable
indemnification statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provide that they are not exclusive; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service
to the Company in an effective manner, the potential difficulty in obtaining satisfactory Directors and Officers Liability Insurance ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>D&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;O
Insurance</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") coverage, and Indemnitee's reliance on the Bylaws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by the Bylaws
will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of the Bylaws or any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or acquisition
transaction relating to the Company), the Company desires to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and
as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance policies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>NOW, THEREFORE</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, another
enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1. Indemnity of Indemnitee.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitee against any and all reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and any and all liability
and loss, including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, incurred or paid by Indemnitee in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter "a proceeding") and whether or not by or in the right of the Company or otherwise, to which
the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, or is threatened to be made a party or is involved (as a witness or otherwise) by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director or
officer of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as director, officer, employee, trustee or representative of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or representative, unless the act or failure to act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a court to have constituted willful misconduct or
recklessness; provided, however, that the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee (other than a proceeding to enforce the
Indemnitee's rights to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise) prior to a Change of Control, as defined in Section&nbsp;2(e), only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the foregoing limitation concerning certain proceedings initiated by the Indemnitee prior to a Change of Control, the Company shall pay the expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof promptly after receipt by the Company of a request
therefor stating in reasonable detail the expenses incurred or to be incurred. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a claim under paragraph&nbsp;(a) or (b)&nbsp;of this section is not paid in full by the Company within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after a written
claim has been received by the Company, the Indemnitee may, at any time thereafter, bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. The burden of proving that indemnification
or advances are not appropriate shall be on the Company. The Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim to the extent he or she is successful in whole or in
part on the merits or otherwise in establishing his or her right to indemnification or to the advancement of expenses. The Company shall pay such fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition
of such action on the terms and conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;1(b). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2. Maintenance of Insurance and Funding.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company represents that a summary of the terms of the policies of D&amp;O Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;A
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Insurance Policies</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
only to the provisions of Section&nbsp;2(b) hereof, the Company agrees that, so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as an officer or director of the Company (or shall
continue at the request of the Company to serve as a director, officer, employee, trustee or representative of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan) and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal or investigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company (or served in any of said other capacities), the Company shall purchase and maintain in
effect for the benefit of Indemnitee one or more valid, binding and enforceable policy or policies of D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance providing coverage at least comparable to that provided pursuant to the
Insurance Policies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall not be required to maintain said policy or policies of D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance in effect if, in the reasonable, good faith business judgment of the then
Board of Directors of the Company (i)&nbsp;the premium cost for such insurance is substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage, (ii)&nbsp;the coverage provided by such insurance is so
limited by exclusions that there is insufficient benefit from such insurance or (iii)&nbsp;said insurance is not otherwise reasonably available; provided, however, that in the event the then Board
of Directors makes such a judgment, the Company shall purchase and maintain in force a policy or policies of D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance in the amount and with such coverage as the then Board of Directors
determines to be reasonably available. Notwithstanding the general provisions of this Section&nbsp;2(b), following a Change of Control, any decision not to maintain any policy or policies of
D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance or to reduce the amount or coverage under any such policy or policies shall be effective only if there are Disinterested Directors (as defined in Section&nbsp;2(e) hereof) and
shall require the concurrence of a majority of the Disinterested Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
and to the extent the Company, acting under Section&nbsp;2(b), does not purchase and maintain in effect the policy or policies of D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance described
in Section&nbsp;2(a), the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnitee to the full extent of the coverage which would otherwise have been provided by such policies. The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to all other
rights of Indemnitee under the remaining provisions of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of a Potential Change of Control or if and to the extent the Company is not required to maintain in effect the policy or policies of D&nbsp;&amp; O Insurance
described in Section&nbsp;2(a) pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;2(b), the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, </FONT></P>

attorneys' fees, and any and all liability and loss, including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or
on his behalf for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or with respect to which indemnification is claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or otherwise; provided that in no event shall more than $100,000 be required to be deposited in any Trust created hereunder in excess of the amounts deposited in respect of reasonably
anticipated expenses, including attorneys' fees. The amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by a majority of the Disinterested Directors
whose determination shall be final and conclusive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a Change of Control (i)&nbsp;the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of the
Indemnitee, (ii)&nbsp;the Trust shall advance, within two business days of a request by the Indemnitee, any and all expenses, including attorneys' fees, to the Indemnitee (and the Indemnitee hereby
agrees to reimburse the Trust under the circumstances under which the Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the Company under Section&nbsp;5 of this Agreement), (iii)&nbsp;the Trust shall
continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above, (iv)&nbsp;the Trustee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee all amounts for which the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and (v)&nbsp;all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by a majority of the
Disinterested Directors or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, that the Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall be a bank or trust
company or other individual or entity chosen by the Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable and approved of by the Company. </FONT></P>

claim in respect thereof may be or is being made by the Indemnitee against the Company under this Agreement; provided, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Company is actually prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any action, suit or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee has so notified
the Company: </FONT></P>

connection with the defense, other than reasonable costs of investigation, including an investigation in connection with determining whether there exists a conflict of interest of the type described
in (ii)&nbsp;of this paragraph, or as otherwise provided in this paragraph. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her counsel in such action, suit or proceeding but the fees and
expenses of such counsel incurred after the Company notifies the Indemnitee of its assumption of the defense shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the Company authorizes the
Indemnitee's employment of counsel, provided, that following a Change of Control, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to employ his or her own counsel at the Company's expense after giving not less than
30&nbsp;days' notice to the Company unless a majority of the Disinterested Directors determine that the Indemnitee's interests are adequately represented by the counsel employed by the Company;
(ii)&nbsp;the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense or (iii)&nbsp;the Company
shall not have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion described in (ii)&nbsp;of this paragraph. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without its
written consent. The Company shall not settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's written consent. Neither the
