(b) A Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive his portion (i.e. 95% in the
case of Pachur and 5% in the case of Leon) of any of the payments pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) after the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) if he
shall resign as an employee of HI Services de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ("HI
Services") or of such other HIG Affiliate by whom he may later be employed, or
(ii) if HI Services terminates his employment For Cause (hereinafter defined).
It is understood that the resignation by or termination For Cause of one Seller
shall not effect the right of the other Seller to any payment under Section
1.3(a) to which he is entitled, provided that the Gross Revenue standards
required for such payment are satisfied. Further, the death or disability
(pursuant to the definition of disability set forth in the Federal Labor Law and
Social Security Law) of a Seller shall not effect the right of such Seller or
Seller's heirs to payments under Section 1.3(a), provided that the Gross Revenue
standards required for such payment are satisfied. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "For Cause" means: (i) a Seller's breach of this Agreement
or any other document, agreement or contract to which such Seller and HIG, HI
Services or another HIG Affiliate are a party, which is not remedied within
thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice specifying such breach; (ii)
a Seller's intentional failure to adhere to any written policy of HI Services
(or such other HIG Affiliate by whom he may later be employed), which is not
remedied within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice by the
employer specifying such failure; (iii) a Seller's appropriation (or attempted
appropriation) of a material business opportunity of HI Services or another of
HIG's Affiliates, including, without limitation, attempting to secure or
securing, any personal profit in connection with any transaction entered into on
behalf of HI Services or another of HIG's Affiliates; (iv) a Seller's commission
of (or attempt to commit) an act of fraud, illegality, theft or willful
misconduct toward HI Services or another of HIG's Affiliates; (v) a Seller's
conviction of, the indictment for (or its procedural equivalent), or the
entering of a guilty plea or plea of no contest or deferred adjudication with
respect to, a felony, the equivalent thereof, or any other crime with respect to
which imprisonment is a possible punishment; (vi) a Seller's absence from his
duties without the consent of the President of HI Services (or such other HIG
Affiliate by whom he may later be employed) for more than ten (10) consecutive
business days for reasons other than vacation authorized under this Agreement,
illness or injury; or (vii) the intentional failure of a Seller to carry out, or
comply with, in any material respect any directive of the President or Board of
Directors of HI Services (or such other HIG Affiliate by whom he may later be
employed) which is not remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of written
notice from the employer specifying such failure.

         SECTION 1.4 Liabilities. In connection with the purchase of the
Acquired Assets, and subject to and upon all the terms and condition of this
Agreement, at Closing, HIG shall not assume or agree to pay, perform and
discharge any liabilities or obligations of Bulco or Tempus. HIG is not
assuming, and shall have no liability for, and Seller agrees that Bulco and
Tempus have retained and are solely responsible for, the payment, performance,
and discharge of all liabilities of Bulco and Tempus, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise (collectively, the "Retained Liabilities").Seller shall
indemnify and hold HIG harmless from and against the Retained Liabilities.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 1.5 Gross Sales Statement. Within thirty (30) days after the
expiration of each of the 2003, 2004 and 2005 calendar years, HIG shall deliver
to Seller a written statement (the "Gross Sales Statement") setting forth the
Gross Sales derived from the Facilities for the subject calendar year, and such
supporting information as shall be reasonably necessary for Seller to confirm
such Gross Sales. The Gross Sales shall be certified by the Chief Financial
Officer of HIG to the effect that such statement reflects the Gross Sales
derived from the Facilities for the subject calendar year and that such Gross
Sales were determined consistent with U.S. GAAP. Within fifteen (15) days after
its receipt of the Gross Sales, Seller shall deliver to the Chief Financial
Officer of HIG a written acceptance of the Gross Sales reflected thereon or a
written notice that Seller desires to review the books and records related to
Gross Sales for such period. Seller shall complete any such requested review
within sixty (60) days after his receipt of the Gross Sales Statement. To the
extent that any such review indicates that the Gross Sales reflected on the
Gross Sales Statement were inaccurate, the Gross Sales shall be increased or
decreased, as the case may be. If HIG and Seller are unable to resolve any
dispute concerning the Gross Sales through the procedure outlined above, such
unresolved dispute shall be submitted for further determination to a regionally
recognized accounting firm located in the United States to be mutually selected
by HIG and Seller, and the determination by such accounting firm shall be made
within ninety (90) days following the submission to them of such dispute and
such determination shall be binding upon Seller and HIG. If HIG and Seller
cannot mutually agree upon such accounting firm, HIG shall select an independent
internationally recognized accounting firm that has not provided services to HIG
or its Affiliates during the previous five (5) year period. Seller and HIG shall
each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of such accounting firm
resolving such dispute.

         SECTION 1.6 Specific Transfers. Without limitation to the general
transfers and assignments described in Section 1.1, Seller hereby transfers and
assigns to HIG the following intangible rights of Seller:

                  (a) Acknowledgements and Files. All the necessary

general all the files and paperwork other than accounting records stored at such
address, and any other document or information useful to HIG or its Affiliates
in the management and operation of the Business .

                  (b) Trademarks. All the Intellectual Property rights
corresponding to trademarks "Timeless Reflections" and "Ole".

         SECTION 5.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. HIG and Seller may not

                  (b) by HIG or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on
         or before March 31, 2003, unless the failure to effect the Closing is
         the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking
         to terminate; and

                  (c) by HIG or Seller:

                           (i) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an

                  enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing
                  and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
                  become final and nonappealable as long as the party seeking to
                  terminate is not liable for the issuance of such order,
                  decree, ruling or action; and

                           (ii) in the event of any breach by HIG, on the one
                  hand, or by Seller, on the other hand, of its or his
                  respective agreements, representations or warranties contained
                  herein and the failure of such party to cure such breach
                  within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from any other
                  party requesting such breach to be cured.

         SECTION 6.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this

of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 7.1 Indemnification. By Seller. From and after the Closing
Date, Seller, shall, jointly and severally, (i) indemnify and hold harmless the
HIG and its Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates,
successors and assigns and attorneys from and against any and all losses which
it or such persons may suffer or incur, resulting from, related to or arising
out of (a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of Seller contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents; (b) any
breach by Seller or Seller's Affiliates of any of his agreements or obligations
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents; and (c) any liability or obligation arising out of the Intangible
Assets as conducted prior





INTANGIBLE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT - PAGE 14

<PAGE>

to the Closing and not expressly assumed by HIG pursuant to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the Retained Liabilities; and (ii) reimburse HIG
and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees
and attorneys for any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses related
thereto (including without limitation, reasonable legal expenses).

                  (b) By HIG. From and after the Closing Date, HIG shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and his heirs, personal representatives,
administrators, and trustees, from and against any and all losses, which any of
them may suffer or incur, resulting from, related to or arising out of (a) any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty of HIG which is contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement; (b) any breach by HIG of any of its agreements or
obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement; and (c) any and all
claims or litigation arising out of any of the foregoing; and (ii) reimburse
each Seller and his heirs, personal representatives, administrators, and
trustees for any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses related thereto
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal expenses).

                  (c) Direct Liability. In the event that the person or entity
seeking indemnification under this Article 7 (the "Indemnified Party") shall
become aware of an event which will give rise to or result in an Indemnifiable
Loss, he, she or it shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, give written
notice to the party from whom indemnification under this Article 7 is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss, together
with sufficient information to enable the Indemnifying Party to determine the
accuracy and nature of the claimed Indemnifiable Loss (the "Indemnity Notice").
The failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party an Indemnity
Notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from liability under this
Article 8; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for losses which would not have been incurred but for the delay in the delivery
of, or the failure to deliver, the Indemnity Notice. Within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the Indemnity Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall either (i) pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal
to the Indemnifiable Loss, or (ii) object to such claim, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of such
objection together with the reasons therefor, it being understood that the
failure of the Indemnifying Party to so object shall preclude the Indemnifying
Party from asserting any claim, defense or counterclaim relating to the
Indemnifying Party's failure to pay any Indemnifiable Loss.

                  (d) Third Party Claim. In the event the facts giving rise to
the claim for indemnification under this Article 7 shall involve any action or
threatened claim or demand by any third party against the Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), within the earlier of, as applicable, ten (10) days after
receiving notice of the filing of a lawsuit or thirty (30) days after receiving
notice of the existence of a claim, demand, suit or proceeding (each a "Claim")
giving rise to the claim for indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall send
written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party (the "Claim Notice"). The
failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party the Claim Notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Article 7;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for losses
incurred by the Indemnified Party which would not have been incurred but for the
delay in the delivery of, or the failure to deliver, the Claim Notice. Except as
set forth below, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to defend such Claim
in the name of the Indemnified Party at his or its own expense and through
counsel of his or its own choosing. The Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party notice in writing within




INTANGIBLE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT - PAGE 15

<PAGE>

ten (10) days after receiving the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party in the
event the Claim is one involving an instituted suit or proceeding, or otherwise
within thirty (30) days, of his or its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Indemnified
Party may elect, by notice in writing to the Indemnifying Party, to continue to
participate through his or its own counsel, at his or its expense, but the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of the Claim with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of the Claim and shall have
negotiated a settlement thereof, which proposed settlement is final and
unconditional as to the parties thereto and contains an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party, without the Indemnified Party being liable for damages of
any kind or nature or being otherwise required to pay any amount of money to any
third party and does not include the imposition of any restrictions on the part
of the Indemnified Party or require that the Indemnified Party make an admission
of guilt or liability or deliver a confession of judgment, or any other
non-financial obligation which, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party, renders such settlement unacceptable, the Indemnified Party shall consent
to such settlement.

         SECTION 7.2 Right to Set-Off. To secure the indemnification provided
for in Section 7.1(a) hereof, and to compensate HIG for any claim having as its
basis the indemnification provided for in Section 7.1(a) hereof, HIG and its
Affiliates shall have a right of set-off from any sum due to Seller, Bulco or
Tempus or any of their Affiliates, including sums due under this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Documents.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 8.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date.

         SECTION 8.2 Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if delivered personally when received if or sent by overnight courier
(providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses (or at
such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

the Executive agrees to be employed by the Company, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, for an unspecified term in such position as
the Board of Directors of the Company shall prescribe. The Executive agrees that
regardless of the term for which this Agreement is executed, he will perform his
services for the Company for at least three (3) years from the date of execution

                           (i) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive
                  shall have such powers and duties as may from time to time be
                  assigned or delegated to him by the President of the Company,

                  inherent with such position. The Executive shall be bound to
                  carry out any other work related to his main obligation
                  provided that his salary is not modified, and shall also be in

                           (ii) During the term of this Agreement, excluding any
                  periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is
                  entitled, the Executive agrees to devote all of his business
                  time to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the
                  extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to
                  the Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's best efforts
                  to perform faithfully, effectively and efficiently such
                  responsibilities. The Executive will use his best efforts to
                  promote the success of the Company's business, and will
                  cooperate fully with the management of the Company.

                  (b) Compensation.

                           (i) Base Salary. During the term of this Agreement,
                  the Executive shall receive, at such intervals and in
                  accordance with such Company policies as may be in effect from
                  time to time, an annual salary (pro rata for any partial year)
                  equal to _____________ Mexican pesos equal to U.S. $150,000.00
                  converted at__________ (the "Annual Base Salary"), payable in
                  equal installments each fifteen (15) days as required by the
                  Mexican Labor Law. The Annual Base Salary shall be subject to
                  appropriate increase, as determined in the sole and absolute
                  discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company in the
                  advancement of the best interests of the Company.

                           (ii) Salary Receipt. Every pay day, the Executive
                  shall execute a receipt prepared by the Company in the
                  Company's favor, covering all of the salary he earned up to
                  that date, on the understanding that the execution of the
                  receipt shall imply his agreement that the salary received
                  covers all of the work performed, and that he shall not claim
                  payment of any amount, as he must claim said payment to which
                  he believes he is entitled, precisely upon executing the
                  receipt. The Executive's execution of the receipt, shall
                  constitute a release for the Company for any salary or
                  benefits to which the Executive might be entitled for his
                  services rendered up to that date, even though the receipt
                  does not so state.

                           (iii) Annual Bonus. The Executive shall be eligible
                  to receive, for each calendar year commencing with the
                  calendar year ending December 31, 2003, an annual bonus up to
                  thirty percent (30%) of the Annual Base Salary, which annual
                  bonus shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the
                  Company from time to time within its sole and absolute
                  discretion (the "Annual Bonus"). Each Annual Bonus shall be
                  paid in cash in accordance with the Company's policies in
                  effect from time to time. The Annual Bonus will be reduced, at
                  the option of the

                  Company, by amounts paid to Executive as a Christmas bonus and
                  by other bonuses, if any, required to be paid to Executive by
                  Federal Labor Law.


                           (iv) Stock Options. On or before June 30, 2003, Home

                  of the State of Texas, United States of America and an
                  affiliate of the Company ("HIG"), at an exercise price of U.S.
                  $19.42 per share. The stock options will be evidenced by a
                  separate Option Agreement and will be granted pursuant to, and
                  subject to the terms and conditions of HIG's 2002 Stock Option
                  Plan for Key Employees. The options will vest and become
                  exercisable in the manner and at the times provided in the
                  Option Agreement. HIG or the Company, as appropriate, shall
                  include the profit of such options on the date of exercise
                  (i.e. the difference between the exercise price and the fair
                  market value) in the income deemed to have been paid to the
                  Executive .

                  (c) Compulsory Days Off. The Executive shall enjoy the
         compulsory days off established in the Federal Labor Law, provided with
         full paid salary.

                  (d) Vacations. The Executive shall enjoy vacations for each
         year of services rendered, as provided in Article 76 of the Federal
         Labor Law, understanding that said vacation period will be granted
         after a full year of services rendered. The Company shall determine the
         period within the year in which the Executive shall be allowed to take
         his vacation, and the Executive shall ask for said period at least a
         month in advance.

                  (e) Christmas Bonus. As prescribed by Federal Labor Law, the
         Executive shall receive payment of 15 (fifteen) days of his Annual Base
         Salary as a Christmas bonus, which shall be paid by the Company before
         the twentieth of December of each year. For any calendar year in which
         Executive is not employed by the Company for the entire calendar year,
         the Christmas bonus shall be reduced for that year in proportion to the
         amount of time Executive was not employed by the Company.

                  (f) Weekly Days Off. The Executive shall enjoy two weekly days
         off with full paid salary; both parties agree that the day off shall be
         the Saturday and Sunday of each week; the salary for the days off is
         included in the Annual Base Salary. The Executive expressly authorizes

         pursuant to this Agreement, and in accordance with the Company's
         policies, practices and procedures. The Executive must file expense

         further payment obligations to the Executive other than for payment of
         Accrued Obligations.

<PAGE>

         and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had
         never comprised a portion of this Agreement; and the remaining
         provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
         shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
         provision or by its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu
         of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be
         added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in
         terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
         possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.

                  (c) Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amounts
         payable under this Agreement such Federal, state or local taxes as
         shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or

         the Executive's obligations hereunder.

                  (e) Waiver. The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist
         upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or the
         failure to assert any right the Executive or the Company may have
         hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or right
         or any other provision or right of this Agreement.

                  (f) Territory. Pursuant to the Company's activities and
         considering the nature of his duty, the Executive is bound to perform

         his job in any other position without prejudice of his wages.

                  (g) Confidential Executive. As a consequence of the
         confidential nature of the activities that the Executive will be
         performing and that consequently, law requirements are met, both
         parties agree that the Executive is, and for all legal purposes will be
         considered as a confidential employee.

         instruct the Executive as provided in the Federal Labor Law pursuant to

         language, and all communications between the parties relative to this
         Agreement shall be conducted in the English language only. Any version
         of this Agreement in the English language, whether or not executed by
         the parties, is and shall be prepared solely for the benefit of the
         Executive and shall be considered a non-binding translation of the
         Agreement.

                  (j) Currency and Payment. Unless otherwise agreed, all amounts
         payable hereunder shall be calculated and payable in Mexican pesos.

                  (k) Applicable Law. Both parties agree that everything which
         is not expressly provided for hereunder shall be governed by the
         Federal Labor Law and that for every thing regarding the construction,
         execution and fulfillment of this Agreement they

NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT - PAGE 2

<PAGE>

                  (a) Suppliers. The Pachur Parties agree to recommend to all
         suppliers, whether verbally or in writing, that following the Closing
         of the Asset Purchase Agreement, all such suppliers do business with HI
         Metals. The names of Tempus' and Bulco's suppliers are attached hereto
         as Exhibit "A".

                  (b) Employees. The Pachur Parties shall use best efforts to
         maintain good employee morale on the parts of the persons who until the
         Closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement were employees of Tempus.

         4. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.

         As a material inducement to the HIG Companies to enter into and perform
their obligations under this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
Employment Agreement, the Pachur Parties covenant and agree, as follows:

                  (a) For a period commencing on the date hereof and ending two
         (2) years following the date that Pachur's employment with HI Services
         or an affiliate of HI Services terminates (the "Restricted Period");
         provided, however, that the Restricted Period shall not be less than a
         period of five (5) years following the date hereof, the Pachur Parties
         shall not, directly or indirectly, alone or in conjunction with any
         other corporation, firm, partnership, person, venture or other entity
         (except as a holder of an aggregate of not more than five percent (5%)
         of the outstanding stock of a corporation or partnership whose stock or
         partnership interests are listed on a national securities exchange or
         traded over the counter on NASDAQ) own, manage, operate, join, control,
         work for, permit the use of their names by, consult with or engage in
         any activity anywhere within the United States of America or Mexico
         (the "Territory"), that is in any way competitive with any aspect of
         the business, as presently conducted or as conducted by the HIG
         Companies during the term of this Agreement.

                  (b) The covenant contained in Section 4(a) above shall be
         deemed to be a series of separate and severable covenants, one for each
         state located in the Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each
         such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms with the
         covenant contained in Section 4(a). If, in any judicial proceeding, a
         court should refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed
         included in Section 4(a) because taken together they cover too
         extensive a geographic area, then it is intended that those of such
         covenants which, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate
         covenants to be enforced in such proceedings shall, for the purpose of
         such proceeding, be deemed eliminated from the provisions hereof.

                  (c) The covenant contained in Section 4(a) above shall be
         deemed to be a series of separate and severable covenants, one for each
         successive month during the terms of said covenants. If, in any
         judicial proceeding, a court should refuse to enforce all of the
         separate covenants because taken together they cover too long a period
         of time, then the last of such covenants in time which, if eliminated,
         would permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in such
         proceeding shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed
         eliminated from the provisions hereof.



NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT - PAGE 3

<PAGE>

                  (d) Any and all Proprietary Information (hereinafter defined)
         which the Pachur Parties heretofore obtained or may hereafter obtain
         with respect to the conduct and/or details of any portion of the
         business conducted by the HIG Companies or any of their affiliates, or
         their respective successors, shall be held inviolate and shall not be
         revealed to any competitor of the HIG Companies or any other person,
         partnership, firm, corporation or entity. The Pachur Parties shall not
         make any use of such Proprietary Information, except for and on behalf
         of the HIG Companies. "Proprietary Information" shall mean knowledge
         and information, relating to any portion of the business of the HIG
         Companies or their affiliates whether written or oral, which: (i) is
         not generally available to the public; (ii) gives or may give any
         competitive advantage to the HIG Companies with respect to the
         operation of the business or their successors; or, (iii) if disclosed,
         could give any advantage to a competitor of the business or their
         successors or could otherwise be deleterious to any portion of the
         business.

                  (e) During the Restricted Period, the Pachur Parties will not,
         directly or indirectly, request, induce, influence or solicit any
         employee, customer, or supplier of the HIG Companies or any affiliate
         of the HIG Companies known by the Pachur Parties, as the case may be
         (through the exercise of due diligence), to cease being an employee,
         customer or supplier of the HIG Companies or any affiliate of the HIG
         Companies, or to terminate or alter his or her employment or business
         relationship with the HIG Companies.

                  (f) The parties recognize that the goodwill and going concern
         value of the business being purchased and acquired by the HIG Companies
         are very closely related to the special, unique and extraordinary
         knowledge and skill of the Pachur Parties and that the consummation by
         the HIG Companies of this Agreement will be in reliance upon the
         unconditional assurance of the Pachur Parties that they will fully
         comply with the terms of this Agreement, particularly, but not limited
         to, such terms as they relate to covenants and undertakings not to
         engage in competition or to divulge information. Further, the period of
         protection of the HIG Companies against the competition of the Pachur
         Parties and the geographical area within which such protection is
         essential has been agreed by the parties to be reasonable and
         necessary. Therefore, if the Pachur Parties shall at any time breach or
         in any manner violate any such covenant, then the HIG Companies in
         addition to, but not in substitution for, any and all other relief to
         which the HIG Companies may be entitled either at law or in equity,
         shall be entitled to equitable relief against the Pachur Parties by way
         of injunction to restrain the Pachur Parties from such breach and to
         compel compliance by the Pachur Parties with their obligations
         hereunder. The Pachur Parties do hereby waive any proof: (i) that such
         breach will cause irreparable injury to the HIG Companies, or, (ii)
         that there is no adequate remedy at law.

                  (g) In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
         refuse to enforce the provisions of the restrictive covenant set forth
         in Section 4(a) of this Agreement because it deems the length of time
         or the geographical area to be excessive or unreasonable, then the time
         period or the geographical area, or both, shall be deemed to be amended
         to conform to such time period and geographical area as such court
         shall determine to be reasonable and not excessive.


NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT - PAGE 4

<PAGE>

                  (h) The period of time applicable to any covenant in Section 4
         will be extended by the duration of any violation by the Pachur Parties
         of such covenant.

                  (i) The Pachur Parties will, while the covenant under Section
         4 is in effect, give written notice to the HIG Companies, within ten
         (10) days after accepting any other employment or consulting
         arrangement, of the identity of the Pachur Parties' new employer or
         contractor and all of the material duties and services to be provided
         by the Pachur Parties in such employment or retention. The HIG
         Companies may notify such new employer that the Pachur Parties are
         bound by this Agreement and, at the HIG Companies' election, furnish
         such new employer with a copy of this Agreement or relevant portion
         thereof.

                  (j) The covenants by the Pachur Parties in this Section 4 are
         essential elements of this Agreement, and without the Pachur Parties'
         agreement to comply with such covenants, the HIG Companies would not

         Parties have independently consulted their respective counsel and have

         considered a non-binding translation of the Agreement.

                  (e) Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be construed,
         interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of

HI Metals, S.A. de C.V.

Dear Sirs:

         RE:      PURCHASE BY HI METALS, S.A. DE C.V. ("BUYER") OF THE ASSETS
                  OF TEMPUS CORPORATION. S.A. DE C.V. AND BULCO, S.A. DE C.V.
                  ("SELLERS")

We have acted as counsel for the Sellers in connection with the sale of all the
Sellers's assets to Buyer, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement made as of
January 25, 2003, (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") between Buyer and the Sellers
and Messrs. Miguel Angel Pachur Salgado and Oscar Guadalupe De Leon Ulloa (the
Shareholders"), and an Intangible Asset Purchase Agreement made as of January
25, 2003, (the "Intangible Asset Purchase Agreement") between Buyer and the
Shareholders. The Asset Purchase Agreement and the Intangible Asset Purchase
Agreement are jointly referred as the "Asset Purchase Agreements" Terms used in
this opinion that are defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement and are not
otherwise defined herein will have the same meaning herein as in the Asset
Purchase Agreements.

MATERIALS REVIEWED


         We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
         to our satisfaction, of:

         (a)      the Asset Purchase Agreements;

         (b)      the Non-Competition Agreement between Sellers and Buyer made
                  as of January 29, 2003, (the "Non-Competition Agreement"); and

         (c)      the Employment Agreement made as of January 29, 2003, (the
                  "Employment Agreement").

         The Asset Purchase Agreements, the Non-Competition Agreement and the
Employment Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Agreements".

ASSUMPTIONS AND FACT RELIANCE

         We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
to our satisfaction, of such public and corporate records, certificates,
instruments and other documents and have considered such questions of law as we
have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter
expressed. In such examination we have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as
copies, whether facsimile, photostatic, certified or otherwise.

         We have also assumed that each of the Agreements have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitute a valid and legally
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms.








<PAGE>

OPINIONS

         Based and relying upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications
hereinafter expressed, we are of the opinion that:

         1.       The Sellers are corporations incorporated and subsisting under
                  the laws of the United Mexican States ("Mexico"), and the
                  Shareholders are citizens of Mexico, of age, and in full
                  capacity to execute legal documents.

         2.       The articles of the Sellers contain no restrictions on the
                  powers that the Seller may exercise on the transfer of assets.

         3.       The execution, delivery and performance of each of the
                  Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary
                  corporate action on the part of the Sellers.

         4.       Each of the Asset Purchase Agreements, the Non-Competition
                  Agreement and the Employment Agreement constitute a valid and
                  legally binding obligation of the Sellers and the
                  Shareholders, enforceable against the Sellers and the
                  Shareholders in accordance with its terms.

         5.       The execution and delivery by the Sellers and the Shareholders
                  of each of the Agreements and the performance by the Sellers
                  and the Shareholders of their respective obligations
                  thereunder will not:

                  (a)      contravene or results in a breach of or constitute a
                           default under the articles or by-laws of the Sellers;
                           or

                  (b)      contravene any law or regulation of the United
                           Mexican States applicable therein.

                  6. All necessary consents, approvals, orders and
                  authorizations of, and registrations, declarations or filings
                  with, any governmental authority in Mexico required for the
                  execution and delivery by the Sellers and the Shareholders of
                  the Agreements and the performance by the Sellers and the
                  Shareholders of their respective obligations thereunder have
                  been obtained.

QUALIFICATIONS

         The opinions expressed above are subject to the following
qualifications:

         (a)      this opinion is limited to the laws of Mexico applicable
                  therein;

         (b)      the enforceability of each of the Agreements is subject to
                  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
                  laws of general application limiting the enforcement of
                  creditors' rights generally; and

         (c)      the validity and enforceability of provisions inserted in any
                  agreement or instrument that purport to sever from the
                  agreement or instrument any provision that is prohibited or
                  unenforceable under applicable law without affecting the
                  enforceability or validity of the remainder of the agreement
                  or instrument would be determined only in the discretion of
                  the court.
