desire to fully settle and resolve any and all issues arising out of Executive's
employment with United and the termination of his or her full time employment
as an executive officer by United;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, United wishes to
retain certain limited services of Executive, and Executive wishes to provide
said services to United, in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth herein; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, Executive has agreed
in this Agreement to provide such services and to release United from certain

by and between United and Executive as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Continued Employment</u>.&nbsp;
Effective as of the Effective Date, Executive will continue to be actively
employed by United, and Executive will perform services for United by being
"on call", including testifying on behalf of United, and subject to such
other assignments consistent with Executive's experience and reasonably
acceptable to Executive as may be reasonably requested by either the person
who is Executive's supervisor immediately prior to the Effective Date (the
"Supervisor") or the Supervisor's successor; provided that such requests
shall not unreasonably interfere with any employment or business pursuits,
including consulting, that Executive may be engaged in from time to time.

Employment</u>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United agrees to employ Executive and

</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the benefits
enumerated in Paragraph 3(C) is subject to the practices, rules, and regulations
of United, as in effect from time to time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that any payment or
benefit received or to be received by Executive hereunder, when taken together
with any payment or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the
terms of any other plan, arrangement or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called "Total
Payments") would be subject (in whole or part), to any excise tax (the
"Excise Tax") imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), then, the payments under Paragraph 3(A)
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) shall
thereafter be eliminated, to the extent necessary so that no portion of
the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but only if (A) the net
amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the
net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total
Payments) is greater than or equal to (B) the net amount of such Total
Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount
of Excise Tax to which Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced
Total Payments); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect
to have individual benefits under Paragraph 3(C) eliminated prior to any
reduction of the cash payments under Paragraphs 3(A).
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; For purposes of determining whether and the
extent to which the Total Payments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments
the receipt or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyment of which
Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not to constitute a "payment" within the meaning of section 280G(b) of
the Code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be taken into
account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
account which, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably
acceptable to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive and selected
by the accounting firm (the "Auditor") which was,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
immediately prior to the Effective Date, United's independent auditor,
does not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Code (including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in
calculating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Excise Tax, no portion
of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for
services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually rendered, within
the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the Base Amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable
to such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable compensation, and (iii)
the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by
the Auditor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in accordance with the principles
of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act</u>.
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
in the event that any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payment
or benefit received or to be received by the Executive hereunder, when
taken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together with any payment
or benefits received or to be received pursuant to the terms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of any other plan, arrangement, or agreement with United, or any affiliate
thereof&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is, in the opinion
of counsel selected by United ("Counsel"), included in "Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Compensation" as defined by Section 104(b) of the Air Transportation Safety
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System Stabilization Act (the "Act")
would, in the opinion of Counsel, exceed the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act, then the payments under Paragraph
3(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; included in Total Compensation
shall first be reduced and individual benefits under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paragraph 3(C) included in Total Compensation shall thereafter be eliminated,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Executive may elect to have individual
benefits under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 3(C) eliminated
prior to any reduction of the cash payments under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paragraph 3(A).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 3(F)(i) will
not apply if (a) United does not apply for Federal credit instrument under
the Act by the deadline stipulated in the Act or any amendment thereto
or (b) if United does apply for a Federal credit instrument under the Act
by the deadline but such Federal credit instrument is not actually issued
to United for any reason other than because the Executive's Total Compensation
exceeds the limitation under Section 104(a) of the Act.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Termination
of Employment Under Agreement</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-Election
of Executive</u>.&nbsp; Executive's employment under this Agreement shall
terminate and Executive will no longer have the status of an active employee
of United and will no longer be entitled to any of the benefits of this
Agreement (including the entitlement to the payment and benefits described
in Paragraph 3(C), other than those required by law or otherwise vested),
on the happening of the earliest of the following events:
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive's death;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any material breach by Executive of Paragraph 6 or 9 hereof or the failure
by Executive to provide notice to United
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pursuant&nbsp; to Paragraph 4(B)(i) hereof;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive's termination for Cause (as defined below).</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes hereof, "Cause" shall mean (a) the willful and continued failure
by Executive to substantially perform Executive's duties with United (other
than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical
or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive by the Supervisor, which demand specifically identifies
the manner in which the Supervisor believes that Executive has not substantially
performed Executive's duties, and Executive shall not have substantially
performed within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,&nbsp;
(b) the willful engaging by Executive in conduct, including any conduct
that is a violation of Executive's duties set forth under Paragraph 7 or
8 hereof, which is demonstrably and materially injurious to United or its
subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise or (c) Executive's conviction for
the commission of a felony.&nbsp; For purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of
this definition, no act, or failure to act, on Executive's part shall be
deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive not in
good faith and without reasonable belief that Executive's act, or failure
to act, was in the best interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Election
of Executive</u>.&nbsp; (i) During the Term, if Executive elects to terminate
his or her employment for any reason, Executive will receive no further
payments under Paragraphs 3(A) above, and will no longer be entitled to
any benefits under Paragraph 3(C) (other than benefits required by law
or otherwise vested). Before Executive's election to terminate under this
paragraph can become effective, Executive must have provided United seven
(7) days' written notice of his election by registered mail addressed to
the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters offices.&nbsp;
Executive's termination of employment will be as of the seventh (7th) day
after receipt by United of such notice, at which time he or she will no
longer have the status of an active employee of United (including the entitlement
to benefits described in Paragraph 3(C), other than benefits required by
law or otherwise vested).
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Term, if Executive
takes a Competitive Position (as defined below) with a Competitor (as defined
below) upon agreeing to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such employment,
he:
<dir>&nbsp;
<br>(a) must immediately so notify United in writing by registered mail
addressed to the General Counsel of United at its principal World Headquarters
offices;
<p>(b) will be deemed to have elected to terminate his employment under
this Agreement (including the entitlement to benefits described in Paragraph
3(C)) effective as of the day Executive becomes employed by such Competitor;
and
<p>(c) will be entitled to no further compensation after such effective
date.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
For purposes of this Agreement, (1) "Competitor" means any airline or air
carrier or any company affiliated, directly or indirectly, with another
airline or air carrier and (2) "Competitive Position" means becoming employed
by, a member of the board of directors of, a consultant to, or to otherwise
provide services of any nature to a Competitor directly or indirectly.&nbsp;
If during the Term, Executive desires to provide services whether as a
consultant, employee or otherwise to a Competitor and requests that United
consent to such provision of such services, United will reasonably consider
such request and will not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its
consent.&nbsp; In the event United consents to Executive's providing such
services, there will not be a termination of the Executive's employment
under the Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 4(B)(ii).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Survival</u>.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding any termination of Executive's employment under this Agreement,
Executive shall continue to be bound by (1) the provisions of Paragraphs
6 through 16 hereof, and (2) the provisions of Paragraph 4(B)(ii)(a) hereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Regulations</u>.&nbsp;
During his or her employment, Executive will be governed by applicable
United regulations, as in effect from time to time, to the extent that
such regulations are consistent with Executive's status as an on-call employee.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Confidentiality</u>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For purposes of this Agreement "Confidential Information" shall mean and
include, but not be limited to, the kinds of services provided or proposed
to be provided by United to customers, the manner in which such services
are performed or offered to be performed, information concerning United's
fleet plan, cost structure, strategic plan, labor strategy, information
concerning the creation, acquisition or disposition of products and services,
personnel information, and other trade secrets and confidential or proprietary
information concerning United's business, but shall not include information
which (I) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Executive, (II) was available to Executive
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by UAL or UA, or (III)
becomes available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a person
other than UAL, UA or their officers, directors, employees or agents who
is not otherwise bound by any confidentiality obligations with respect
to the information provided to Executive (the "Confidential Information").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp; Executive acknowledges that: (a) United's business is intensely
competitive and that Executive's employment by United has required and
during the Term may continue to require that Executive have access to and
knowledge of Confidential Information of United, (b) the direct or indirect
disclosure of any Confidential Information would place United at a disadvantage
and would do damage, monetary or otherwise, to United's business, and (c)
the engaging by Executive in any of the activities prohibited by this Paragraph
6 may constitute improper appropriation or use of such Confidential Information.&nbsp;
Executive expressly acknowledges the trade secret status of the Confidential
Information and that the Confidential Information constitutes a protectible
business interest of United.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp; Whether directly or indirectly, individually, as a director,
stockholder, owner, partner, employee, principal, or agent of any business,
or in any other capacity, during the Term of this Agreement and for the
two (2) year period thereafter, Executive shall not make known, disclose,
furnish, make available or utilize any of the Confidential Information,
other than in the proper performance of the duties contemplated under this
Agreement.&nbsp; Executive shall return any tangible Confidential Information,
including photocopies, extracts and summaries thereof, or any such information
stored electronically on tapes, computer disks, or in any other manner
that Executive has in his possession (a) on the Effective Date of this
Agreement, (b) at the end of the Term, and (c) at such time as United requests
Executive to do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii) Executive acknowledges and agrees that due to the confidential and
proprietary nature of the Confidential Information he or she possesses,
a breach or threatened breach by him or her of any of the provisions contained
in this Paragraph 6 will cause United irreparable injury.&nbsp; Therefore,
in addition to any other rights or remedies, Executive agrees that United
shall be entitled to a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunction
enjoining or restraining Executive from any such violation or threatened
violation, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary
damages or the posting of any bond or security.&nbsp; Executive consents
to jurisdiction for such enforcement in any state or federal court in the
State of Illinois.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv) Executive further acknowledges and agrees that due to the uniqueness
of his services and confidential nature of the Confidential Information
he or she possesses, the covenants set forth herein are reasonable and
necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of United.&nbsp;
Executive understands that it is United's intent to have this promise of
confidentiality enforced to its fullest extent.&nbsp; Accordingly, Executive
and United agree that, if any portion of this promise of confidentiality
is unenforceable, the court should still construe and enforce this promise
of confidentiality to the fullest extent permitted by law.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive agrees to keep the terms of and circumstances surrounding this
Agreement and of his or her working arrangement, as defined herein, confidential
except that the source and amount of his or her income may be revealed
as necessary for tax, loan purposes and the like.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Executive agrees not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation
or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly
or indirectly) that (a) accuses or implies that United and/or any of its
parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, together with their respective present
or former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, employees and agents,
and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, engaged in any
wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive's
employment (or the termination thereof), the business or operations of
United, or otherwise; or (b) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects
adversely upon the business or reputation of United and/or any of its parents,
subsidiaries and affiliates, together with their respective present or
former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, employees and agents,
and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
United agrees not to willfully authorize any statement, observation or
opinion (whether oral or written, direct or indirect) that is materially
injurious to Executive and that (a) accuses or implies that Executive engaged
in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct relating to Executive's employment
with United or (b) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely
upon the reputation of Executive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Executive or United from providing
truthful testimony or information pursuant to subpoena, court order or
similar legal process.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of Employees</u>:&nbsp; Executive agrees that Executive will not, during
the Term, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of any Competitor (as
defined in Paragraph 4(B) hereof) of United, solicit the employment or
services of, hire, or assist in the hiring of any person eligible for the
Performance Incentive Plan or any successor Plan.
<blockquote>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Assent and Release</u>.</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
consideration for the payments and benefits provided in this Agreement,

<dir>
<dir>

Executive will receive compensation beyond that which he was already entitled

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
entering into this Agreement;
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive has been advised
by United to consult with an attorney before signing this Agreement;
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive was given a copy
of this Agreement on or before February 20, 2003.&nbsp; Executive has been
informed that Executive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
has not less than twenty-one (21) days from February 20, 2003 within which
to consider the Agreement and, if Executive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
considers this Agreement for fewer than 21 days, then Executive agrees
that he has had a reasonable period of time to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consider the Agreement; and
<p>&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive was informed that Executive

and irrevocable unless written
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
revocation is received by the undersigned from Executive on or before the
close of business on the seventh (7th) day after
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive
executed this Agreement.&nbsp; If Executive revokes this Agreement it shall
not be effective or enforceable and Executive will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not receive
the compensation or benefits described in this Agreement.</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Waiver
of Unknown Claims</u>:&nbsp; It is the intention of Executive and United
in executing this Agreement that the same shall be effective as a bar to
each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified.&nbsp;
In furtherance of this intention, Executive hereby expressly waives any
and all rights and benefits conferred upon Executive by the provisions
of SECTION 1542 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, to the extent applicable

full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and
provisions, including as well those related to unknown and unsuspected
claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as well as those relating
to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified.&nbsp;
SECTION 1542 provides:
<dir>
<dir>"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT
WITH THE DEBTOR."</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive and UA acknowledge that
Executive and UA may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to
or different from those which Executive and UA now knows or believes to
exist with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and which, if
known or suspected at the time of executing this Agreement, may have materially
affected this settlement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UA and UAL together with their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates,
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives,

and assigns hereby expressly release Executive from any an all charges,
complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, causes
of action, rights, costs, losses, debts, and expenses of any nature whatsoever,
known or unknown, which UA or UAL ever had, now has or hereafter can, shall

this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid provisions
or application in accordance with the essential intent and purpose of this
Agreement, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared
to be severable.&nbsp; Moreover, if any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Supersedes
Prior Agreement(s)</u>.&nbsp; This Agreement supersedes and voids any prior
oral or written agreement relating in any way to Executive's employment

Mitigation</u>.&nbsp; United agrees that Executive is not required to seek
other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable
to Executive by United pursuant to this Agreement.&nbsp; Furthermore, the

by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount
claimed to be owed by Executive to United, or otherwise.

further agrees that United may seek temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief to enforce the provisions contained in Paragraph 6, without
first proceeding to arbitration.
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Representations by United</u>.&nbsp;
