Pursuant to a Membership Interests Purchase Agreement by and between Tomen Power Corporation ("<B><I>TPC</B></I>") and Fort Point Power LLC ("<B><I>FPP</B></I>") dated as of July 1, 2002, as amended, FPP purchased TPC's membership interests in TPC Funding LLC ("<B><I>Funding</B></I>"), which held stock in TPC Cottage Grove, Inc. ("<B><I>TPC Cottage Grove</B></I>"), the effect of which was to indirectly transfer TPC Cottage Grove to FPP (the "<B><I>Transaction</B></I>").  The Transaction closed on September 4, 2002.<BR>
