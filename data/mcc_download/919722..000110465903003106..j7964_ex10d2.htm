the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to such conversion.&#160; For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note
with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but
shall exclude the number of shares of Company Common Stock which would be
issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this

or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other

shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<b><font style="font-weight:bold;">1934 Act</font></b>&#148;).&#160; For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the
number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as reflected in (x) the
Company&#146;s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more
recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the
Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding.&#160; Upon the
written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within two Business
Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding.&#160;
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of
securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock was reported.</font></p>
