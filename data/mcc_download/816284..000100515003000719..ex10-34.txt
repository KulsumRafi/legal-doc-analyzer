                       PRICE, ORDERS, AND TERMS OF PAYMENT
                       -----------------------------------

4.01 Price. The prices of the Product will be determined in the manner set forth
in Exhibit B to this Agreement. The prices will be subject to adjustment in the
manner set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement.

4.02 Projections. CELGENE shall issue at quarterly intervals a twelve (12) month
forecast estimating its total requirements of Product from SIEGFRIED. SIEGFRIED
will use these forecasts for planning purposes only, unless and until such time
as CELGENE issues a firm purchase order for delivery of Product. If during any
quarter, the quantity set forth in firm purchase orders requested by CELGENE
exceeds the most recent forecast provided for such quarter by more than thirty
percent (30%), SIEGFRIED shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
accommodate the excess quantity of Product which CELGENE shall request under
such purchase orders.

4.03 Purchase Orders. CELGENE shall submit firm purchase orders for quantities
of Product desired to SIEGFRIED at its address designated in Section 11.05
hereof. Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantities of Product to be
purchased, the delivery dates and shipping instructions and place of delivery,
and shall allow maximum six (6) months for delivery. SIEGFRIED shall have ten
(10) business days to accept the purchase order, which shall become firm upon
acceptance. In the event SIEGFRIED cannot meet the quantity or dates specified,
it shall notify CELGENE, and the parties shall in good faith negotiate a
mutually satisfactory schedule, at which point such negotiated schedule shall
become part of the firm purchase order. Each purchase order issued hereunder
shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, and none of the terms or
conditions of CELGENE's or SIEGFRIED's forms shall be applicable, except for
those specifying quantity ordered, delivery dates, special supply and packing
instructions, and invoice instruction.

4.04 Payment Terms. SIEGFRIED shall invoice CELGENE when analytical testing
release against Specification, and satisfactory Manufacturing Batch Record
review have completed, and net payment for the Product shall be due to SIEGFRIED
not later than forty-five (45) days from the date of invoice of Product by
SIEGFRIED. All payments and communications regarding the Product shall be
delivered to SIEGFRIED at the address designated in Section 11.05 hereof. If
Product is damaged or destroyed prior to delivery to a common carrier specified
by CELGENE, CELGENE shall be entitled to reimbursement from SIEGFRIED for any
amounts paid to SIEGFRIED in respect of such Product.

4.05 Cover. If SIEGFRIED fails to timely deliver to CELGENE the quantity of
Product that CELGENE orders under any firm purchase order pursuant to Section
4.03, then after providing written notice to SIEGFRIED and the failure of
SIEGFRIED to cure within ten (10) business days, such purchase order shall be
deemed to be cancelled to the extent of the quantity of Product SIEGFRIED failed
to deliver, CELGENE may purchase Product from another manufacturer in
substitution for the quantity of Product SIEGFRIED failed to deliver and such
quantity shall be deemed to have been purchased from SIEGFRIED for purposes of
<PAGE>


satisfying the requirements of Section 2.01 hereof relating to 50% of CELGENE's
annual requirements. Provided such quantity that SIEGFRIED has failed to deliver
does not, together with other quantities of Product ordered during such quarter,
does not exceed the most recent forecast provided by CELGENE with respect to
such quarter by more than thirty percent (30%), SIEGFRIED shall reimburse
CELGENE upon receipt by SIEGFRIED of receipts or other suitable substantiation
for the difference between the cost of obtaining such Product from another
manufacturer (plus reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred by
CELGENE in connection therewith), less the price that would have been due to
SIEGFRIED for the like quantity, had it been supplied by SIEGFRIED hereunder.

time of delivery to the carrier.

5.02 Inspection. CELGENE may, at its expense, inspect and test each shipment of
the Product delivered by SIEGFRIED under this Agreement. For a period of thirty
(30) days after receipt of each shipment of Product and Manufacturing Batch
Record hereunder, CELGENE shall have the right to return such shipment to
SIEGFRIED if CELGENE determines that the Product does not conform to the
Specifications, or thirty (30) business days from the receipt of the
Manufacturing Batch Record for failure to comply with cGMP, whichever is later.
SIEGFRIED shall provide CELGENE with accurate copies of each Manufacturing Batch
Record . Product will be deemed accepted by CELGENE upon final release by
CELGENE's Quality Assurance Department , no later than sixty (60) days after
receipt of the Product sold hereunder; provided, however, in the case of Product
having latent defects, which upon diligent examination in accordance with the
quality control testing procedures set out in the Specifications upon receipt
could not have been discovered. In such event CELGENE shall provide written
notice to SIEGFRIED prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period,
setting forth the details of such non-conformity. Any non-conforming product
returned to SIEGFRIED shall be at SIEGFRIED's expense and shall be returned by
CELGENE in the manner specified by SIEGFRIED. SIEGFRIED shall, at its expense
and discretion, either replace the batch of non-conforming Product within sixty
(60) days after SIEGFRIED receives the above mentioned written notice, or refund
or credit the pro-rata portion of the amount due SIEGFRIED under Section 4.01
within such sixty (60) day period. Disputes between the parties as to whether
all or any part of a shipment rejected by CELGENE conforms to the Specifications
shall be resolved by a mutually acceptable third party testing laboratory within
thirty (30) days after SIEGFRIED advises CELGENE that it disputes the asserted
non-conformity. SIEGFRIED shall pay all expenses of third party testing if
Product does not conform to the Product Specifications according to such third
<PAGE>


party and CELGENE shall pay all expenses of third party if Product does conform
to the Product Specifications according to such third party.

5.03 Label and Packaging. SIEGFRIED shall label and package Product in
accordance with the Specifications as defined in Exhibit A. The label and
packaging specifications may be modified from time to time by mutual agreement
of the parties. Additionally, CELGENE shall have the right to revise the label

SIEGFRIED for the purpose of complying with any FDA or other regulatory
requirement at its own cost and expense. SIEGFRIED shall not have any right,
title or interest in the Focalin(R) trademark, tradedress or any other trade
name or trademark under which Product is resold by CELGENE. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, CELGENE grants to SIEGFRIED an irrevocable license for the term of
this Agreement to use all the patents, trademarks and tradedress required for
SIEGFRIED to fulfill the terms of this Agreement.

         (30) days prior written notice. CELGENE shall provide SIEGFRIED with
         evidence of such insurance and/or self-insurance program, upon request.

6.09 Limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any claim by one
party against the other arising out of the performance or failure of performance
of the other party under this Agreement, the parties expressly agree that the
liability of such party to the other party for such breach shall be limited
under this Agreement or otherwise at law or equity to direct damages only and in
no event shall a party be liable in respect of any such claims for punitive,
exemplary, incidental, special or consequential damages.

                      -------------------------------------

7.01 Product Return Procedures.

     (a) CELGENE may return to SIEGFRIED, at SIEGFRIED's shipping expense and

<PAGE>


         SIEGFRIED within sixty (60) days of receipt. Credit for returned items
         shall be given when SIEGFRIED receives Product.

     (b) Subject to Section 5.02, no such return may be made unless CELGENE
         first receives written authorization for the return from SIEGFRIED,
         which such authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld, and such
         return is then made in accordance with such authorization.

     (c) Shipping costs for shipment of replacement Product by SIEGFRIED back to
         the location designated by Purchaser via ground transportation shall be
         paid by SIEGFRIED.

     (d) SIEGFRIED shall have no obligation to grant credit for or replace any
         Product sold hereunder which has been subject to misuse, mishandling,
         neglect, accident, or abuse by any person other than SIEGFRIED or has
         been subjected to alteration or modifications by any person other than
         SIEGFRIED.

7.02 Recalls.

     (a) If any government authority requires a recall, or if CELGENE reasonably
         determines a voluntary recall is warranted, of any product sold by
         CELGENE which includes the Product (the "Recalled Product") due to a
         failure of the Product to meet Specifications or otherwise comply with
         SIEGFRIED's warranties herein, CELGENE shall immediately notify
         SIEGFRIED of such recall by phone and confirm in writing within
         forty-eight (48) hours.

     (b) Prior to commencing any recall, described in Section 7.02 (a), CELGENE
         shall inform SIEGFRIED of the proposed manner in which the recall is to
         be carried out.

     (c) If the recall results from any circumstances described in clauses (i),
         (ii), or (iii) of Section 6.05 hereof, SIEGFRIED shall:

               (i) Credit to CELGENE an amount equal to the purchase price paid
                   by CELGENE to SIEGFRIED for the Product so recalled plus
                   CELGENE's actual cost for direct material and direct labor
                   furnished by it or it's contracting parties in connection
                   with the manufacture of the Recalled Product and reimburse
                   CELGENE for the reasonable expenses of conducting its recall
                   action (e.g. advertising, mailing, etc.);

              (ii) Indemnify and hold CELGENE harmless from and against any and
                   all damages, costs or charges, lawsuits or expenses
                   associated with or resulting from any such recall, including
                   reasonable counsel fees and disbursements.
<PAGE>


     (d) If the recall results from (i) a defect in handling of the Product
         after shipment by SIEGFRIED or in shipping or storing Product (after
         delivery to the carrier specified by CELGENE), (ii) the failure of the
         Product manufactured in accordance with the Specifications to comply
         with the levels of performance, quality, fitness or durability
         warranted or represented by CELGENE, (iii) a defect arising out of any
         Specifications mandated by CELGENE, (iv) the inadequate or misleading
         nature of any text appearing on the packaging or labeling of the
         Product in compliance with the Specifications, and (v) any other reason
         not set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 6.05 hereof
         including CELGENE's failure to recall any product containing Product
         after notice from SIEGFRIED that a recall is warranted (in which case
         SIEGFRIED shall have no liability whatsoever, notwithstanding anything
         herein to the contrary), CELGENE hereby indemnifies and holds SIEGFRIED
         harmless from any damages, costs, charges, lawsuits, or reasonable
         expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incurred by or
         imposed upon SIEGFRIED associated with or resulting from any such
         recall.

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY
                                 ---------------

8.01 Confidential Information. Each of SIEGFRIED and CELGENE shall use any
Confidential Information disclosed to it by or on behalf of the other party only
for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and shall not disclose such
Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of
the other party. The foregoing obligations shall survive the expiration or
termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years. These obligations
shall not apply to Confidential Information that:

     (i)    is known by the receiving party at the time of its receipt, and not
            through a prior disclosure by the disclosing party, as documented by
            business records that pre-date disclosure by the disclosing party;

     (ii)   is at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, published or
            otherwise part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement
            by the receiving party;

     (iii)  is subsequently disclosed to the receiving party by a third party
            that has the right to make such disclosure;

     (iv)   is independently developed by the receiving party or its Affiliates
            without the aid, application or use of the disclosing party's
            Confidential Information, and such independent development can be
            documented by the receiving party;

     (v)    is disclosed to any institutional review board of any entity
            conducting clinical trials involving the Product or to any
            governmental or other regulatory agencies in order to obtain patents
            or to gain approval to conduct clinical trials or to market the
<PAGE>


            Product, provided that such disclosure may be made only to the
            extent reasonably necessary for such purposes; or

     (vi)   is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, rule, act or order
            of any governmental authority or agency or by judicial process,
            provided that notice is promptly delivered to the other party in
            order to provide an opportunity to seek a protective order or other
            similar order with respect to such Confidential Information and
            thereafter the receiving party discloses to the requesting person
            only the minimum information required to be disclosed in order to
            comply with the request, whether or not a protective order or other
            similar order is obtained by the other party.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
                          ----------------------------

9.01 Rights to Product and Material. Each Party shall continue to have sole
ownership of and the right to exploit its own know-how, trade secrets and other
intellectual property rights. This Article VIII survives the termination or
expiration of this Agreement

                                    ARTICLE X
                                   TERMINATION
                                   -----------

10.01 Early Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement as follows:

     (a) By one party immediately upon written notice to the other, if the other
         party files a petition in bankruptcy, or enters into an arrangement
         with or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or
         applies for or consents to the appointment of a receiver or trustee for
         it or any of its assets, or suffers or permits the entry of an order
         adjudicating it to be bankrupt or insolvent (each an "Insolvency
         Event").

     (b) By one party if the other party fails to perform or otherwise breaches
         any of its representations, warranties and covenants or any material
         obligations hereunder, by giving the breaching party written notice of
         its intent to terminate and stating the grounds therefor. The party
         receiving such notice shall have sixty (60) days from the receipt
         thereof if such breach or failure involves a non-monetary obligation,
         and thirty (30) days if the breach or failure is regarding a monetary
         obligation relating to conforming Product, to cure the failure or
         breach, at which time this agreement shall terminate if such failure or
         breach has not been cured. In no event, however, shall such termination
         notice be deemed to waive any rights to damages or any other remedy,
         which the party giving notice of breach may have as a consequence of
         such failure or breach.
<PAGE>


10.02 Effect of Termination. The expiration or early termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve the parties of any obligation accruing prior to such
expiration or termination, and the provisions of Sections 2.02, 2.03, 2.05,
2.08, and 5.03 and Articles VI, VII, VIII and IX hereof shall survive the
expiration or early termination of this Agreement.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS
                               ------------------

11.01 Force Majeure. Failure of any party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement shall not subject such party to any liability or place them in breach
of any term or condition of this Agreement to the other party if such failure is
due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of such non-performing party
("force majeure"), unless conclusive evidence to the contrary is provided.
Causes of non-performance constituting force majeure shall include, without
limitation, acts of God, fire, explosion, flood, drought, war, riot, sabotage,
embargo, strikes or other labor trouble, failure in whole or in part of
suppliers to deliver on schedule materials, interruption of or delay in
transportation, a national health emergency or compliance with any order or
regulation of any government entity acting with color of right. The party
affected shall promptly notify the other party of the condition constituting
force majeure as defined herein and shall exert commercially reasonable efforts
to eliminate, cure and overcome any such causes and to resume performance of its
obligations with all possible speed; provided that nothing herein shall obligate
a party to settle on terms unsatisfactory to such party any strike, lockout or
other labor difficulty, any investigation or other proceeding by any public
authority or any litigation by any third party. If a condition constituting
force majeure as defined herein exists for more than ninety (90) consecutive
days, the parties shall meet to negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution to
the problem, if practicable.

11.02 Assignment. Neither party shall, without the prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the other party having been obtained,
assign or transfer this Agreement to any person or entity, in whole or in part,
provided that, each party may assign or transfer this Agreement to any Affiliate
or to any successor by merger of such party or its pharmaceutical business to
which this Agreement relates, or upon a sale of all or substantially all of such
parties assets, or the assets of its pharmaceutical business to which this
Agreement relates, and provided further that Celgene may assign this Agreement
to Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, in each case, without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto. All of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

11.03 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Quality Agreement
(Exhibit C hereto), shall constitute the entire Agreement between the parties
hereto and shall supersede any other agreements, whether oral or written,
express or implied, as they pertain to the Product. This Agreement may not be
changed or modified except by written instrument signed by both parties.
<PAGE>


11.04 Independent Relationship. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
create an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between
the parties hereto or any of their agents or employees, or any other legal
arrangement that would impose liability upon one party for the act or failure to
act of the other party. Neither party shall have any power to enter into any
contracts or commitments or to incur any liabilities in the name of, or on
behalf of, the other party, or to bind the other party in any respect
whatsoever.

11.06 Waiver. Any delay or failure in enforcing a party's rights under this

unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such

hereof. The parties shall consult and use good faith efforts to agree upon a
valid and enforceable provision, which shall be a reasonable substitute for such
invalid provision in light of the intent of this Agreement.

11.10 Resolution of Dispute. Any claim or controversy arising hereunder shall
first be submitted to mediation and, if not settled during mediation, shall
thereafter be submitted to binding arbitration as provided by the Federal

                                    ---------

                                 PRODUCT PRICES

The initial prices of the Product are as follows:

The price for the initial order of 1,000 kilogram of Product is Four Thousand
Seven Hundred Eighty Dollars ($4,780.00 USD) per kilogram.

Thereafter, the price for purchase orders quantities of less than 1,000 kilogram
shall be Four Thousand Four Hundred Eighty Dollars ($4,480.00 USD) per kilogram.
The price for purchase order quantities of more than 1,000 kilogram shall be
Four Thousand One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($4,120.00 USD) per kilogram. The
foregoing shall serve as Base Prices for adjustment purposes.

PRICE REVISION:

The Base Price will be subject to an annual adjustment, commencing on January 1,
2004. The Base Price will be adjusted upward or downward each year based upon
the change in the Producer Price Index for Chemical and Allied Products (PPI -
WPU06) base value, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Labor. The parties agree that the PPI factor adjustment will begin
at the average for July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 at 149.3.

The calculation of the adjusted Product price is as follows:

         Price200(alpha) = Base Price + PPI Escalation
         PPI Escalation = Base Price X (PPI200(alpha) /149.3)
