         5.   Amendment to Credit Agreement. (a) Upon the effectiveness of this
  Amendment, each reference in the Credit Agreement to "Credit Agreement,"
  "Agreement," the prefix "herein," "hereof," or words of similar import, and
  each reference in the Loan Documents to the Credit Agreement, shall mean and
  be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby. (b) Except as
  modified herein, all of the representations, warranties, terms, covenants and
  conditions of the Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents and all other
  agreements executed in connection therewith shall remain as written originally
  and in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, and
  nothing herein shall affect, modify, limit or impair any of the rights and
  powers which the Lenders and the Administrative Agent may have thereunder. The
  amendment set forth herein shall be limited precisely as provided for herein,
  and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of, amendment of, consent to or
  modification of any of the rights of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent
  under or of any other term or provisions of the Credit Agreement, any Loan
  Document, or other agreement executed in connection therewith, or of any term
  or provision of any other instrument referred to therein or herein or of any
  transaction or future action on the part of the Company which would require
  the consent of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, including, without
  limitation, waivers of Events of Default which may exist after giving effect
  hereto. The Company ratifies and confirms each term, provision, condition and
  covenant set forth in the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents and
  acknowledges that the agreements set forth therein continue to be legal, valid
  and binding agreements, and enforceable in accordance with their respective
  terms.

         6.   Authority. The Company hereby represents and warrants to the
  Administrative Agent and the Lenders that (a) the Company has legal power and
  authority to execute and deliver the within Amendment; (b) the officer
  executing the within Amendment on behalf of the Company has been duly
  authorized to execute and deliver the same and bind the Company with respect
  to the provisions provided for herein; (c) the execution and delivery hereof
  by the Company and the performance and observance by the Company of the
  provisions hereof do not violate or conflict with the articles of
  incorporation or code of regulations of the Company or any law applicable to
  the Company or result in the breach of any provision of or constitute a
  default under any agreement, instrument or document binding upon or
  enforceable against the Company; and (d) this Amendment constitutes a valid
  and legally binding obligation upon the Company in every respect.

         7.   Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two or more
  counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an
  original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
  document. Separate counterparts may be executed with the same effect as if all
  parties had executed the same counterparts.

         8.   Costs and Expenses. The Company agrees to pay on demand in
  accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement all reasonable costs and
  expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
  reproduction, execution and delivery of this Amendment and all other loan
  documents entered into in connection herewith, including the
