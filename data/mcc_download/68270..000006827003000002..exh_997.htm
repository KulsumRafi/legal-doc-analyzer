employment following a Change of Control or in the event the Company terminates the
Executive&#146;s employment other than for Cause, this Agreement shall terminate and the
Company shall have no further obligations hereunder except as follows: (a) immediate

payment of a lump sum amount equal to the product of three (3), multiplied by the sum of
(i) Base Salary then in effect, plus (ii) the greater of (A) the target annual bonus for
the fiscal year in which the Qualified Termination or involuntary termination other than
for Cause occurs, or (B) the average of the last three annual bonuses earned by the
Executive; (c) immediate payment of a pro rata portion of the target annual bonus for the
fiscal year in which the Qualified Termination or involuntary termination other than for
Cause occurs; (d) the payment of earned but unused vacation through the end of the
calendar month in which such termination occurs; and (e) the provision of health, life and
disability coverages to the Executive and eligible dependents for a period of thirty-six
(36) months at active employee rates (or cash equal to the cost of any such coverage to
the extent such continued coverage can not be provided pursuant to any underlying
insurance policy then in effect or where such continued coverage would have adverse tax
effects to the Executive or other plan participants). Payment of obligations under any
other employee benefit plans shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of
those plans; provided, however, that the Executive&#146;s accrued benefit under the Ruby
Tuesday, Inc. Executive Supplemental Pension Plan shall be determined by increasing the
Executive&#146;s actual years of &#147;Continuous Service&#148; (as defined therein) by an
additional three (3) full years. </FONT>

<TD WIDTH=80%><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the aggregate amount provided
for in this Agreement and any other payments and benefits which the Executive has the
right to receive from the Company and its Affiliates (determined without regard to the
provisions of this paragraph) would subject the Executive to an excise tax under Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor federal tax law), or any interest or
penalties are incurred or paid by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (any such
excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), then the Executive shall be entitled to an
additional payment from the Company as is necessary (after taking into account all
federal, state and local taxes (regardless of type, whether income, excise or otherwise)
imposed upon the Executive as a result of the receipt of the payment contemplated by this
Agreement) to place the Executive in the same after-tax position the Executive would have
been in had no Excise Tax been imposed or incurred or paid by the Executive. Ernst &amp;
Young LLP (or its successor) or any other certified public accounting firm agreed to by
the Company and the Executive shall determine the extent, if any, of the Company&#146;s
obligations pursuant to this paragraph after receipt of notice from either the Company or
the Executive that a payment has been made that may subject the Executive to the Excise
Tax. The accounting firm shall make its determination within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of any such notice. The Company shall pay to the Executive in cash in a lump sum
any amount that the accounting firm determines is due pursuant to this paragraph not later
than five (5) business days prior to the date that the Executive must file the
Executive&#146;s federal income tax return which reflects the payment that subjects the
Executive to the Excise Tax.&#148; </FONT>
