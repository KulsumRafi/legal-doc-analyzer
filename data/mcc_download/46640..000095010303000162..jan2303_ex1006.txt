Contributions of the Partners as provided above in Section 4.01 hereof, if at

connection with the operations of the Partnership or any SPV, and/or (iii) to

both operating and capital expenditures of the Partnership or any SPV, the
General Partner may (but shall not be obligated to) request that the Partners
make further capital contributions in an amount sufficient to fund such
Shortfall in return for an interest in the Partnership as reasonably determined
by the General Partner. Alternatively, the General Partner may offer interests
to Persons who are not Partners on such terms as the General Partner determines
reasonable but shall first offer such interests to the Partners.

the Partnership (as the case may be), in each case upon such terms, conditions
and provisions as determined appropriate by the General Partner and approved by

                                      13
<PAGE>


case, this Agreement may be amended in such form as reasonably approved by the
General Partner for the purpose of (a) admitting such new Class A Interest
Holders and/or Class B Interest Holders, (b) setting forth or describing in
reasonable detail, accepting and valuing, the assets to be contributed by such
new Class A Interest Holders and/or Class B Interest Holders, (c) amending
Schedules A and B of this Agreement as necessary and (d) otherwise amending
this Agreement (as determined appropriate by the General Partner) to reflect
such Additional Admissions. In connection with any such Additional Admission,
the General Partner is authorized (on behalf of the Partnership and any
applicable SPV) to enter into any and all agreements, contracts, documents and
other instruments relating to or to effectuate such Additional Admission and
the related contribution of business operations and/or assets (in each case,
upon such terms, conditions and provisions as determined appropriate by the
General Partner) and the General Partner is authorized to execute appropriate
amendments to this Agreement on behalf of the other Limited Partners pursuant
to Section 10.05 hereof.

of the Partnership (and on behalf of any one or more SPV) contributions to the
capital of the Partnership from existing Partners, in exchange for either new
or additional Class A Interests and/or Class B Interests in the Partnership (as
the case may be), in each case upon such terms, conditions and provisions as
determined appropriate by the General Partner and approved by the Management
Board (including assumptions of liabilities of the type described in Section

reasonably approved by the General Partner for the purpose of (a) reflecting
such new or additional Class A Interests and/or Class B Interests, (b) amending
Schedules A and B of this Agreement as necessary and (c) otherwise amending
this Agreement (as determined appropriate by the General Partner) to reflect
such additional Capital Contributions and acquisitions of Properties. In
connection with any such transaction, the General Partner is authorized (on
behalf of the Partnership and any applicable SPV) to enter into any and all
agreements, contracts, documents and other instruments relating to or to
effectuate such additional Capital Contributions and Property acquisitions (in
each case, upon such terms, conditions and provisions as determined appropriate
by the General Partner) and the General Partner is authorized to execute
appropriate amendments to this Agreement on behalf of the other Limited
Partners pursuant to Section 10.05 hereof.

     4.05. CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. A separate capital account ("Capital Account")
will be maintained for each Partner in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and consistent therewith shall be increased by all
increases required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)
and shall be decreased by all decreases required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and any other elective adjustments to capital accounts under
such Treasury Regulations deemed appropriate by the General Partner to properly
reflect the economic interests of the Partners (unless such elective adjustment
is otherwise required under this Agreement). The foregoing provisions and the
other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital
Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b),
and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury
Regulations. In the event the General Partner shall determine that it is
prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or
credits thereto


                                      14
<PAGE>


(including, without limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities which
are secured by contributed or distributed Property or which are assumed by the
Partnership or any Partners), are computed in order to comply with such
Treasury Regulations, the General Partner may make such modification, provided
that it is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the amounts
distributed to any person pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof.

     4.06. NO FURTHER CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement (including with regard to Additional Admissions, acquisitions of
additional Properties) or with the prior written consent of all the Partners,
no Partner shall be required or entitled to contribute any other or further
capital to the Partnership, nor shall any Partner be required or entitled to
loan any funds to the Partnership. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained herein will, or is intended or
will be deemed to benefit any creditor of the Partnership or any creditor of
any Partner, and no such creditor will have any rights, interests or claims
hereunder, be entitled to any benefits hereunder or be entitled to require the
Partnership or any Partner to demand, solicit or accept any loan, advance or
additional capital contribution for or to the Partnership or to enforce any
right which the Partnership or any Partner may have against any other Partner
or which any Partner may have against the Partnership, pursuant to this

     5.02. WAIVER OF PARTITION; NATURE OF INTERESTS IN THE PARTNERSHIP. Except

          (a) To cause the Partnership or any of its assets to be partitioned;

          (b) To cause the appointment of a receiver for all or any portion of
     the assets of the Partnership;

          (c) To compel any sale of all or any portion of the assets of the
     Partnership pursuant to any applicable law; or

          (d) To file a complaint, or to institute any proceeding at law or in
     equity, to cause the termination, dissolution or liquidation of the
     Partnership.

Each of the Partners has been induced to enter into this Agreement in reliance
upon the waivers set forth in this Section 5.02, and without such waivers no
Partner would have entered into this


                                      15
<PAGE>


Agreement. No Partner shall have any interest in any specific Property. The
interests of all Partners in this Partnership are personal property.


VI.  DISTRIBUTIONS

     6.01. DISTRIBUTIONS OF OPERATING CASH FLOW. Operating Cash Flow for each
Fiscal Year shall be distributed to the Partners in the following order of
priority:

          (a) first, 95% to the Class B Interest Holders, 4% to the Class A
     Interest Holders and 1% to the General Partner until the Class B Interest
     Holders have received aggregate distributions for such Fiscal Year
     pursuant to this Section 6.01(a) and Section 6.03(a)(i) in an amount equal
     to 90% of the Preferred Return Amount for such Fiscal Year;

          (b) second, 50% to the Class B Interest Holders, 49% to the Class A
     Interest Holders and 1% to the General Partner until the Class B Interest
     Holders have received aggregate distributions pursuant to Section 6.03(a),
     Section 6.01(a) and this Section 6.01(b) for such Fiscal Year in an amount
     equal to the Preferred Return Amount for such Fiscal Year;

          (c) third, to the Partners pro rata in proportion to the balances in
     their respective Investment Income Accounts to the extent thereof; and

          (d) thereafter, to the Partners in accordance with their respective
     Sharing Ratios.

     6.02. DISTRIBUTION TRUE UP. The Partners recognize that due to variations
in the Index Rate and/or the amount of Operating Cash Flow and/or Capital
Proceeds available for distribution during the Fiscal Year, and since
distributions pursuant to Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 may be made more often
than annually (as provided in Section 6.06 hereof), the aggregate amount of
Operating Cash Flow and/or Capital Proceeds received by the Partners on a
quarterly or other interim basis may not be the amount to which they would
otherwise be entitled to on an annual basis under Section 6.01 and Section 6.03
for a Fiscal Year (the amount each such Partner is to receive on an annual
basis pursuant to Sections 6.01 and 6.03 hereof for each Fiscal Year is herein
sometimes referred to as the "Proper Amount"), and as a result thereof, the
General Partner may adjust any distributions to the Partners (including fourth
Quarter distributions and annual distributions) and among the Partners for such
Fiscal Year so as to cause the aggregate amount received by each Partner for
such Fiscal Year to equal such Partner's Proper Amount. In the event such
fourth Quarter or annual adjusting distributions are insufficient to cause the
aggregate amounts received by each such Partner for such Fiscal Year to equal
their respective Proper Amount, the General Partner may require the return of
some or all of the amounts previously distributed to one or more of the
Partners for such Fiscal Year, and if necessary, distribute such amounts to
other Partners, so as to cause the aggregate amounts received by each of the
Partners for such Fiscal Year (after such adjustments, returns and
redistributions) to equal the applicable Proper Amount. The General Partner
shall notify the Partners of the necessity for


                                      16
<PAGE>


any such adjustment and the appropriate adjustment as to each Partner. Any
Partner receiving a request for return of any quarterly or other interim
distribution, as provided above, shall promptly return such amount to the
Partnership, and if necessary to balance the Proper Amount for each Partner,
the Partnership shall promptly thereafter distribute some or all of such amount
to one or more of the other Partners, so as to cause the aggregate amounts
received by each of the Partners to equal the applicable Proper Amount.

     6.03. DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL PROCEEDS. Capital Proceeds shall be
distributed in the following order of priority:

          (a) first, to the Partners in the following order of priority:

               (i) first, 95% to the Class B Interest Holders, 4% to the Class
          A Interest Holders and 1% to the General Partner until the Class B
          Interest Holders have received aggregate distributions for such
          Fiscal Year pursuant to this Section 6.03(a)(i) and Section 6.01(a)
          in an amount equal to 90% of the Preferred Return Amount for such
          Fiscal Year;

               (ii) thereafter, 50% to the Class B Interest Holders, 49% to the
          Class A Interest Holders and 1% to the General Partner until the
          Class B Interest Holders have received aggregate distributions for
          the Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 6.03(a), Section 6.01(a) and
          Section 6.01(b) for such Fiscal Year in an amount equal to the
          Preferred Return Amount for such Fiscal Year.

          (b) second, to the Partners pro rata in proportion to the balances in
     their respective Investment Income Accounts to the extent thereof;

          (c) third, 94% to the Class B Interest Holders, 1% to the General
     Partner and 5% to the Class A Interest Holders until the Adjusted
     Unrecovered Capital of each Class B Interest Holder is equal to zero; and

          (d) thereafter, to the Partners in proportion to their respective
     Sharing Ratios.

          (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the distribution of
     Capital Proceeds to a Partner under Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d)
     results in such Partner receiving Capital Proceeds in an amount that is
     less than such Partner's Deemed Tax Amount, then amounts otherwise
     distributable under Sections 6.03(c) and 6.03(d) shall instead be
     redistributed among the Partners in such a manner so as to ensure (with
     the least amount of economic change possible) that to the greatest extent
     possible, each Partner receives an amount under Sections 6.03(c) and
     6.03(d) that is no less than such Partner's Deemed Tax Amount. Any amounts
     otherwise distributable pursuant to Section 6.03(c) or Section 6.03(d) but
     instead distributed pursuant to this Section 6.03(e) (first as amounts
     otherwise distributable pursuant to Section 6.03(d) and then as to Section
     6.03(c)) in favor of a Partner ("Recipient Partner") and away from another
     Partner ("Forgoing Partner") shall be referred to herein as such Forgoing
     Partner's "Special Receipt Amount." Special Receipt Amounts shall be
     considered as advances by the Partnership against future distributions to
     such Recipient Partner and shall be recovered


                                      17
<PAGE>


     as rapidly as possible such that all future distributions of Capital
     Proceeds to such Recipient Partner shall instead be distributed pro rata
     to the Forgoing Partners (in proportion to their respective Special
     Receipt Amounts) until the Special Receipt Amount of each Forgoing Partner
     has been fully recovered.

     6.04. DISTRIBUTIONS IN LIQUIDATION. Upon the dissolution and winding-up of
the Partnership, the proceeds of sale and other assets of the Partnership
distributable to the Partners under Section 12.02(c)(iii) shall be distributed,
not later than the latest time specified for such distributions pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2) to the Partners in
proportion to and in accordance with their respective positive Capital Account
balances (after adjustment to reflect all adjustments to Capital Accounts other
than the distributions in liquidation). With the approval of the General
Partner, a pro rata portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made
to the Partners under the preceding sentence may be distributed to a trust
established for the benefit of the Partners for the purposes of liquidating
Partnership assets, collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any
contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership arising
out of or in connection with the Partnership. The assets of any trust
established under this Section 6.04 will be distributed to the Partners from
time to time by the trustee of the trust, upon approval of the General Partner,
in the same proportions as the amount distributed to the trust by the
Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the Partners under this
Agreement. Upon the liquidation of an interest in the Partnership not otherwise
in connection under the liquidation of the Partnership, the liquidating
distribution to any such Partner shall be in accordance with such Partner's
positive Capital Account balance after taking account of all adjustments to
Capital Accounts for the Taxable Year of liquidation (other than the
liquidating distribution).

     6.05. ALLOCATION AMONG PARTNERS. For purposes of this Article VI and for
purposes of Article VII:

          (a) Amounts distributed to the Class B Interest Holders pursuant to
     Sections 6.01(a), 6.01(b) and 6.03(a) shall be distributed among them
     based upon their relative Individual Preferred Return Amounts;

          (b) Amounts distributed to the Class B Interest Holders pursuant to
     Section 6.03(c) shall be distributed among them based upon their relative
     amounts of Unrecovered Capital; and

          (c) Except as otherwise provided or unless the context otherwise
     requires, all other amounts allocated or distributed to the Class B
     Interest Holders shall be allocated or distributed among them in
     proportion to their respective Percentage Interests and all other amounts
     allocated or distributed to the Class A Interest Holders shall be
     allocated or distributed among them in proportion to their respective
     Percentage Interests.

     6.06. TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS. As soon as reasonably practical after the
end of each Quarter (as determined by the General Partner) and prior to making
any distributions of Capital Proceeds arising from any Capital Event occurring
during such Quarter, the General Partner shall endeavor to determine Operating
Cash Flow for such Quarter and make distributions of Operating Cash Flow for
such Quarter, with annual adjusting distributions as soon as reasonably
practical after the end of the fourth Quarter of each Fiscal Year. The General
Partner shall make distributions of Capital Proceeds as soon as reasonably


                                      18
<PAGE>


practical after the receipt of the Capital Proceeds to be distributed and after
distributions of Operating Cash Flow, if any, for the Quarter during which the
Capital Event giving rise to such Capital Proceeds occurred.

VII. ALLOCATIONS

     7.01. OPERATING INCOME. For each Taxable Year, Operating Income shall be
allocated in the following order of priority:

          (a) first, to each Partner until the aggregate amount allocated to
     each such Partner (and any predecessor in interest) under this Section
     7.01(a) and under Section 7.04(a) for all prior and current periods is
     equal to the aggregate amount theretofore distributed for all prior and
     current periods to such Partner (and any predecessor in interest) pursuant
     to Sections 6.01(a), 6.01(b) and 6.03(a) hereof (as to each Partner the
     amount of such distributions in excess of such allocations being referred
     to herein as each such Partner's "Allocation Shortfall Amount") (and if
     there is insufficient Operating Income to make a full allocation under
     this Section 7.01(a), then pro rata to the Partners in proportion to their
     respective Allocation Shortfall Amounts); and

          (b) thereafter, to the Partners in accordance with their respective
     Sharing Ratios.

     7.02. INVESTMENT INCOME. For each Taxable Year, Investment Income shall be
allocated in the following order or priority:

          (a) first, 84% to the Class A Interest Holders, 1% to the General
     Partner and 15% to the Class B Interest Holders until the aggregate amount
     allocated under this Section 7.02(a) for such Taxable Year is equal to $10
     million; and

          (b) thereafter, 89% to the Class A Interest Holders, 1% to the
     General Partner and 10% to the Class B Interest Holders.

     7.03. OPERATING LOSS. For each Taxable Year, Operating Loss shall be
allocated 92% to the Class A Interest Holder, 7% to the Class B Interest
Holders and 1% to the General Partner.

     7.04. CAPITAL NET INCOME. For each Taxable Year, Capital Net Income shall
be allocated in the following order of priority:

          (a) first, to each Partner until the aggregate amount allocated to
     each such Partner (and any predecessor in interest) under this Section
     7.04(a) and under Section 7.01(a) for all prior and current periods is
     equal to the aggregate amount theretofore distributed for all prior and
     current periods to such Partner (and any predecessor in interest) pursuant
     to Sections 6.01(a), 6.01(b) and 6.03(a) hereof (as to each Partner, the
     amount of such distributions in excess of such allocations being referred
     to herein as each such Partner's "Capital Allocation Shortfall Amount")
     (and if there is insufficient Capital


                                      19
<PAGE>


     Net Income to make a full allocation under this Section 7.04(a), then pro
     rata to the Partners in proportion to their respective Capital Allocation
     Shortfall Amounts); and

          (b) thereafter, to the Partners in accordance with their respective
     Sharing Ratios.

     7.05. CAPITAL NET LOSSES. For each Taxable Year, Capital Net Losses shall
be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective Sharing
Ratios.

     7.06. WINDING UP INCOME AND LOSS. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Winding Up Income and Loss shall be allocated to make the
Partially Adjusted Capital Accounts of the Partners equal, as nearly as
possible, their respective Target Accounts.

     7.07. SPECIAL ALLOCATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 704(b). The
following special allocations shall, except as otherwise provided, be made in
the following order:

          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Article VII, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain or in
     any Partner Minimum Gain during any Taxable Year or other period, prior to
     any other allocation pursuant hereto, each Partner shall be specially
     allocated items of Partnership Income for such Taxable Year (and, if
     necessary, subsequent years) in an amount and manner required by Treasury
     Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f) or 1.704-2(i)(4). The items to be so
     allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.704-2.

          (b) Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other period shall
     be allocated (as nearly as possible) under Treasury Regulation Section
     1.704-2 to the Partners, pro rata in proportion to their respective
     Sharing Ratios.

          (c) Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other
     period shall be allocated to the Partner that made, or guaranteed or is
     otherwise liable with respect to the loan to which such Partner
     Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with principles
     under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i).

          (d) Any Partner who unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation
     or distribution described in Treasury Regulation Section
     1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) which causes or increases a negative
     balance in his or its Capital Account shall be allocated items of Income
     sufficient to eliminate such increase or negative balance caused thereby,
     as quickly as possible, to the extent required by such Treasury
     Regulation.

          (e) The allocations set forth in Sections 7.07(a), 7.07(b), 7.07(c)
     and 7.07(d) and Section 7.10(a) (the "Regulatory Allocations") are
     intended to comply with certain requirements of Treasury Regulation
     Sections 1.704-1 and 1.704-2. It is the intent of the Partners that, to
     the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either
     with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other
     items of Partnership Income and Loss, pursuant to this Section 7.07(e).
     Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII (other
     than the Regulatory Allocations), the General Partner shall make such
     offsetting special allocations of Partnership Income or Loss in whatever


                                      20
<PAGE>


     manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting
     allocations are made, each Partner's Capital Account balance is, to the
     extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Partner would
     have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of the Agreement and
     all Partnership items were allocated pursuant to Sections 7.01, 7.02,
     7.03, 7.04, 7.05 and 7.06. In exercising its discretion under this Section
     7.07(e), the General Partner shall take into account future Regulatory
     Allocations under Section 7.07(a) that, although not yet made, are likely
     to offset other Regulatory Allocations previously made under Sections
     7.07(b) and 7.07(c).

     7.08. TAX MATTERS. The Partners intend for the Partnership to be treated
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner shall
make all applicable elections, determinations and other decisions under the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, including, without limitation, the
deductibility of a particular item of expense and the positions to be taken on
the Partnership's tax return, and shall approve the settlement or compromise of
all audit matters raised by the Internal Revenue Service affecting the Partners
generally. The Partners shall each take reporting positions on their respective
federal, state and local income tax returns consistent with the positions
determined for the Partnership by the General Partner. The General Partner
shall cause all federal, state and local income and other tax returns to be
timely filed by the Partnership.

     7.09. TAX MATTERS PARTNER. The General Partner shall be the tax matters
partner within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (and for purposes
of any similar state, local or foreign law) and shall possess all rights,
obligations and duties of a tax matters partner under the Code. If it
determines that it is desirable to do so, the General Partner shall cause the
Partnership to make such elections as are necessary to be subject to the
unified partnership audit procedures set forth in Section 6221 et seq. of the
Code.

     7.10. SPECIAL ALLOCATION RULES.

          (a) No allocation of Net Loss, Loss or Capital Loss shall be made to
     any Partner if, as a result of such allocation, such Partner would have an
     Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. Any such disallowed allocation shall be
     made to the Partners entitled to receive such allocation in accordance
     with applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) of the Code in
     proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.

          (b) For any Taxable Year, allocations shall be made first pursuant to
     Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 before any allocations are made to pursuant
     to Sections 7.04 and 7.05.

     7.11. SECTION 704(c). In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and
the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, deduction
and tax depreciation with respect to any property contributed to the capital of
the Partnership, shall, solely for federal income tax purposes, be allocated
among the Partners so as to take into account any variation between the
adjusted tax basis of such property to the Partnership and the initial Book
Basis of such property under such method (allowable under Section 704(c)) as
determined appropriate by the General Partner. In the event the Book Basis of
any Partner asset is adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (b) of the definition of
Book Basis, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss deduction and tax
depreciation with respect to such asset shall, solely for federal income tax


                                      21
<PAGE>


purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take into account any
variation between the adjusted tax basis of such asset and the Book Basis of
such asset in the same manner as under Section 704(c) of the Code utilizing
such method (allowable under Section 704(c)) as determined appropriate by the
General Partner. All allocations pursuant to this Section 7.11 are solely for
federal income tax purposes and shall not be taken into account in determining
any Partner's Capital Account, or determining Income or Loss.

     7.12. SHARING OF NONRECOURSE DEBT. For purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-3(a)(3) the Partners' shares of "partnership profits" shall be
the Sharing Ratios as among the Class A Interest Holders, as a group, the Class
B Interest Holders, as a group, and the General Partner and as among the
Partners comprising a group in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests.

          (e) The Limited Partners shall not have any right or power to

     provided herein.

     8.02. MANAGEMENT BOARD.

          (a) The Partnership shall have a "Management Board" (herein so
     called) which shall have the powers set forth in Section 8.02(k) hereof.
     The Management Board shall be comprised of five members (the "Managers").
     The Class B Interest Holders shall appoint three Managers (the "Class B
     Managers") and the Class A Interest Holders shall appoint two Managers
     (the "Class A Managers"), provided that so long as Heinz Finance is a
     direct or indirect Partner, it shall appoint all of the Class B Managers.
     Any Class B Manager can be replaced at any time by the Class B Interest
     Holders (or so long as Heinz Finance is a direct or indirect Partner, by
     Heinz Finance) and the Class A Managers can be replaced at any time by the
     Class A Interest Holders.

          (b) As of the Effective Date, the Class B Managers shall be Art
     Winkleblack, Leonard Cullo and Laura Stein and the Class A Managers shall
     be Chris Puma and Neil Harrison.

          (c) A majority (in number) of the Managers shall constitute a quorum
     for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Management Board.
     The act or affirmative vote of a majority (in number) of the Management
     Board present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act
     of the Management Board provided that at least one Class B Manager shall
     have consented to such action.

          (d) Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the Management
     Board or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the
     Management Board may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing,
     setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the number of
     Managers required to approve such action at a properly called and
     constituted meeting of the Management Board at which all of the Managers
     were present and voting. Any such consent signed by the number of the
     Managers indicated above in the immediately preceding sentence shall have
     the same effect as an act of a majority (in number) of the Managers at a
     properly called and constituted meeting of the Management Board at which
     all of the Managers were present and voting.

          (e) The Managers may participate in and act at meetings of the
     Management Board through the use of a conference telephone or other
     communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
     the meeting can hear each other. Participation in such meeting shall
     constitute attendance in person at the meeting of the person or persons so
     participating.

          (f) Regular meetings of the Management Board shall be held at such
     times and places as shall be designated from time to time by resolution of

     quarterly and provided such regular meetings of the Management Board shall
     be as often as necessary or desirable to carry out its functions
     hereunder.

          (g) Special meetings of the Management Board may be called by or at
     the request of any Partner for any reasonable purpose. Special meetings of
     the Management Board shall be held at a location mutually agreed to by the
     Managers.

          (h) Notice of any meeting of the Management Board shall be given no
     fewer than five (5) Business Days and no more than twenty (20) Business
     Days prior to the date of the meeting. Notice of any meeting of the
     Management Board shall specify the date, time and place of the proposed
     meeting and the agenda for the meeting (unless such notice is waived in
     writing). Notice shall be delivered in the manner set forth in Section
     14.03 hereof. The attendance of a Manager at a meeting of the Management
     Board shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a
     Manager attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the
     transaction of any business because the meeting is not properly called or
     convened.

          (i) A written record of all meetings of the Management Board and all
     decisions made by it shall be made by such Manager or person appointed by
     the Management Board, and kept in the records of the Partnership and shall
     be initialed or signed by at least one Class B Manager. Minutes and/or
     resolutions of the Management Board when initialed or signed as indicated
     above shall be binding and conclusive evidence of the decisions reflected
     therein and any authorizations granted thereby.

          (j) Except as otherwise determined by the Management Board, no member
     thereof shall be entitled to receive any salary or other remuneration or
     expense reimbursement from the Partnership or any SPV for his/her services
     as a member of the Management Board.

          (k) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
     Management Board shall have the sole power and authority to do the
     following:

               (i) transfer the powers and management authority (but not the
          economic interest) of the General Partner under this Agreement, to
          any other Person, with or without cause and for any reason;

          course of business of the partnership irrespective of the amount),
          including the refinancing of any indebtedness previously issued, the
          material terms of which have not been previously approved by the
          Management Board; provided that the Management Board need not approve
          any such issuance, incurrence or assumption with respect


                                      26

          to any person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
          intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common
          control with any Partner (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
          partnership and its subsidiaries and affiliates);

               (iv) approve the admission of additional Class A Interest
          Holders and/or Class B Interest Holders (in any case where the
          Capital Contribution of such additional Interest Holder exceeds $25
          million) and the major terms and conditions of such Additional
          Admission (including the valuation and acceptance of assets and
          operations of the new Class A Interest Holder and/or Class B Interest
          Holder to be contributed to the Partnership and the assumption of
          liabilities similar in type to the Assumed Liabilities with regard to
          admission of such new Class A Interest Holder and/or Class B Interest
          Holder and their contribution of business assets to the Partnership;

               (v) approve the acceptance of additional Capital Contributions
          exceeding $25 million from any existing Partner for the purpose of
          acquiring one or more additional Properties and the major terms and
          conditions of such transaction (including the acceptance of such
          Capital Contributions, the acquisition of one or more Properties and
          the assumption of liabilities similar in type to the Assumed
          Liabilities with regard to such additional Property or Properties);

               (vi) approve the merger or consolidation of the Partnership with

          of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership;

               (vii) approve the amendment of any material term of the
          organization documents of the Partnership or any SPV (including,
          without limitation, the Agreement);

               (viii) approve the conduct by the Partnership of any business
          outside the ordinary course of its business and such other activities
          as are reasonably related to the ordinary course of its business or
          entering into any transaction, agreement or arrangement changing the
          nature of the Partnership's business;

               (ix) approve any resolution or decision by the Partners
          regarding the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
          Partnership.

     8.03. PARTNERSHIP EXPENSES. All third-party out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by any of the Partners or their respective Affiliates
individually and associated with the formation of the Partnership, the SPVs or

Affiliates individually and associated with or related to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or any SPV Agreement) shall be paid or reimbursed

ownership and operation of the Properties. Bills, receipts and vouchers shall

records of account shall be prepared and maintained by the General Partner at
the principal place of business of the Partnership or such other place or
places as may from time to time be determined by the General Partner. Each
Partner or its duly authorized representative shall have the right to inspect,

     involving the Partnership during the Taxable Year or year of assessment as
     will enable the Partnership and each Partner to timely prepare its
     federal, state and local income tax returns in accordance with applicable
     laws, rules and regulations.

Agreement, no Partner may Transfer all or any portion of its Interest, without
the written consent of the General Partner.

     10.02. PERMITTED TRANSFERS. Any one or more Partners may, from time to
time and in its or their sole and absolute discretion, without the consent of
any other Partner, sell or assign its or their Interests in whole or in part to
any of its or their Affiliates, provided that such sale or assignment does not
cause the Partnership to (i) "terminate" pursuant to Section 708(b) of the
Code, (ii) become a publicly traded partnership for purposes of Section 7704 of
the Code, or (iii) be deemed an "investment company" under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     10.03. TRANSFEREES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

admitted as a Partner) unless (a) such Interest is transferred in compliance
with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, (b) such Transfer shall have
been approved in writing by each of the remaining Partners (which consent may
be withheld in their sole and absolute discretion), unless such Transfer is
made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.02, (c) if applicable,
such transferee shall have furnished evidence of satisfaction of the
requirements of Section 10.02 reasonably satisfactory to the remaining
Partners, and (d) such transferee shall have executed and delivered to the
Partnership such instruments as the remaining Partners reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to effectuate the admission of such transferee as a
Partner and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to be bound by all of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement with respect to such Interest. At
the request of any of the remaining Partners, each such transferee shall also
cause to be delivered to


                                      29
<PAGE>


the Partnership, at the transferee's sole cost and expense, a favorable opinion
of legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such remaining Partners, to the
effect that (i) such transferee has the legal right, power and capacity to own
the Interest proposed to be transferred, (ii) such Transfer does not violate
any provision of any loan commitment or any mortgage, deed of trust or other
security instrument encumbering all or any portion of the Property, (iii) such
Transfer does not violate the provisions of Section 10.02. As promptly as
practicable after the admission of any Person as a Partner, the books and
records of the Partnership shall be changed to reflect such admission. All
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection with
any Transfer of any Interest and, if applicable, the admission of any
transferee as a Partner shall be paid by such transferee.

     10.04. SECTION 754 ELECTION. In the event of a Transfer of all or part of
the Interest of a Partner, at the request of the transferee or if in the best
interests of the Partnership (as determined by the General Partner), the
Partnership shall elect pursuant to Section 754 of the Code to adjust the basis
of any Partnership Property as provided by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code,
and any cost of such election or cost of administering or accounting for such
election shall be at the sole cost and expense of the requesting transferee.

     file and record with respect to the Partnership:

               (i) all amendments to this Agreement regarding a change in name

          (including Sections 10.01 through 10.04 hereof);

               (iii) any amendments to this Agreement regarding (A) the
          admission of additional Class A Interest Holders and/or Class B

          (B) the acceptance of additional Capital Contributions as provided in
          Section 4.04 hereof, and in each case, all other agreements,
          contracts, instruments or other documents relating thereto, but only

          additional Capital Contribution and acquisition of one or more
          additional Properties have been approved by the Management Board and
          only if there has been compliance with the other applicable

               (iv) any and all agreements, contracts, documents and other
          instruments relating to or to effectuate the admission of any
          additional Class A Interest Holder and/or Class B Interest Holder

                                      30
<PAGE>


          Agreement), provided the terms and conditions of such admission have
          been approved by the Management Board and there has otherwise been
          compliance with the other applicable provisions of this Agreement;

               (v) any and all agreements, contracts, documents and other
          instruments relating to or to effectuate any additional Capital
          Contributions from existing Partners (including any amendments to
          this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring one or more additional
          Properties (including any and all agreements, contracts, documents
          and other instruments relating to such acquisition), provided the

     Partners for itself, its administrators, legal representatives, successors
     and assigns that (i) the grant of this power of attorney is irrevocable
     and is coupled with an interest by reason of the facts, among others, that
     the General Partner is relying and will be relying on its power as
     contemplated by these provisions, that the General Partner would not have
     entered into this Agreement were it not for the powers granted to it by
     these provisions and the General Partner has rights in the Partnership
     property which this power is needed to protect and (ii) the grant of this
     power of attorney shall survive the dissolution, insolvency, bankruptcy or
     withdrawal of any Limited Partner and the death, legal incompetency,

     power of attorney may be exercised by the General Partner separately on
     behalf of each Limited Partner by its signature so indicating or on behalf
     of all or any group of the Limited Partners by indicating that the
     signature of the General Partner is given on behalf of all or such group
     of Limited Partners and executing any such instrument with a single
     signature as attorney-in-fact for all or such group of the Limited
     Partners.

XI.  EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

     11.01. EXCULPATION. No Partner shall be liable to the Partnership, any SPV
or to any other Partner for monetary damages for any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities arising from any act or omission performed or omitted by it and
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Partnership's or any
SPV's business or affairs, including any action or omission constituting a
breach of any fiduciary duty; provided, however, such act or omission was
within the scope of authority granted to such Partner and was not attributable
in whole or in part to such Partner's fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct
or gross negligence. THE FOREGOING EXCULPATION PROVISION OF THIS SECTION 11.01
SHALL SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE ANY LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ARISING
FROM ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO
THE ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EXCULPATED PARTY. No general or limited partner
of any Partner, member, shareholder or other holder of an equity interest in
any Partner or officer, director or employee of any of the foregoing shall be
personally liable to the Partnership, any SPV or any Partner in connection with
this Agreement or the Partnership's or any SPV's business and affairs
(including for the performance of any such Partner's obligations under this
Agreement), but the foregoing shall not relieve any partner of any Partner from
its obligations to such Partner.

     11.02. INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) The Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Partner, and each
     general or limited partner of any Partner, member, shareholder or other
     holder of any equity interest in such Partner or any officer, director or
     employee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Indemnitees"),
     against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such
     Indemnitee may become subject in connection with any matter arising out of
     or incidental to any act performed or omitted to be performed by any such
     Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement or the Partnership's or any
     SPV's business or affairs, including any action or omission constituting a
     breach of any fiduciary duty; provided, however, that such act or omission
     was within the scope of authority granted to such Partner or applicable
     Indemnitee and was not attributable in whole or in part to such
     Indemnitee's fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. THE
     FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.02 SHALL
     SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE ANY LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES TO WHICH
     SUCH INDEMNITEE MAY BECOME SUBJECT AS A RESULT OF ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO
     ACT BY SUCH INDEMNITEE WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE
     ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES. If any
     Indemnitee becomes involved in any capacity in any action, proceeding or
     investigation in connection with any matter arising out of or in
     connection with this Agreement or the Partnership's or any SPV's business
     or affairs, the Partnership shall reimburse such Indemnitee for its
     reasonable legal and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
     the cost of any investigation and preparation) as they are incurred in
     connection therewith, provided that such Indemnitee shall promptly repay
     to the


                                      32
<PAGE>


     Partnership the amount of any such reimbursed expenses paid to it if it
     shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to be
     indemnified by the Partnership in connection with such action, proceeding
     or investigation. If for any reason (other than the fraud, bad faith,
     willful misconduct or the ordinary or gross negligence, as the case may
     be, of such Indemnitee) the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to
     such Indemnitee, or insufficient to hold it harmless, then the Partnership
     shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a
     result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such
     proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by
     the Partnership on the one hand and such Indemnitee on the other hand or,
     if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, to reflect not only
     the relative benefits referred to above but also any other relevant
     equitable considerations. Any indemnity under this Section 11.02(a) shall
     be paid solely out of and to the extent of Partnership assets and shall
     not be a personal obligation of any Partner and in no event will any
     Partner be required, or permitted without the consent of all of the
     Partners, to contribute additional capital under Article IV to enable the
     Partnership to satisfy any obligation under this Section 11.02(a).

          (b) Each Partner shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership,
     each SPV and each of the other Partners from and against any and all
     claims, demands, liabilities, costs, damages, expenses and causes of
     action of any nature whatsoever arising out of (i) any act performed by or
     on behalf of such Partner which was not within the scope of authority
     conferred upon such Partner under this Agreement, or (ii) the fraud, bad
     faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Partner. The
     provisions of this Section 11.02(b) shall survive for a period of four
     years from the date of dissolution of the Partnership, provided that if at
     the end of such period there are any actions, proceedings or
     investigations then pending, any Indemnitee may so notify the Partnership
     and the other Partners at such time (which notice shall include a brief
     description of each such action, proceeding or investigation and the
     liabilities asserted therein) and the provisions of this Section 11.02(b)
     shall survive with respect to each such action, proceeding or
     investigation set forth in such notice (or any related action, proceeding
     or investigation based upon the same or similar claim) until such date
     that such action, proceeding or investigation is finally resolved.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, the obligations of the Partnership or any Partner under this
     Section 11.02 shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitee, its
     Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
     Affiliates and any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives
     of such Persons.

          (d) Except as may otherwise be expressly and specifically provided
     herein or in any other agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any
     general or limited partner of any Partner, shareholder, member or other
     holder of any equity interests in any Partner or any officer or director
     of any of the foregoing be liable for any obligations of any Partner.

be fully protected and justified in any action or inaction which is taken or
omitted in good faith, in reliance upon and in accordance with the opinion or
advice of such counsel, accountant or other consultant, appraiser or advisor as
to matters reasonably believed by such Partner or Indemnitee to be within such

XII. DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION

     12.01. DISSOLUTION. The Partnership shall be dissolved and its business
wound up upon the earliest to occur of any of the following events:

          (a) The sale, condemnation or other disposition of all of the
     Properties (or the SPVs) and the receipt of all cash consideration
     therefor;

          (b) The exercise of the election pursuant to Section 13.02(a) hereof;

          (c) The written determination of the General Partner to terminate the
     Partnership;

          (d) The resignation, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of the last
     remaining General Partner or the occurrence of any other event of
     withdrawal with regard to the last remaining General Partner, unless,
     within 90 days after such event, the Management Board elects in writing

consent of the other Partners, no Partner may withdraw from or cause a

<PAGE>


     12.02. TERMINATION. In all cases of dissolution of the Partnership, the
business of the Partnership shall be wound up and the Partnership terminated as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and each of the following shall be
accomplished:

          (a) The Liquidating Partner shall cause to be prepared a statement
     setting forth the assets and liabilities of the Partnership as of the date
     of dissolution, a copy of which statement shall be furnished to all of the
     Partners.

          (b) The Properties shall be liquidated by the Liquidating Partner as
     promptly as possible, but in an orderly and businesslike and commercially
     reasonable manner.

          (c) The proceeds of sale and all other assets of the Partnership
     shall be applied and distributed as follows and in the following order of
     priority:

               (i) To the payment of (A) the debts and liabilities of the
          Partnership, including debts and liabilities to any Partner and (B)
          the expenses of liquidation.

               (ii) To the setting up of any reserves which the Liquidating
          Partner shall determine to be reasonably necessary for contingent,
          unliquidated or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the
          Partnership or any Partner arising out of or in connection with the
          Partnership. Such reserves may, in the discretion of the Liquidating
          Partner, be paid over to a national bank or national title company
          selected by it and authorized to conduct business as an escrow agent
          to be held by such bank or title company as escrow agent for the
          purposes of disbursing such reserves to satisfy the liabilities and
          obligations described above, and at the expiration of such period as
          the Liquidating Partner may reasonably deem advisable, distributing
          any remaining balance as provided in Section 12.02(c)(iii) hereof;
          provided, however, that, to the extent that it shall have been
          necessary, by reason of applicable law or regulation, to create any
          reserves prior to any and all distributions which would otherwise
          have been made under Section 12.02(c)(i) hereof and, by reason
          thereof, a distribution under Section 12.02(c)(i) hereof has not been
          made, then any balance remaining shall first be distributed pursuant
          to Section 12.02(c)(i) hereof.

               (iii) The balance, if any, to the Partners in accordance with
          Section 6.04 hereof.

     12.03. LIQUIDATING PARTNER. The Liquidating Partner is hereby irrevocably
appointed as the true and lawful attorney in the name, place and stead of each
of the Partners, such appointment being coupled with an interest, to make,
execute, sign, acknowledge and file with respect to the Partnership all papers
which shall be necessary or desirable to effect the dissolution and termination
of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Article XII
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Partner, upon the request of the
Liquidating Partner shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
documents, certificates and other instruments as the Liquidating Partner shall
reasonably request to effectuate the proper dissolution and termination of the
Partnership, including the winding up of the business of the Partnership.

breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or any SPV Agreement causing
material damage or loss to the Partnership or any SPV which is not cured within
a Reasonable Period, such Partner having committed such material violation or
breach shall have committed an "Event of Default." For this purpose,
"Reasonable Period" shall mean 20 calendar days after the breaching party is
notified in writing by a non-defaulting Partner.

     13.02. EFFECT OF EVENT OF DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default by any Partner, the non-defaulting Partners shall have the right, at
any time within 180 calendar days from the date of such Event of Default and
upon giving the defaulting Partners five (5) Business Days' written notice of
such election (and provided such Event of Default is continuing through the end
of such five (5) business-day period) to take any of the following actions (in
addition to any other rights, remedies or actions permitted pursuant to any
other provision of this Agreement):

          (a) Dissolve the Partnership and all the SPVs;

          (b) Pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity,
     including punitive, exemplary and consequential damages.

     The default of any Partner hereunder shall not relieve any Partner from

          (b) This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of the Partner enforceable in accordance with its terms.

          (c) No consents or approvals are required from any governmental
     authority or other person or entity for the Partner to enter into this
     Agreement and the Partnership. All limited liability company, corporate or

     authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
     taken.

          (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Partner, and
     the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, does not
     conflict with or contravene the provisions of its organizational documents
     or any agreement or instrument by which it or its properties are bound or
     any law, rule, regulation, order or decree to which it or its properties
     are subject.

          (e) No Partner has retained any broker, finder or other commission or
     fee agent, and no such person has acted on its behalf in connection with
     the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the acquisition of the
     Property.

          (f) Each Partner is acquiring its interest in the Partnership for
     investment, solely for its own account, with the intention of holding such
     interest for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
     connection with, any distribution or public offering or resale of any
     portion of such interest within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933
     (the "Securities Act") or any other applicable federal or state security
     law, rule or regulation ("Security Law").

          (g) Each Partner acknowledges that it is aware that its interests in

     Partner understands and acknowledges that its representations and
     warranties contained herein are being relied upon by the Partnership, the
     other Partners and the constituent owners of such other Partners as the
     basis for exemption of the issuance of interest in the Partnership from
     registration requirements of the Securities Act and other Security Law.
     Each Partner acknowledges that the Partnership will not and has no
     obligation to register any interest in the Partnership under the
     Securities Act or other Security Law.

     representative or attorney is familiar with this Agreement, and with the
     business and affairs of the Partnership, and that except as otherwise
     specifically provided in this Agreement, it does not desire any further
     information or data relating to the Partnership, the property or assets of
     the Partnership or to the other Partners. Each Partner does hereby
     acknowledge that it understands that the acquisition of its interest in
     the Partnership is a speculative investment involving a high degree of
     risk and does hereby represent that it has a net worth sufficient to bear
     the economic risk of its investment in the Partnership and to justify its
     investing in a highly speculative venture of this type.

          (i) Each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
     Partnership and each other Partner and their officers, directors,
     shareholders, partners, employees, successors and assigns from and against
     any and all loss, damage, liability or expense (including reasonable out

     termination and dissolution of any Partner and/or


                                      37

continue to be in force notwithstanding the execution of this Agreement:


4.07 SPECIAL PROVISION. The Partners are transferring their business
operations to the Partnership which include liabilities incurred in connection
with the conduct of the businesses such as trade payables and various other
liabilities in connection with employment of personnel and product disposition.
The Partnership agrees to assume (within the meaning of Section 752 of the
Code) all of the liabilities of each such Partner as of the date hereof other
than the excluded liabilities listed in the Assignment, Assumption and Bill of
Sale Agreements attached hereto as Schedules F1 to F4 (each such Partner's
"Assumed Liabilities"). Each Partner agrees to be secondarily liable for its
Assumed Liabilities and to thereby satisfy its Assumed Liabilities when due if
the Partnership is unable to do so (and for the avoidance of doubt, reference
to the Partnership is reference to the assets of the Partnership and not any
Partner). The Partner satisfying its Assumed Liabilities shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Partnership for any amount so paid by such Partner, but
shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the other Partners (or a Person
related to any such Partner for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-2) in its or such other Partner's capacity as a partner herein or in any
other capacity, and for the avoidance of doubt, if such Partner fails to
satisfy its Assumed Liabilities, such Partner shall pay or reimburse any other
Partner who has, in any capacity or through any means, made a payment or has
suffered an economic loss with respect to such Partner's Assumed Liabilities as
of a result of nonpayment by the Partnership or such Partner of its Assumed
Liabilities. For purposes hereof, the Assumed Liabilities of a Partner shall
