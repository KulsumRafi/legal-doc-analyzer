     days written notice. For CYTYC, such termination shall be its sole and
     exclusive remedy.

N.   Items defined as Product listed on Addenda or added on Addenda (added at a
     later date) will have guaranteed pricing through the term of the Agreement.

O.   If any terms of this Agreement are not met by "LabCorp" and the parties
     cannot agree on a resolution, CYTYC may elect, as its sole and exclusive
     remedy, to terminate this Agreement provided however CYTYC shall be
     entitled to return at no charge to "LabCorp" all inventory in possession of
     "LabCorp" and payment for Product previously shipped and processed
     billables by "LabCorp".

P.   CYTYC warrants that during their applicable shelf life, the disposable
     Product will conform with the Specifications set forth in the package
     insert and the instrumentation and accompanying software will operate in
     accordance with the specifications and warranties set forth on Exhibit
                                                                            ---
     attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, CYTYC
     hereby represents and warrants that the use of any technology or U.S.
     patents licensed hereunder is and will be free of any infringement of U.S.
     patents of other persons. CYTYC hereby represents and warrants that the use
     and sale of any Product covered by this agreement is and will be free of

     or attempt to limit "LabCorp"'s indemnification rights by CYTYC shall be
     effective.

Q.   CYTYC shall give "LabCorp" a 120 day written notification of any Product
     changes.

R.   "LabCorp" may advertise and promote CYTYC's Product and use CYTYC's
     trademarks solely in the manner used by CYTYC and for the purpose of
     marketing the Product. Customer shall not make any representation or
     warranty with respect to the Product other than those made by CYTYC.

S.   CYTYC agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold "LabCorp" and subsidiaries,
     directors, officers, employees, and agents wholly harmless from and against
     third-party claims, losses, damages, lawsuits, settlements, demands,
     causes, judgments, expenses, and cost (including reasonable attorney fees)
     (collectively "Expenses") arising or alleged under or in connection with
     this Agreement or LabCorp's use of Product under this Agreement to the
     extent that such cost and liabilities are caused by a) CYTYC breach of any
     of its warranties in this Agreement, b) the failure of Product to function
     properly for "LabCorp"'s intended use in accordance with the specifications
     in the package insert for the Product, c) any negligence or willful
     misconduct of CYTYC, or d) any other liability resulting from "LabCorp"'s
     use of the Product in accordance with the specifications in the package
     insert for the Product. However, the foregoing rights to indemnity shall
     not apply to the extent that such claim, loss, lawsuit, or settlement
     results from "LabCorp"'s employees, or from the modification of any product
     of CYTYC by a third party not within CYTYC's control or without CYTYC's
     permission. This defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligation shall also
     include, but is not limited to, any such third-party claims, losses,
     damages, lawsuits, settlements, demands, causes, judgments, expenses and
     costs (including reasonable attorney fees) against LabCorp which relate in
     any manner to LabCorp's alleged infringement of any property rights of a
     third party in or to the Product or licenses under this Agreement. In the
     event of a lawsuit or other action in connection with which LabCorp is
     seeking indemnification from CYTYC hereunder, LabCorp agrees to give timely
     notice of the lawsuit or action to CYTYC and to cooperate with CYTYC in the
     defense of the lawsuit or action.
