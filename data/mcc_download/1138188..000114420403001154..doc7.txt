               Common Share and the Current Market Price;

          (iv) in the case of any subdivision,  redivision or change of the then
               outstanding  Ugomedia  Common  Shares  into a  greater  number of
               Ugomedia   Common   Shares   or   the   reduction,   combination,
               consolidation or change of the then  outstanding  Ugomedia Common
               Shares  into a lesser  number of  Ugomedia  Common  Shares or any
               amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other similar transaction

                                       5

               then outstanding Ugomedia Common Shares; and

          (v)  in all cases, the general  taxation  consequences of the relevant
               event to holders of Exchangeable  Shares to the extent that those
               consequences may differ from the taxation consequences to holders
               of  UgoMedia  Common  Shares as a result of  differences  between
               taxation  laws of Canada and the United  States  (except  for any
               differing  consequences arising as a result of differing marginal
               taxation rates and without regard to the individual circumstances
               of holders of Exchangeable Shares).

          appropriate  dividends  are  paid or other  distributions  are made by
          Sciax,  or  subdivisions,  redivisions  or  changes  are  made  to the
          Exchangeable  Shares,  in order to  implement  the  required  economic
          equivalent with respect to the Ugomedia Common Shares and Exchangeable
          Shares as provided for in this Section 2.5.

issuer bid, take-over bid or similar transaction with respect to UgoMedia Common
Shares (an  "OFFER")  is  proposed by UgoMedia or is proposed to UgoMedia or its
shareholders  and is  recommended  by the Board of Directors of UgoMedia,  or is
otherwise  effected or to be effected  with the consent or approval of the Board
of Directors of UgoMedia,  UgoMedia shall, in good faith,  take all such actions
and do all such  things as are  necessary  or  desirable  to enable  and  permit
holders of  Exchangeable  Shares to participate in such Offer to the same extent
and on an equivalent  basis as the holders of UgoMedia  Common  Shares,  without
discrimination.

2.7 DUE  PERFORMANCE.  On and after the Effective  Date,  UgoMedia and Sub shall
duly and timely perform all of their  obligations  under the Purchase  Agreement
