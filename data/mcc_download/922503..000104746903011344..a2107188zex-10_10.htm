Change in Control may be exercised in whole or in part at any time within three years after the date of the Change in Control or until the expiration of the Nonstatutory Option, whichever is earlier; </FONT></P>

that the term of the balance of such award shall continue for a period of time not to exceed the term set forth in the applicable Award Agreement governing such award. If a Change in Control involves
a Restructure or occurs in connection with a series of related transactions involving a Restructure and if such Restructure is in the form of a Non Surviving Event and as a part of such Restructure
shares of stock, other securities, cash or property shall be issuable or deliverable in exchange for Stock, then the Holder of a Award shall be entitle to purchase or receive (in lieu of the Total
Shares that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase or receive), as appropriate for the form of Award, the number of shares of stock, other securities, cash or property to which that number
of Total Shares would have been entitled in connection with such Restructure (and, for Options, at any aggregate exercise price equal to the Exercise Price that would have been payable if that number
of Total Shares had been purchased on the exercise of the Option immediately before the consummation of the Restructure)." </FONT></P>
