INTRODUCTION

Mark Wattles, the chief executive officer, director and majority

In connection with the License Agreement and the operation by Boards
of such video and game stores and the license fee paid under the License
agreement, Hollywood is willing to sell to Boards certain products,
accessories and supplies (collectively, the "Products") and to provide Boards
with certain operational support services ("Support Services") and Boards
desires to have access to the Products and Support from Hollywood.

In the event Boards desires to take advantage of the purchase of
Products and/or Support Services, the parties desire to set forth the terms
and conditions that will apply.

sale, and Hollywood may defer shipment under this Agreement and any other
agreements between Boards and Hollywood until such sums shall have been paid.

3.3	If, in the reasonable judgment of Hollywood, the financial condition
