of an original or fax copy of the form of subscription attached as Exhibit A
hereto (the "SUBSCRIPTION FORM") duly executed by such Holder, to the Company at
its principal office or at the office of its warrant agent (as provided
hereinafter), accompanied by payment, in cash, wire transfer, or by certified or
official bank check payable to the order of the Company, in the amount obtained

then exercisable by the Purchase Price (as hereinafter defined) then in effect.

                1.3. Partial Exercise. This Warrant may be exercised in part
(but not for a fractional share) by surrender of this Warrant in the manner and
at the place provided in subsection 1.2 except that the amount payable by the
holder on such partial exercise shall be the amount obtained by multiplying (a)
the number of shares of Common Stock designated by the holder in the
Subscription Form by (b) the Purchase Price then in effect. On any such partial
exercise, the Company, at its expense, will forthwith issue and deliver to or
upon the order of the holder hereof a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of
the holder hereof or as such holder (upon payment by such holder of any
applicable transfer taxes) may request, the number of shares of Common Stock for
which such Warrant may still be exercised.

                1.4. Fair Market Value. Fair Market Value of a share of Common

Market Value of a share of the Company's Common Stock. Fair Market Value of a
share of Common Stock as of a Determination Date shall mean:

                     (a) If the Company's Common Stock is traded on an exchange
or is quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
Quotation ("NASDAQ") National Market or the NASDAQ SmallCap Market, then the
closing or last sale price, respectively, reported for the last business day
immediately preceding the Determination Date.

                     (b) If the Company's Common Stock is not traded on an
exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market or the NASDAQ SmallCap Market but is
traded on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board, then the mean of the closing bid and
asked prices reported for the last business day immediately preceding the
Determination Date.

                     (c) Except as provided in clause (d) below, if the
Company's Common Stock is not publicly traded, then as the Holder and the
Company agree or in the absence of agreement by arbitration in accordance with
the rules then standing of the American Arbitration Association, before a single
arbitrator to be chosen from a panel of persons qualified by education and
training to pass on the matter to be decided.

                     (d) If the Determination Date is the date of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or any event deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up pursuant to the Company's charter, then all amounts to be payable
per share to holders of the Common Stock pursuant to the charter in the event of
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus all other amounts to be
payable per share in respect of the Common Stock in liquidation under the
charter, assuming for the purposes of this clause (d) that all of the shares of
Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are outstanding at the
Determination Date.

                1.5. Company Acknowledgment. The Company will, at the time of
the exercise of the Warrant, upon the request of the holder hereof acknowledge
in writing its continuing obligation to afford to such holder any rights to
which such holder shall continue to be entitled after such exercise in
accordance with the provisions of this Warrant. If the holder shall fail to make
any such request, such failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the
Company to afford to such holder any such rights.

                1.6. Trustee for Warrant Holders. In the event that a bank or
trust company shall have been appointed as trustee for the holders of the
Warrant pursuant to Subsection 3.2, such bank or trust company shall have all
the powers and duties of a warrant agent (as hereinafter described) and shall
accept, in its own


                                       2


<PAGE>




name for the account of the Company or such successor person as may be entitled
thereto, all amounts otherwise payable to the Company or such successor, as the
case may be, on exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 1.

                1.7 Maximum Exercise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless the Company either obtains shareholder approval, or an exemption
from NASDAQ's corporate governance rules as they may apply to the Company, the
Holder may not receive upon exercise of this Warrant more than the number of
common shares that would result in the Company issuing to the Holder in the
aggregate greater than 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the
Company on date hereof.

            2.1 Delivery of Stock Certificates, etc. on Exercise. The Company
agrees that the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be deemed to be issued to the holder hereof as the record owner of such
shares as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have
been surrendered and payment made for such shares as aforesaid. As soon as
practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or in part, and in any
event within 7 days thereafter, the Company at its expense (including the
payment by it of any applicable issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name
of and delivered to the holder hereof, or as such holder (upon payment by such
holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct in compliance with
applicable Securities Laws, a certificate or certificates for the number of duly
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (or
Other Securities) to which such holder shall be entitled on such exercise, plus,
in lieu of any fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then Fair Market Value
of one full share, together with any other stock or other securities and
property (including cash, where applicable) to which such holder is entitled
upon such exercise pursuant to Section 1 or otherwise.

            2.2.    Cashless Exercise.

                    (a) Payment may be made either in (i) cash or by certified
or official bank check payable to the order of the Company equal to the
applicable aggregate Purchase Price, (ii) by delivery of the Warrant, Common
Stock and/or Common Stock receivable upon exercise of the Warrant in accordance
with Section (b) below, or (iii) by a combination of any of the foregoing
methods, for the number of Common Shares specified in such form (as such
exercise number shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustment in the total number
of shares of Common Stock issuable to the holder per the terms of this Warrant)
and the holder shall thereupon be entitled to receive the number of duly
authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock
(or Other Securities) determined as provided herein.

                    (b) Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary,
if the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock is greater than the
Purchase Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of
exercising this Warrant for cash, the holder may elect to receive shares equal
to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being
cancelled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company
together with the properly endorsed Subscription Form in which event the Company
shall issue to the holder a number of shares of Common Stock computed using the
following formula:

                                    X=Y (A-B)
                                        -----
                                          A

                        Where       X=          the number of shares of Common
                                                Stock to be issued to the holder

                                    Y=          the number of shares of Common
                                                Stock purchasable under the
                                                Warrant or, if only a portion of
                                                the Warrant is being exercised,
                                                the portion of the Warrant being
                                                exercised (at the date of such
                                                calculation)
                                       3


<PAGE>





                                    A=          the Fair Market Value of one
                                                share of the Company's Common
                                                Stock (at the date of such
                                                calculation)

                                    B=          Purchase Price (as adjusted to
                                                the date of such calculation)

            3. Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc.

                3.1. Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case at any
time or from time to time, the Company shall (a) effect a reorganization, (b)
consolidate with or merge into any other person, or (c) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any other person under any plan
or arrangement contemplating the dissolution of the Company, then, in each such
case, as a condition to the consummation of such a transaction, proper and
adequate provision shall be made by the Company whereby the holder of this
Warrant, on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1 at any time after the
consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the effective
date of such dissolution, as the case may be, shall receive, in lieu of the
Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on such exercise prior to such
consummation or such effective date, the stock and other securities and property
(including cash) to which such holder would have been entitled upon such
consummation or in connection with such dissolution, as the case may be, if such
holder had so exercised this Warrant, immediately prior thereto, all subject to
further adjustment thereafter as provided in Section 4.


                3.2. Continuation of Terms. Upon any reorganization,
consolidation, merger or transfer (and any dissolution following any transfer)
referred to in this Section 3, this Warrant shall continue in full force and
effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the shares of stock and other
securities and property receivable on the exercise of this Warrant after the
consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the effective
date of dissolution following any such transfer, as the case may be, and shall
be binding upon the issuer of any such stock or other securities, including, in
the case of any such transfer, the person acquiring all or substantially all of
the properties or assets of the Company, whether or not such person shall have
expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant as provided in Section 4.

            4. Extraordinary Events Regarding Common Stock. In the event that
the Company shall (a) issue additional shares of the Common Stock as a dividend
or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding
shares of Common Stock, or (c) combine its outstanding shares of the Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, then, in each such
event, the Purchase Price shall, simultaneously with the happening of such
event, be adjusted by multiplying the then Purchase Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the
product so obtained shall thereafter be the Purchase Price then in effect. The
Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the
happening of any successive event or events described herein in this Section 4.
The number of shares of Common Stock that the holder of this Warrant shall
thereafter, on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1, be entitled to
receive shall be increased to a number determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Common Stock that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this
Section 4) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator
is the Purchase Price that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this
Section 4) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Purchase Price in effect
on the date of such exercise.

            5. Certificate as to Adjustments. In each case of any adjustment or
readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the
exercise of the Warrant, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its
Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment
or


                                       4

<PAGE>




readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a
statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any
additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed
to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other
Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Purchase Price
and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this
Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as
adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith
mail a copy of each such certificate to the holder of the Warrant and any
Warrant agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

            6. Reservation of Stock, etc. Issuable on Exercise of Warrant;
Financial Statements. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available,
solely for issuance and delivery on the exercise of the Warrant, all shares of
Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of
the Warrant. This Warrant entitles the holder hereof to receive copies of all
financial and other information distributed or required to be distributed to the
holders of the Company's Common Stock.

            7. Assignment; Exchange of Warrant. Subject to compliance with
applicable Securities laws, this Warrant, and the rights evidenced hereby, may
be transferred by any registered holder hereof (a "TRANSFEROR") with respect to
any or all of the Shares. On the surrender for exchange of this Warrant, with
the Transferor's endorsement in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (the
"TRANSFEROR ENDORSEMENT FORM") and together with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company demonstrating compliance with applicable Securities
Laws, the Company at its expense but with payment by the Transferor of any
applicable transfer taxes) will issue and deliver to or on the order of the
Transferor thereof a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of the Transferor
and/or the transferee(s) specified in such Transferor Endorsement Form (each a
"TRANSFEREE"), calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the
number of shares of Common Stock called for on the face or faces of the Warrant
so surrendered by the Transferor.

            8. No Rights as Shareholders. This Warrant does not entitle the
holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company prior to exercise hereof.

            9. Transferability; Compliance with Securities Laws.

                        a. The holder is experienced in evaluating companies
            such as the Company, is able to fend for itself in transactions such
            as the one contemplated by this Warrant, has such knowledge and
            experience in financial and business matters that the holder is
            capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the
            Company, and has the ability to bear the economic risks of the
            investment.

                        b. The holder is acquiring this Warrant and upon
            exercise the shares of Common Stock for investment for such holder's
            own account and not with the view to, or for resale in connection
            with, any distribution thereof. The holder understands that this
            Warrant (and the Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof) have
            not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
            (the "Securities Act"), by reason of a specific exemption from the
            registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon,
            among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent as
            expressed herein. The holder does not have any contract,
            undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell,
            transfer or grant participation to any third person with respect to
            the Warrant (or any Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof). The
            holder understands and acknowledges that the offering of the Warrant
            and the Common Stock will not be registered under the Securities Act
            on the ground that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the
            issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from the registration
            requirements of the Securities Act.


                                       5


<PAGE>





                        c. The holder acknowledges that the Warrant (and the
            Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant) must be held
            indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act
            or an exemption from such registration is available. The Holder is
            aware of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permits
            limited resale of securities purchased in a private placement
            subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In the absence of
            an effective registration statement covering the securities in
            question, the holder may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the
            Warrant (and any Common Stock issued on exercise hereof) only in a
            manner consistent with the terms hereof and the holder's
            representations and warranties herein. In connection therewith, the
            holder acknowledges that the Company will make a notation on its
            stock books regarding the restrictions on transfer set forth in this
            Section 9 and will transfer securities on the books of the Company
            only to the extent not inconsistent therewith.

                        d. The holder has received and reviewed information
            about the Company and has had an opportunity to discuss the
            Company's business, management and financial affairs with its
            management and to review the Company's facilities. The holder
            understands that such discussions, as well as any written
            information issued by the Company, were intended to describe the
            aspects of the Company's business and prospects which the Company
            believes to be material, but were not necessarily a thorough or
            exhaustive description.

                        e. The holder acknowledges that he is an "accredited
            investor" as defined in Rule 501 of the Regulation D as promulgated
            by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
            and shall submit to the Company such further assurances of such
            status as may be reasonably requested by the Company. For state
            securities law purposes, the state of residence of the holder is
            that set forth on the signature page of this Warrant.

                        f. This Warrant may not be transferred or assigned in
            whole or in part without compliance with all applicable federal and
            state securities laws by the transferor and transferee (including
            the delivery of investment representation letters and legal opinions
            reasonably satisfactory to the Company, if requested by the
            Company). Subject to such restrictions, prior to the Expiration
            Time, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable by the
            holder hereof, in whole or in part, at the office or agency of the
            Company referred to in Section 1 hereof. Any such transfer shall be
            made in person or by the holder's duly authorized attorney, upon
            surrender of this Warrant together with the Assignment Form attached
            hereto properly endorsed.

                        g. This Warrant may not be exercised except by an
            "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities
            Act of 1933, as amended, who makes the representations and
            warranties to the Company as set forth on the notice of exercise
            attached hereto. Each certificate representing the Common Stock or
            other securities issued in respect of the Common Stock upon any
            stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation
            or similar event, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
            legend substantially in the following form (in addition to any
            legend required under applicable securities laws):

            THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR IF APPLICABLE, STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THESE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH
SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE LAWS OR COMPLIANCE WITH AN APPLICABLE
EXEMPTION THEREFROM, SUCH COMPLIANCE, AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, TO BE
EVIDENCED BY AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY

TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED

            10. Replacement of Warrant. On receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction of this
Warrant, on delivery of an indemnity agreement or security reasonably
satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such
mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company at its
expense will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

            11. Registration Rights. The Holder of this Warrant has been granted
certain registration rights by the Company. These registration rights are set
forth in a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into by the Company and
Purchaser. The definition of "Warrant" in the Securities Purchase Agreement
shall include this Warrant.

            12. Maximum Exercise. The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise
this Warrant on an exercise date, in connection with that number of shares of
Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise
date, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being
made on an exercise date, which would result in beneficial ownership by the
Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of the Company on such date. For the purposes of the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Holder
shall not be limited to aggregate exercises which would result in the issuance
of more than 4.99%. The restriction described in this paragraph may be revoked
upon 75 days prior notice from the Holder to the Company and is automatically
null and void upon an Event of Default under the Note.

            13. Warrant Agent. The Company may, by written notice to the each
holder of the Warrant, appoint an agent for the purpose of issuing Common Stock
(or Other Securities) on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 1,
exchanging this Warrant pursuant to Section 7, and replacing this Warrant
pursuant to Section 8, or any of the foregoing, and thereafter any such
issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such
office by such agent.

            14. Transfer on the Company's Books. Until this Warrant is
transferred on the books of the Company, the Company may treat the registered
holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any
notice to the contrary.

            15. Notices, etc. All notices and other communications from the
Company to the holder of this Warrant shall be mailed by first class registered
or certified mail, postage prepaid, at such address as may have been furnished
to the Company in writing by such holder or, until any such holder furnishes to
the Company an address, then to, and at the address of, the last holder of this
Warrant who has so furnished an address to the Company.

            16. Voluntary Adjustment by the Company. The Company may at any time
during the term of this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise Price to any
amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors
of the Company.

            17. Miscellaneous. This Warrant and any term hereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the
party against which enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination
is sought. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
Any action brought



                                       7

concerning the transactions contemplated by this Warrant shall be brought only
in the state courts of New York or in the federal courts located in the state of
New York. The individuals executing this Warrant on behalf of the Company agree
to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive trial by jury. The
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its
reasonable attorney's fees and costs. In the event that any provision of this
Warrant is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law,
then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may
conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or
rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under
any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
of this Warrant. The headings in this Warrant are for purposes of reference
only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the terms hereof. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall in no way affect
the validity or enforceability of any other provision. The Company acknowledges
that legal counsel participated in the preparation of this Warrant and,
therefore, stipulates that the rule of construction that ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the interpretation
of this Warrant to favor any party against the other party.
