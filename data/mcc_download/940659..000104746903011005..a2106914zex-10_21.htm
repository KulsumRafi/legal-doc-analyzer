indemnified party under subsection (d)(i)&nbsp;or (d)(ii)&nbsp;above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Investor on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or other matters which resulted
in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, in the case of an untrue statement, whether the untrue statement relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Investor on the other and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement. The Company and the Investor agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d)&nbsp;were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Investors were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not
take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d)&nbsp;shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Investor shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which
the net amount received by the Investor from the sale of the Shares to which such loss relates exceeds the amount of any damages which the Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue statement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Investors' obligations in this subsection to contribute are several in proportion to their sales of Shares to which such loss relates and not joint. </FONT></P>

used in this Questionnaire, the term "net worth" means the excess of total assets over total liabilities. In computing net worth for the purpose of subsection&nbsp;(4), the
principal residence of the investor must be valued at cost, including cost of improvements, or at recently appraised value by an institutional lender making a secured loan, net of encumbrances. In
determining income, the investor should add to the investor's adjusted gross income any amounts attributable to tax exempt income received, losses claimed as a limited partner in any limited
partnership, deductions claimed for depreciation, contributions to an IRA or KEOGH retirement plan, alimony payments, and any amount by which income from long-term capital gains has been reduced in
arriving at adjusted gross income. </FONT></DD></DL>

determines that it must suspend the use of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement (as such terms are defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement to which this Questionnaire is
attached) until such time as an amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed by the Company and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission or until the Company has amended
or supplemented such Prospectus. The undersigned is aware that, in such event, the Shares will not be subject to ready liquidation, and that any Shares purchased by the undersigned would have to be
held during such suspension. The overall commitment of the undersigned to investments which are not readily marketable is not excessive in view of the undersigned's net worth and financial
circumstances, and any purchase of the Shares will not cause such commitment to become excessive. The undersigned is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares. </FONT></P>

each of the risks described under the headings "Cautionary Statements" in the Company's Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have acted as counsel for Endocardial Solutions,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares (the "Shares") of the
Company=s Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, pursuant to those certain Stock Purchase Agreements, dated as
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, including the exhibits thereto (collectively, the
"Agreement"), between the Company and the Investors named therein. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 of the Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein are as defined in
the Agreement unless otherwise specifically provided herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have examined such documents and have reviewed such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
rendering our opinion below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, and the conformity to authentic
originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all parties to all relevant agreements other than the Company. As to
questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, on the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and certificates of officers of the
Company and public officials. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
opinions expressed below as to certain factual matters are qualified as being limited "to our knowledge" or by other words to the same or similar effect. Such words, as used herein,
mean the information known to Kenneth L. Cutler and Robert A. Kuhns, the attorneys in this firm who have represented the Company in connection with the matters addressed herein. In rendering such
opinions, we have not conducted any independent investigation or consulted with other attorneys in our firm with respect to the matters covered by the Agreement. No inference as to our knowledge with
respect to such matters should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the corporate power to conduct any
lawful business activity. The Company has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the Agreement, including without limitation, the issuance and sale of the Shares. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each U.S. jurisdiction in which the character of the business conducted by it or the location of
the properties owned or leased by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Agreement has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, executed and delivered by the Company. The Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement
of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Shares have been duly authorized and, upon issuance, delivery and payment therefor as described in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 40,000,000 shares, $.01 par value, of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares, $.01 par value,
of undesignated Preferred Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the Agreement will not: (a)&nbsp;violate or conflict
with, or result in a breach of or default under, the Articles or by-laws of the Company, (b)&nbsp;violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, the provisions of any material
agreement (limited, with your consent, to agreements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act and applicable rules and regulations) to which the Company is a party, or (c)&nbsp;violate any law of the United States or the Delaware
General Corporation Law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
our knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required to be
obtained or made by the Company for the issue and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Agreement, except such as have been obtained or made and such as may be required under the federal securities laws
or the Blue Sky laws of the various states or the bylaws and rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming
(a)&nbsp;the representations made by the Investors in the Agreement are true and correct, and (b)&nbsp;neither the Company, nor anyone acting on its behalf,
engaged in any form of general solicitation or general advertising in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares, the offer, sale, issuance and delivery of the Shares to the Investors, in the
manner contemplated by the Agreement, does not need to be registered under the Securities Act. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
issuance of the Shares does not require approval of the Company's stockholders pursuant to the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Shares are "Covered Securities" pursuant to the definition of that term in Section&nbsp;18(b) of the Securities Act. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

are admitted to practice law in the State of Minnesota and our opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
opinion in paragraph&nbsp;3 above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general
application affecting creditors= rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
opinion in paragraph&nbsp;3 above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness,
good faith, fair dealing and

express no opinion as to the compliance or the effect of noncompliance by the Investors with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the Investors in
connection with the transactions described in the Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnesota
Statutes 290.371, Subd.&nbsp;4, provides that any corporation required to file&nbsp;a Notice of Business Activities Report does not have a cause of action
upon which it may bring suit under Minnesota law unless the corporation has filed a Notice of Business Activities Report and further provides that the use of the courts of the State of Minnesota for
all contracts executed and all causes of action that arose before the end of any period for which a corporation failed to file&nbsp;a required report is precluded. Insofar as our opinion may relate
to the valid, binding and enforceable character of any agreement under Minnesota law or in a Minnesota court, we have assumed that any party seeking to enforce such agreement has at all times been,
and will continue at all times to be, exempt from the requirement of filing a Notice of Business Activities Report or, if not exempt, has duly filed, and will continue to duly file, all Notice of
Business Activities Reports. </FONT></P>
