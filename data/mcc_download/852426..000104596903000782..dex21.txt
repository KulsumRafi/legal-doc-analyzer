basis of Seller's objection), then the amounts reflected in the Closing Working
Capital Statement will be used in computing the Adjustment Amount. If Seller
gives such notice of objection, then the issues in dispute will be submitted to
Ernst & Young LLP, certified public accountants (the "Accountants"), for
resolution. If issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for
resolution, (i) each party will furnish to the Accountants such workpapers and
other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the
Accountants may request and are available to that party or its Subsidiaries (or
its independent public accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Accountants any material relating to the determination and to
discuss the determination with the Accountants; (ii) the determination by the
Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by the
Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on the parties; and (iii) Buyer and
Seller will each bear 50% of the fees of the Accountants for such determination.

            (b) On the tenth business day following the final determination of
the Adjustment Amount, if the Purchase Price is greater than the payment made
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), Buyer will pay the difference to Seller, and if the
Purchase Price is less than such aggregate amount, Seller will pay the
difference to Buyer. Payment must be made in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to such bank account as the recipient will specify.

            (a) Part 3.1 of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list for each Acquired Company of its name, its jurisdiction of
incorporation, other jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business, and
its capitalization (including the identity of each stockholder and the number of
shares held by each). Each Acquired Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, with full corporate power and authority to conduct its business
as it is now being conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that it
purports to own or use, and to perform all its obligations under Applicable
Contracts. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of those states or other
jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify would have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, properties, prospects, assets, or condition
of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

            (b) Seller has delivered to Buyer or its counsel copies of the
Organizational Documents of each Acquired Company, as currently in effect.

     3.2    AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICT

            (a) This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and binding
obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws and equitable principles relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally from time to time in effect. Seller has the absolute and
unrestricted right, corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) Except as set forth in Part 3.2 of the Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation or
performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions will, directly or indirectly
(with or without notice or lapse of time):

                   (i)     contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, as
they exist as of the Closing Date;

                   (ii)    except for the antitrust laws of any jurisdiction,
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of, or give any Governmental
Body or other Person the right to challenge any of the Contemplated Transactions
or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under, any Legal Requirement or
any Order to which any Acquired Company or Seller, or any of the assets owned or
used by any Acquired Company, may be subject;

                   (iii)   contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Body the right
to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate, or modify, any Governmental
Authorization that is held by any Acquired Company or that otherwise relates to
the business of, or any of the assets owned or used by, any Acquired Company;

                   (iv)    contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
or breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right to declare a default
or exercise any remedy under, or to

                                       10

<PAGE>

accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify,
any Applicable Contract, as they exist as of the Closing Date; or

                   (v)     result in the imposition or creation of any
Encumbrance, other than any Encumbrance that may be created or imposed by the
Buyer, upon or with respect to any of the assets owned or used by any Acquired
Company.

     Except as set forth in Part 3.2 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the
Seller nor any Acquired Company is or will be required to give any notice to or
obtain any Consent from any Person in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

     3.3    CAPITALIZATION

            (a) The authorized equity securities of the Company consist of
50,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which 2,000 shares
are issued and outstanding and constitute the Shares. Seller is the record and
beneficial owner and holder of the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
other than any restrictions imposed by state and federal securities laws. With
the exception of the Shares (which are owned by Seller), all of the outstanding
equity securities and other securities of each Acquired Company are owned of
record and beneficially by one or more of the Acquired Companies.

            (b) No legend or other reference to any purported Encumbrance, other
than any restrictions imposed by state and federal securities laws, appears upon
any certificate representing equity securities of any Acquired Company. All of
the outstanding equity securities of each Acquired Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
Contracts relating to the issuance, sale, or transfer of any equity securities
or other securities of any Acquired Company. None of the outstanding equity
securities or other securities of any Acquired Company was issued in violation
of the Securities Act or any other Legal Requirement. No Acquired Company owns,
or has any Contract to acquire, any equity securities or other securities of any
Person (other than Acquired Companies) or any direct or indirect equity or
ownership interest in any other business (other than Acquired Companies).

            (c) Neither the execution and delivery of the License Agreement, the
Sublicense Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement, nor the performance of
any of the obligations thereunder will, directly or indirectly (with or without
notice or lapse of time):

                   (i)     contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
of any provision of the Organizational Documents of Uponor Innovation AB or
Uponor Oyj, as they exist as of the Closing Date;

                   (ii)    except for the antitrust laws of any jurisdiction,
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any Legal Requirement or
any Order to which Uponor Innovation AB or Uponor Oyj may be subject;

                   (iii)   contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Body the right
to revoke, withdraw,

                                       11

<PAGE>

suspend, cancel, terminate, or modify, any Governmental Authorization that is
held by Uponor Innovation AB or Uponor Oyj; or

                   (iv)    contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation
or breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right to declare a default
or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of,
or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any contract to which Uponor Innovation AB
or Uponor Oyj is a party, as such contracts exist as of the Closing Date.

     3.4    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     Seller has delivered to Buyer or its counsel: (a) (i) the balance sheet of
the Company as at December 31, 1997, and the related statement of income,
changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flow for the fiscal year then ended,
together with the report thereon of KPMG or Arthur Andersen, as applicable,
independent certified public accountants, and (ii) consolidated balance sheets
of the Acquired Companies as at December 31 in each of the years 1998 through
2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flow for each of the fiscal years then ended,

independent certified public accountants, (collectively, the "Balance Sheet"),
(b) unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Acquired Companies as at
December 31, 2002 and the related unaudited consolidated statement of income,

balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as at January 31, 2003 and the related
unaudited consolidated statement of income, for the period then ended. Such
financial statements fairly present the financial condition and the results of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flow of the Acquired
Companies as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such
financial statements, all in accordance with GAAP, subject, in the case of
interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the
effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially
adverse) and the absence of notes (that, if presented, would not differ
materially from those included in the Balance Sheet); the financial statements
referred to in this Section 3.4 reflect the consistent application of such
accounting principles throughout the periods involved. No financial statements
of any Person other than the Acquired Companies are required by GAAP to be
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

     3.5    BOOKS AND RECORDS

     Except as set forth on Part 3.5 of the Disclosure Letter, the books of
account, minute books, stock record books and other records of the Acquired

contained in such minute books. At the Closing, all of those books and records
will be in the possession of the Acquired Companies.

Buyer acknowledges that Seller has made no representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of any of the Title Documents prepared by third parties
and delivered or made available by Seller to Buyer. The Acquired Companies own
(with good and insurable title in the case of real property, subject only to the
matters permitted by the following sentence) all the material properties and
material assets (whether real, personal, or mixed and whether tangible or
intangible) that they purport to own located in the facilities owned or operated
by the Acquired Companies or reflected as owned in the books and records of the
Acquired Companies, including all of the material properties and material assets
reflected in the Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet (except for assets
held under capitalized leases disclosed or not required to be disclosed in Part
3.17 of the Disclosure Letter and personal property sold since December 31, 2002
in the Ordinary Course of Business), and all of the properties and assets
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Acquired Companies since December 31,
2002 (except for personal property acquired and sold since December 31, 2002 in
the Ordinary Course of Business and consistent with past practice), which
subsequently purchased or acquired properties and assets (other than inventory
and short-term investments) are listed in Part 3.6 of the Disclosure Letter. All
material properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet and the Interim
Balance Sheet are free and clear of all Encumbrances and to the Knowledge of
Seller are not, in the case of real property, subject to any rights of way,
building use restrictions, exceptions, variances, reservations, or limitations
of any nature except, with respect to all such properties and assets, (a)
mortgages or security interests shown on the Balance Sheet or the Interim
Balance Sheet as securing specified liabilities or obligations, with respect to
which no default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) exists, (b) mortgages or security interests incurred in
connection with the purchase of property or assets after the date of the Interim
Balance Sheet (such mortgages and security interests being limited to the
property or assets so acquired), with respect to which no default (or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) exists,
(c) liens for current taxes not yet due and payable, and (d) with respect to
real property, (i) minor imperfections of title, if any, none of which is
substantial in amount, materially detracts from the value or impairs the use of
the property subject thereto, or impairs the operations of any Acquired Company,
(ii) any easements, covenants, conditions, restrictions and title defects which
are identified, shown, listed or disclosed in the Title Documents and those
identified, listed or disclosed in Exhibit A of the Letter and Acknowledgment
regarding title defects dated as of even date herewith, and (iii) zoning laws
and other governmental land use restrictions that do not impair the present or
the Acquired Companies' anticipated use of the property subject thereto. Unless

property owned by the Acquired Companies and do not encroach upon the property
of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights of, any other Person.

                                       13

<PAGE>

     3.7    CONDITION AND SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS

            (a) To Seller's Knowledge, the buildings, plants and structures of
the Acquired Companies are structurally sound, and are adequate for the uses to
which they are being put, and, except as set forth on Part 3.7 of the Disclosure
Letter, none of such buildings, plants, or structures is in need of maintenance
or repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs that are not
material in nature or cost.

            (b) To Seller's Knowledge, none of the equipment of the Acquired
Companies is in need of maintenance or repairs except for maintenance and
repairs that are in the Ordinary Course of Business for the Acquired Companies.

     3.8    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

     All accounts receivable of the Acquired Companies that are reflected on the
Balance Sheet or the Interim Balance Sheet or on the accounting records of the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Accounts
Receivable") represent or will represent valid obligations arising from sales
actually made or services actually performed in the Ordinary Course of Business.
Unless paid prior to the Closing Date, the Accounts Receivable are current and
collectible net of the respective reserves shown on the Balance Sheet or the
Interim Balance Sheet or on the accounting records of the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing Date (which reserves are adequate and calculated consistent with
past practice and, in the case of the reserve as of the Closing Date, will not
represent a substantially greater percentage of the Accounts Receivable as of
the Closing Date than the reserve reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet
represented of the Accounts Receivable reflected therein and will not represent
a material adverse change in the composition of such Accounts Receivable in
terms of aging). Subject to such reserves, each of the Accounts Receivable
either has been collected or, to Seller's Knowledge, will be collectible in
full, without any set-off, within 180 days after the day on which it first
becomes due and payable. There is no contest, claim or return, other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business, under any Contract with any obligor of an Account
Receivable relating to the amount or validity of such Account Receivable. Part
3.8 of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all
Accounts Receivable as of the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, which list sets
forth the aging of such Accounts Receivable.

     3.9    INVENTORY

     Part 3.9 of the Disclosure Letter describes the valuation principles
applied by the Seller to its inventory (the "Inventory Valuation Principles").
The inventory of the Acquired Companies, whether or not reflected in the Balance
Sheet or the Interim Balance Sheet, has been valued on the Balance Sheet or the
Interim Balance Sheet or on the accounting records of the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing Date, as the case may be, in accordance with the Inventory
Valuation Principles. The Inventory Valuation Principles are applied in
accordance with GAAP. The quantities of each item of inventory (whether raw
materials, work-in-process, or finished goods) are not excessive, but are
reasonable in the present circumstances of the Acquired Companies.

                                       14

<PAGE>

     3.10   NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

            (a) Except as set forth in Part 3.10 of the Disclosure Letter, the
Acquired Companies have no material liabilities or material obligations of any
nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for
liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against in the Interim Balance
Sheet and current liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since
the date thereof.

            (b) Except as set forth on Part 3.10(b) of the Disclosure Letter,
none of the Acquired Companies has any outstanding liability, indebtedness, or
obligations to any of their Affiliates, whether or not evidenced by any note,
guaranty or other instrument, whether arising under any agreement or otherwise,
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, primary or secondary, due or
to become due, now existing or hereafter arising, all of which shall be
terminated at closing except as set forth on the Disclosure Letter.

     3.11   TAXES

            (a) The Acquired Companies have filed or caused to be filed (on a
timely basis) all Tax Returns that are or were required to be filed by or with
respect to any of them, either separately or as a member of a group of
corporations, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Except for Tax Returns
which are filed on a combined or consolidated basis, Seller has delivered to
Buyer or its counsel copies of, and Part 3.11 of the Disclosure Letter contains
a complete and accurate list of, all United States federal and state income Tax
Returns filed since 1999. Seller has also provided Buyer with pro forma federal
income Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for all years since 1999. The
Acquired Companies have paid, or made provision for the payment of, all Taxes
that have or may have become due pursuant to Tax Returns or otherwise, or
pursuant to any assessment received by Seller or any Acquired Company, except
such Taxes, if any, as are not delinquent or which are listed in Part 3.11 of
the Disclosure Letter and are being contested in good faith and as to which
adequate reserves (determined in accordance with GAAP) have been provided in the
Balance Sheet and the Interim Balance Sheet.

            (b) The United States federal and state income Tax Returns of each
Acquired Company subject to such federal and state income Taxes have been
audited by the IRS or relevant state tax authorities or are closed by the
applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years through 1999, except
with respect to net operating loss carry forwards. Part 3.11 of the Disclosure
Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all audits of all such income
Tax Returns, including a reasonably detailed description of the nature and
outcome of each audit. All deficiencies proposed as a result of such audits have
been paid, reserved against, settled, or, as described in Part 3.11 of the
Disclosure Letter, are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
Part 3.11 of the Disclosure Letter describes all adjustments to the United
States federal income Tax Returns filed by any Acquired Company or any group of
corporations including any Acquired Company for all taxable years since 1999,
and the resulting deficiencies proposed by the IRS. Except as described in Part
3.11 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the Seller nor any Acquired Company has
given or been requested to give waivers or extensions (or is or would be subject
to a waiver or extension given by any other Person) of any statute of
limitations

                                       15

<PAGE>

relating to the payment of United States federal or state income Taxes of any
Acquired Company or for which any Acquired Company may be liable.

            (c) The charges, accruals, and reserves with respect to Taxes on the
Interim Balance Sheet are adequate (determined in accordance with GAAP) and are
at least equal to the Acquired Companies' liabilities for Taxes with respect to
2002 and all prior periods. There exists no proposed Tax assessment against any
Acquired Company except as disclosed in the Balance Sheet or in Part 3.11 of the
Disclosure Letter. No consent to the application of Section 341(f)(2) of the IRC
has been filed with respect to any property or assets held, acquired, or to be
acquired by any Acquired Company. All Taxes that any Acquired Company is or was
required by Legal Requirements to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or
collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the proper Governmental
Body or other Person.

            (d) All Tax Returns filed by (or that include on a consolidated
basis) any Acquired Company are true, correct, and complete. There is no tax
sharing agreement that will require any payment by, or to, any Acquired Company
after the date of this Agreement.

            (e) The composition of the long-term deferred tax liability is
entirely related to the deferred book-tax differences in the depreciation of the
Acquired Companies' assets.

     3.12   NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

     Since December 31, 2002, there has not been any material adverse change in
the business, operations, properties, prospects, assets, or condition of the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, and no event has occurred or circumstance
exists (other than changes in the general economic or industry conditions
affecting the Business) that may result in such a material adverse change.

the rights and obligations of Seller and Buyer as between each other, with
respect to claims by employees or former employees based on occupational injury,

Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their Indemnified Persons harmless with
respect to any Workers' Compensation Claims that arise out of or were caused
during employment by the claimant with any Acquired Company on or prior to the

the Closing Date or Buyer or an Acquired Company after the Closing Date; (ii)
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Indemnified Persons
harmless with respect to any Workers' Compensation Claims that arise out of or

accordance with the clear and convincing evidence that such Workers'
Compensation Claim was caused before and after the Closing Date, respectively,
and

the respective liabilities of Seller and Buyer relating to any Workers'
Compensation Claims to periods before and after the Closing Date in accordance

     Indemnified Persons harmless for Buyer's WC Formula Percentage of such
     Workers' Compensation Claims. As used in this Section 10.4, "WC Formula
     Percentage" means a percentage calculated by dividing the number of years
     (rounded to the nearest whole year) of employment by the claimant with an
     Acquired Company while such Acquired Company was owned, directly or
     indirectly, by the indemnitor under this Section 10.4 by the total number
     of years (rounded to the nearest whole year) of employment by the claimant
     with an Acquired Company prior to and after the Closing Date. Seller and
     Buyer hereby mutually waive as to each other all rights of subrogation
     based on payments to workers hereunder and all rights of immunity or
     limitation of liability based on federal, state or local laws.

     (b) Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Acquired Companies,
and their Indemnified Persons for, and will pay to the Indemnified Persons the
amount of Damages equal to, the value of any defective product manufactured or
sold by the Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, provided that a
claim for indemnity is made to Seller within two years after the Closing Date.

     10.6   INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY BUYER

     Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Indemnified Persons,
and will pay to Seller and its Indemnified Persons the amount of any Damages
arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with:

            (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, provided that a claim for indemnity is made to Buyer within one year
of the Closing Date;

            (b) any Breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in
this Agreement, provided that a claim for indemnity is made to Buyer within
forty-five days after the covenant expires; and

                                       45

<PAGE>

            (c) any claim by any Person for liabilities or obligations of (i)
Buyer relating to, arising out of, or incurred during periods before and after
the Closing Date or (ii) any Acquired Company relating to, arising out of, or
incurred during periods after the Closing Date, except as set forth in Section
10.4 above.

     10.7   LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT--SELLER

     Seller will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with
respect to the matters described in clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section
10.2 or clause (c) of Section 10.3 unless the Damages suffered for any
individual claim or related claims are at least $50,000 and until the total of
all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $300,000, and then only for the
amount by which such Damages exceed $300,000. Seller's obligation to provide
indemnity under Section 10.2(b), (d) and (e) and Section 10.3(c) is subject to
an aggregate cumulative cap equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Purchase
Price. Seller's obligation to provide indemnity under Section 10.2(h) and any
provisions of the License Agreement, Sublicense Agreement and Trademark License
Agreement that would also be breached if indemnification is available to Buyer
under Section 10.2(h), is subject to an aggregate cumulative cap equal to the
aggregate royalties actually paid by the Acquired Companies, or their
Affiliates, and received by one of Seller's Affiliates (excluding royalties
payable to Vinidex under the Vinidex Agreement (as each such term is defined in
the Sublicense Agreement)) under the License Agreement, Sublicense Agreement and
Trademark License Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation on
Seller's liability set forth in this Section 10.7 shall not apply to claims for
indemnity under Section 10.3(c) for a penalty or fine issued pursuant to
Environmental Law.

     10.8   LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT--BUYER

     Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with
respect to the matters described in clauses (a) or (b) of Section 10.6 unless
the Damages suffered for any individual claim or related claims are at least
$50,000 and until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds
$300,000, and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed $300,000.
However, this Section 10.8 will not apply to any Breach of any of Buyer's
representations and warranties of which an officer of Buyer had actual knowledge
at any time prior to the date on which such representation and warranty is made,
and Buyer will be liable for all Damages with respect to such known Breaches.

     10.9   PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

            (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section
10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 or (to the extent provided in the last sentence of
Section 10.3(e)) Section 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding
against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates
that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party's
failure to give such notice.

                                       46

<PAGE>

            (b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.9(a) is brought
against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the
indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or
(ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and
provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense
of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party
and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will
not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees of other counsel or any
other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of
such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in
that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying
party without the indemnified party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights
of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the
commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within
twenty days after the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or
any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but
the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so
defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may
not be unreasonably withheld).

            (d) Seller hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person for
purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement
with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that
process may be served on Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in the
world.

     10.10  INSURANCE COVERAGE

     Prior to seeking indemnification under this Section 10, Buyer, Seller and
any Acquired Company shall exercise reasonable good faith efforts to obtain any
insurance proceeds to which

                                       47

<PAGE>

it may be entitled with respect to any Damages suffered by such Person, and any
claim for indemnification under this Section 10 shall be reduced by the amount
of any insurance proceeds to which such Person may be entitled with respect to
the such Damages.

     10.11  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--OTHER CLAIMS

     A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought.

     10.12  RIGHT OF SET-OFF

     Upon final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the
Buyer's right to any amount under this Section 10, Buyer may set off such amount
against (a) all amounts otherwise payable under the Note and the License
Agreement, and (b) fifty percent of amounts payable under the Sublicense
Agreement. The exercise of such right of set-off by Buyer in good faith will not
constitute an event of default under the Note, the License Agreement or the
Sublicense Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such
right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any
manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

11.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

     11.1   EXPENSES

     Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any right arising out of, this Agreement may be brought against any of the
parties in the courts of the State of Minnesota, County of Hennepin, or, if it
has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the

such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or
proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action
or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party
anywhere in the world.

     11.4   FURTHER ASSURANCES

     The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further

request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

     11.5   WAIVER

     The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither the failure to exercise, nor any delay by any party in
exercising, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or
privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or
privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged
by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or

                                       49

<PAGE>

renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party;
(b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one
party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the
right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement.

     11.6   ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION

     This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the parties with
respect to its subject matter (including the Letter of Intent between Buyer and
Seller dated November 14, 2002) and constitutes (along with the documents
referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms
of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party
to be charged with the amendment.

     Neither party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
except that Buyer may assign any of its rights, but not its obligations, under
this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement, including but not limited to Article
10, will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of
its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

     11.9   SEVERABILITY

     If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the
extent not held invalid or unenforceable.
