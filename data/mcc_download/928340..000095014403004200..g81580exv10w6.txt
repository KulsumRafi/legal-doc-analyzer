     b.   During the period or periods that the Company does not enjoy an
          exemption from royalties on sales to the Customer, payable to the
          Cayman Islands Government under the terms of the Licence, the Customer

                           ------------- +  ---------------
                              USPPI02           CICPI02

              On each January 1st commencing 1st January 2004 the Royalty-Due
              Consumption Charge will be adjusted to the figure obtained by
              reference to the following formula:-

                           $5.093xUSPPIL    $4.16xCICPIL
                           ------------- +  ---------------
                              USPPI02           CICPI02

          For the purposes of this sub-clause:-


          USPPIL is the United States Producer Price Index for Industrial
          Commodities at the preceding September 30th and USPPI02 is that index
          at September 30, 2002, and

          CICPIL is the Cayman Islands Consumer Price Index at the preceding
          September 30th and CICPI02 is that index at September 30, 2002.

          BUT if the Cayman Islands Government does not produce a Consumer Price
          Index at any relevant date, the United States Government Consumer
          Price Index for that date must be used.

     d.   The Electricity Charge is the cost of electricity (including the fuel
          adjustment factor) purchased from Caribbean Utilities Co. Ltd. in US$
          per Kwh multiplied by 14.5. As this charge fluctuates, the Electricity
          Charge per 1,000 U.S. gallons in each calendar month will be adjusted
          to the actual cost of electricity per kwh (including the fuel
          adjustment factor) in each calendar month multiplied by 14.5.

     e.   CWC must have the water tariff meter(s) on which the Customer's water
          consumption is calculated and which is installed at the junction of
          the Supply Line and CWC's plant recalibrated every six months by
          returning it to the manufacturer or by another method acceptable to
          the Customer and the meter must have a margin of error not greater
          than +/-1.5% within the range of 150,000 to 200,000 U.S. gallons per
          day.

                                     2 of 5

     f.   The parties will read the tariff meter(s) at 10:00 a.m., or such other
          time as they agree, on the last day of each calendar month. Both
          parties are entitled to be present by an authorised representative.

     g.   CWC must invoice the Customer each calendar month for the Monthly
          Charge for the previous month and any unpaid balance on the account
          (including interest on any late payments at the rate set out below)
          and the Customer must pay each invoice within ten (10) days failing
          which, without prejudice to any other rights under this Agreement, CWC
          may cease supplying water until the Company pays the invoice in full
          together with interest at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated on a
          daily basis from the due date to the date of payment, which CWC may
          charge whether or not it continues to supply water.

4.   SECURITY DEPOSIT

     The Customer must pay CWC on the date of this Agreement, a deposit of
     US$40,000.00 (receipt of which CWC acknowledges) which CWC must hold on
     account of the payment of the Monthly Charge during the last three months
     of the Term. Accordingly, during the notice period required by clause 6(2),
     no further payments of invoices need be made by the Customer unless and
     until the total of those invoices exceeds US$40,000.00 at which time all
     the provisions of this Agreement relating to payment will apply once more.
     If at the end of the Term, any portion of the deposit remains unused, CWC
     must immediately refund it to the Customer without interest.

5.   FORCE MAJEURE

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the rights of
     either party against the other and any corresponding obligations of the
     other will be suspended during any period in which this Agreement cannot be
     carried out because of force majeure which includes, without limitation,
     hurricane, fire, flood or other acts of God, accident, explosion, war,
     strike, lockout, labour trouble, expropriation by Governmental authority,
     regulation, orders or requests of Governmental agencies or inability by the
     exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain supplies, materials or power.

6.   TERMINATION

     (1)  This Agreement may, without prejudice to any other rights which the
          terminating party may have against the other, be immediately
          terminated by either party if the other party:-

               agreements set out in this Agreement and does not remedy the
               breach (if capable of remedy) within 30 days of service on it of
               notice so to do; or

          (b)  is prohibited from performing its obligations under this
               Agreement as a result of any applicable law or regulation.

     (2)  Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause on giving one
          hundred and twenty (120) days notice to the other expiring at the end
          of a calendar month but no such termination may be effective prior to
          31st December 2004.
