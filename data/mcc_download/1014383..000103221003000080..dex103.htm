commencement of such action. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, to assume the defense of such action jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, with
counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnified and indemnifying parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to
retain one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure by an indemnified party to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action, however, will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party under this Article 4 unless, and to the extent, such failure is prejudicial to the indemnifying party&#146;s
ability to defend such action. No indemnifying party, in defending any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, unless the claimant or
plaintiff agrees to release the indemnified party from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"

respect to any Loss, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party pursuant to this Article 4, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the Violation that resulted in such Loss, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided however, that in no
event shall any contribution by a Holder under this Section 4.3(b) exceed the aggregate proceeds from the offering received by such Holder, except in the case of willful fraud by such Holder. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the
indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the Violation relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such Violation. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND
