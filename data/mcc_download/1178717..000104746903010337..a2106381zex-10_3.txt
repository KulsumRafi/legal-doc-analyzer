          (e)  SECTION 5.12. Section 5.12 B is hereby deleted in its entirety
and replaced with the following:

                      "If it shall be reasonably determined by the Take-Out
          Banks in consultation with the Company and Holdings based upon the
          prevailing market conditions that it is necessary and advisable to
          sell the Demand Take-Out Notes with an equity component, Holdings
          shall issue common equity to the purchasers of the Demand Take-Out
          Notes in such amount as is necessary in order for the Company to repay
          the Term Loan in whole or in part, after taking into account the
          prevailing market conditions; provided that in no event will Holdings
          be required to issue common equity in excess of the Warrant Basket.
          For purposes of this Agreement, Warrant Basket means 5% of Holdings'
          fully diluted common equity at the earlier of (x) the time of sale of
          the first Demand Take-Out Notes with an equity component pursuant to
          this Section 5.12B or (y) June 30, 2001 (such date being referred to
          as the "Initial Warrant Issuance Date") less the amount of any common
          equity issued in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.13(iv)
          and less any common equity previously issued pursuant to this Section
          5.12B, it being understood that prior to June 30, 2001 the Take-Out
          Banks can allocate, in their sole discretion, more or less than the
          pro rata amount of warrants in connection with the issuance of Demand
          Take-Out Notes. After June 30, 2001, the number of warrants issued in
          connection with the sale of Demand Take-Out Notes shall be determined
          on a pro rata basis based upon the aggregate principal amount of Term
          Loans outstanding on June 30, 2001 unless, with respect to any
          particular Lender, such Lender agrees and so directs the Take-Out
          Banks with respect to any portion of the common equity that such
          Lender would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 5.13(iv) in
          connection with an Exchange Request to relinquish the future right to
          receive all or a portion of such common equity and instead have it
          issued in connection with the sale of Demand Take-Out Notes, it being
          further understood that if the Take-Out Banks sell Demand Take-Out
          Notes without using the full amount of the Warrant Basket, then the
          full amount of the Warrant Basket shall be available, as needed, in
          connection with subsequent issuances of Demand Take-Out Notes in
          accordance with this Section 5.12B and for issuance pursuant to
          Section 5.13(iv). Such common equity will take the form of warrants
          substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit XIII or as
          otherwise agreed to by Holdings and the Agents (the "Warrant
          Agreement") and shall have the benefit of the Registration Rights and
          Stockholders Agreement."

          (f)  SECTION 5.13. Section 5.13 is hereby deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

<Page>

                      "On any date after June 30, 2001, on the 15th Business Day
          following the written request (the "Exchange Request") of a holder of
          Term Notes requesting the exchange of Term Notes for Exchange Notes:

                      (i)   The Company shall execute and deliver, cause each
          Subsidiary Guarantor to execute and deliver, and cause a bank or trust
          company acting as trustee thereunder to execute and deliver, the
          Senior Subordinated Indenture, if such Senior Subordinated Indenture
          has not previously been executed and delivered;

                      (ii)  The Company shall execute and deliver to such
          holders or beneficial owners in accordance with the Senior
          Subordinated Indenture notes in the form attached to the Senior
          Subordinated Indenture (the "Exchange Notes") bearing a fixed interest
          rate equal 13.5% per annum in exchange for such Term Notes dated the
          date of the issuance of such Exchange Notes, payable to the order of
          such holder or owner, as the case may be, in the same principal amount
          as such Term Notes being exchanged, and cause each Subsidiary
          Guarantor to endorse its guarantee thereon;

                      (iii) The Company shall execute and deliver, and cause
          each Subsidiary Guarantor to execute and deliver, to such holder or
          owner, as the case may be, a Registration Rights Agreement in the form
          of Exhibit V; if such Registration Rights Agreement has not previously
          been executed and delivered or, if such Registration Rights Agreement
          has previously been executed and delivered and such holder or owner is
          not already a party thereto, permit such holder or owner to become a
          party thereto; and

                      (iv)  Holdings shall issue to each holder requesting
          Exchange Notes common equity in an amount equal to such holder's pro
          rata share (based upon its respective ownership of the aggregate
          principal amount of Term Loans outstanding at June 30, 2001) of the
          Warrant Basket as of June 30, 2001, and such common equity will take
          the form of warrants substantially in the form of the Warrant
          Agreement and shall have the benefits of the Registration Rights and
          Stockholders Agreement. Any transfer of Term Loans by any Lender may,
          at the option of the transferor Lender, include the right of any such
          transferee Lender to receive all or a portion of such transferor
          Lender's share of common equity upon a receipt of Exchange Notes
          pursuant to an Exchange Request by such transferee Lender. The right
          to receive common equity not so transferred pursuant to the
          immediately preceding sentence shall remain available to such
          transferor Lender for any future transfer of Term Loans by such
          transferor Lender and/or upon a request for Exchange Notes by such
          transferor Lender or, at the request of such transferor Lender, such
          common equity shall be available to the Take-Out Banks pursuant to
          Section 5.12B.

                      The principal amount of the Term Notes to be exchanged
          pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall be at least $5,000,000 and
          integral multiples of $10,000

<Page>

          in excess thereof. Term Notes delivered to the Company under this
          Section 5.13 in exchange for Exchange Notes shall be canceled by the
          Company and the corresponding amount of the Term Loan deemed repaid
          and the Exchange Notes shall be governed by and construed in
          accordance with the terms of the Senior Subordinated Indenture.

                      The bank or trust company acting as trustee under the
          Senior Subordinated Indenture shall at all times be a corporation
          organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of
          America or the State of New York, in good standing and having its
          principal offices in the Borough of Manhattan, in The City of New
          York, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust
          powers and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
          State authority."

               Subsequent to June 30, 2001 and provided that the fees payable
pursuant to Section 2.4 have been paid in full, the Company will no longer be
subject to the covenants set forth in Sections 6.1 through 6.14 but instead will
be subject to the covenants set forth in Exhibit XIV attached hereto, with
appropriate modifications thereto to reflect Loans instead of Exchange Notes. As
soon as reasonably practicable after June 30, 2001, the Company, Holdings, the
Agents and the Lenders shall enter into an amended and restated senior
subordinated credit agreement incorporating such revised covenants."

          (h)  SECTION 12.6. Section 12.6 of the Credit Agreement is hereby
amended by deleting the "or" prior to the "(viii)" in the first proviso to the
first sentence of Section 12.6 and adding the following at the end of such first
proviso:

          "(ix) modify the third sentence of Section 5.1213 regarding the
issuance of warrants after June 30, 2001 in connection with an issuance of
Demand Take-Out Notes in a manner adverse to any Lender; or (x) modify Section
