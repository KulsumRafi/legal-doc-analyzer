    On January 7, 2003, IAMGold and Repadre completed a previously-announced
    business combination transaction by way of arrangement under the provisions
    of the BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (Ontario) (the "Arrangement"). Pursuant to
    the Arrangement, Repadre amalgamated with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    IAMGold and each holder of common shares of Repadre was issued, in exchange
    therefor, 1.6 common shares of IAMGold for each common share of Repadre
    held. The Arrangement was approved by the shareholders of Repadre at a
    special meeting of shareholders of Repadre held on January 6, 2003 and was
    approved by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and became effective on
    January 7, 2003.

    As a result of the Arrangement, IAMGold effectively acquired ownership of
    39,361,786 common shares of Repadre, being all of the outstanding common
    shares of Repadre. A total of 62,978,756 common shares of IAMGold were
    issued at the effective time of the Arrangement. In addition, a total of
    2,711,999 common shares of IAMGold were reserved for issue upon the exercise
    of options held by former directors, officers and employees of Repadre. As a
    result of the Arrangement, such options became exercisable for common shares
    of IAMGold at the exchange ratio used in respect of the Arrangement.

    In conjunction with the completion of the Arrangement, the number of
    directors of IAMGold was increased to nine, with six of the current
    directors of IAMGold remaining as directors of IAMGold and with Joe Conway,
    Don Charter and Robert Quartermain, former directors of Repadre, being
    appointed as directors of IAMGold. Rodney Stamler and Lord Robert Armstrong
    both stepped down as directors of IAMGold. William Pugliese and Mark
    Nathanson will continue as Co-Chairmen of IAMGold.

    Upon the completion of the Arrangement, the officers of IAMGold are as
    follows:
