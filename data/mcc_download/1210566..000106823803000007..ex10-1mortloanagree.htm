associated with the execution and recording of multiple assignment documents,
the Seller may execute one or more assignments of mortgages naming the Indenture
Trustee as assignee. Notwithstanding the fact that such assignments of mortgages
name the Indenture Trustee as assignee, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Mortgage Loans shall for all purposes be deemed to have been
transferred from the Seller to the Purchaser, from the Purchaser to the Issuer,
and from the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee. </FONT></P>
