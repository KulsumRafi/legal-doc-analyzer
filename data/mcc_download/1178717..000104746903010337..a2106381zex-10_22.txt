II.  AMENDMENTS TO U.S. SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTY.

          1.   Section 10 of the U.S. Subsidiaries Guaranty is hereby amended by

following clause (c) of said Section:

          "(d) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and affirms that it
     understands that to the extent the Obligations are secured by real property
     located in the State of California, such Guarantor shall be liable for the
     full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding foreclosure on such
     real property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing such
     Guarantor's or any secured creditors' right to proceed against any
     Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Obligations.

          (e) Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable law, all rights and benefits under Sections 580a, 580b, 580d and
     726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Each Guarantor hereby
     further waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof, all
     rights and benefits which might otherwise be available to such Guarantor
     under Sections 2809, 2810, 2815, 2819, 2821, 2839, 2845, 2848, 2849, 2850,

     and any other rights and defenses available to such Guarantor by reason of
     Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code, including,
     without limitation, (1) any defenses such Guarantor may have to this
     Guaranty by reason of an election of remedies

                                       -4-
<Page>

     by the Creditors and (2) any rights or defenses such Guarantor may have by
     reason of protection afforded to any Borrower pursuant to the
     antideficiency or other laws of California limiting or discharging such
     Borrower's indebtedness, including, without limitation, Section 580a, 580b,
     580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. In furtherance of
     such provisions, each Guarantor hereby waives all rights and defenses
     arising out of an election of remedies by the Creditors, even though that
     election or remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure destroys such
     Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Borrower by
     the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or
     otherwise.

          (g) Each Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set
     forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and
     consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary
     to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective

Agreement or any other Credit Document.

          3.   This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with Holdings and the Administrative Agent.

          4.   THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.
