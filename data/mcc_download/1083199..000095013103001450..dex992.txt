                        to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

                              (B)   except as otherwise expressly provided in

                        incurred or made by the Indenture Trustee or Separate
                        Trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with any

                        compensation, expenses and disbursements of its agents
                        and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or

                        misconduct on their part, arising out of or in
                        connection with the acceptance or administration of the
                        transactions contemplated by the Basic Documents,
                        including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending
                        themselves against any claim or liability in connection
                        with the exercise or performance of any of their powers
                        or duties under the Indenture; and

                              (D)   indemnify the Owner Trustee (including in
                        its individual capacity) and its officers, directors,
                        employees, successors, assigns, agents and servants as
                        primary obligor from and against, any and all
                        liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, taxes,
                        claims, actions and suits, and any and all reasonable
                        and documented costs, expenses and disbursements
                        (including reasonable and documented legal fees and
                        expenses and other amounts owed to the Owner Trustee
                        pursuant to the Trust Agreement) of any kind and nature
                        whatsoever (collectively, "Expenses") which may at any
                        time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
                        Owner Trustee in any way relating to or arising out of
                        the Basic Documents, the Owner Trust Estate, the
                        administration of the Owner Trust Estate or the action
                        or inaction of the Owner Trustee, except only that the
                        Administrator shall not be liable for or required to
                        indemnify the Owner Trustee from and against Expenses
                        arising or resulting from any of the matters described
                        in the third sentence of Section 7.01 of the Owner Trust
                        Agreement. The indemnities contained in this Section
                        shall survive the resignation or termination of the
                        Owner Trustee, or the termination of this Agreement. In
                        any event of any claim, action or proceeding for which
                        indemnity will be sought pursuant to this Section, the
                        Owner Trustee's choice of legal counsel shall be subject
                        to the approval of the Administrator, which approval
                        shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (b)   Additional Duties of the Administrator.

                        (i)   In addition to the duties set forth in Section 1
                  (a)(i), the Administrator shall perform such calculations and
                  shall prepare or shall cause the preparation by other
                  appropriate persons of, and shall execute on behalf of the
                  Issuer or the Owner Trustee, all such documents, reports,
                  filings, instruments, certificates and opinions that it shall
                  be the duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to prepare,
                  file or deliver pursuant to the Related Agreements, and at the
                  request of the Owner Trustee shall take all appropriate action
                  that the Issuer or the

                                       7

<PAGE>

                  Owner Trustee is required to take pursuant to the Related
                  Agreements. In furtherance thereof, the Owner Trustee shall on
                  behalf of itself and of the Issuer, execute and deliver to the
                  Administrator and to each successor Administrator appointed
                  pursuant to the terms hereof, one or more powers of attorney
                  substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, appointing the
                  Administrator the attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee and
                  the Issuer for the purpose of executing on behalf of the Owner
                  Trustee and the Issuer all such documents, reports, filings,
                  instruments, certificates and opinions. Subject to Section 5
                  of this Agreement, and in accordance with the directions of
                  the Owner Trustee, the Administrator shall administer, perform
                  or supervise the performance of such other activities in
                  connection with the Collateral (including the Related
                  Agreements) as are not covered by any of the foregoing
                  provisions and as are expressly requested by the Owner Trustee
                  and are reasonably within the capability of the Administrator.

                        (ii)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
                  Related Agreements to the contrary, the Administrator shall be
                  responsible for performance of the duties of the Owner Trustee
                  set forth in Sections 5.05 and 5.06 of the Owner Trust
                  Agreement with respect to, among other things, accounting and
                  reports to the Depositor.

                        (iii)  As soon as practicable, but no later than
                  seventeen months after the date of the final prospectus, the
                  Administrator will cause the Indenture Trustee to make
                  generally available to the Noteholders an earnings statement
                  of the Issuer covering a period of at least 12 months
                  beginning after the later of (i) the effective date of the
                  registration statement relating to the Notes and (ii) the
                  effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to
                  the registration statement to become effective prior to the
                  date of the final prospectus and, in each case, satisfying the
                  provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act (including
                  Rule 158 promulgated thereunder).

                        (iv)   The Administrator shall provide written notice to
                  the Indenture Trustee upon notification to the Administrator
                  that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to
                  properly discharge its responsibilities as described in the
                  Depository Agreement. Upon the receipt of such notification
                  from the Clearing Agency, the Administrator shall use
                  reasonable efforts to locate and appoint a qualified successor
                  Clearing Agency.

                        (v)    The Administrator shall have the duties of the
                  Administrator specified in Section 10.02 of the Owner Trust
                  Agreement required to be performed in connection with the
                  resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee, and any other
                  duties expressly required to be performed by the Administrator
                  under the Owner Trust Agreement.

                        (vi)   In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of
                  its other obligations under this Agreement, the Administrator
                  may enter into transactions or otherwise deal with any of its
                  Affiliates; provided that the terms of any such transactions
                  or dealings shall be in accordance with any directions
                  received from the Issuer and

                                       8

<PAGE>

                  shall be, in the Administrator's opinion, no less favorable to
                  the Issuer than would be available from unaffiliated parties.

                  (c)   Non-Ministerial Matters.

                        (i)    With respect to matters that in the reasonable
                  judgment of the Administrator are non-ministerial, the
                  Administrator shall not take any action unless authorized
                  pursuant to the Basic Documents and within a reasonable time
                  before the taking of such action, the Administrator shall have
                  notified the Owner Trustee of the proposed action and the
                  Owner Trustee shall not have unreasonably withheld consent or
                  shall not have provided an alternative direction. For the
                  purpose of the preceding sentence, "non-ministerial matters"
                  shall include, without limitation:

                               (A)   the amendment of or any supplement to the
                        Indenture;

                               (B)   the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by
                        the Issuer and the compromise of any action, claim or
                        lawsuit brought by or against the Issuer (other than in
                        connection with the collection of the Contracts);

                               (C)   the amendment, change or modification of
                        the Related Agreements;

                               (D)   the appointment of successor Note
                        Registrars, successor Paying Agents and successor
                        Indenture Trustees pursuant to the Indenture or the
                        appointment of a successor Administrator or a Successor
                        Servicer, or the consent to the assignment by the Note
                        Registrar, Paying Agent or Indenture Trustee of its
                        obligations under the Indenture; and

                               (E)   the removal of the Indenture Trustee.

                        (ii)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
                  Agreement, the Administrator shall not be obligated to, and
                  shall not, (A) make any payments to the Noteholders under the
                  Related Agreements, (B) sell the Collateral pursuant to clause
                  (iv) of Section 5.04(a) of the Indenture, (C) take any other
                  action that the Issuer directs the Administrator not to take
                  on its behalf or (D) take any other action which may be
                  construed as having the effect of varying the investment of
                  the Holders.

        Section 2.      Records.

                  The Administrator shall maintain appropriate books of account
and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of account and
records shall be accessible for inspection by the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee with reasonable prior notice at any time during normal business hours.
The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall, and shall cause their
representatives to, hold in confidence all such information except to the extent
disclosure may be required by law (and all reasonable applications for
confidential treatment are unavailing) and

                                       9

<PAGE>

except to the extent that the Indenture Trustee may reasonably determine that
such disclosure is consistent with its obligations under the Indenture.

         Section 3.   Compensation.

                  As compensation for the performance of the Administrator's
obligations under this Agreement and as reimbursement for its expenses related

         Section 4.   Additional Information to be Furnished to the Issuer.

                  The Administrator shall furnish to the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee from time to time such additional information regarding the
Collateral as the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall reasonably request.

         Section 5.   Independence of the Administrator.

                  For all purposes of this Agreement, the Administrator shall be
an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the
Issuer or the Owner Trustee with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes
the performance of its obligations hereunder. Unless expressly authorized by the
Issuer, the Administrator shall have no authority to act for or represent the
Issuer or the Owner Trustee in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an
agent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee.

         Section 6.   No Joint Venture.

                  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute the
Administrator and any of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee
as members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate,
unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) be construed to impose
any liability as such on any of them or (iii) be deemed to confer on any of them
any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any obligation or liability
on behalf of the others.

         Section 7.   Other Activities of Administrator.

                  Nothing herein shall prevent the Administrator or its
Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its sole discretion, from
acting in a similar capacity as an administrator for any other Person or entity
even though such person or entity may engage in business activities similar to
those of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

         Section 8.   Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of
Administrator.

                  This Agreement shall continue in force until the dissolution

changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or
of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders; provided that such
amendment will not, as so evidenced, upon the request of the Indenture Trustee,
by an Officer's Certificate, materially and adversely affect the interest of any
Noteholder. This Agreement may also be amended by the parties hereto with the
prior written consent of the Owner Trustee and the holders of Notes evidencing
at least 50% of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of

Trustee and the Indenture Trustee and subject to the satisfaction of the Rating
Agency Condition in respect thereof. An assignment with such consent and
satisfaction, if accepted by the assignee, shall bind the assignee hereunder in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be assigned by the Administrator without the
consent of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee to a
corporation or other organization that is a successor (by merger, consolidation
or purchase of assets) to the Administrator; provided that the Rating Agency
Condition is satisfied and such successor organization executes and delivers to
the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an agreement, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, in which such corporation or other organization agrees to be
bound hereunder by the terms of said assignment in the same manner as the
Administrator is bound hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
bind any successors or assigns of the parties hereto.

                  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
