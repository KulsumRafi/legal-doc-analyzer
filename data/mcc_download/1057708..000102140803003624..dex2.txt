                           GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES INC.
                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     FOR THE QUARTER ENDED December 31, 2002

General

        We design, manufacture and sell a wide range of small household
appliances to brand marketers in developed countries. Our products, all of which
are manufactured in China, are marketed by our customers under brand names such
as Black & Decker(R), DeLonghi(R), Dirt Devil(R), Eureka(R), Hamilton Beach(R),
Krups(R), Morphy Richards(R), Mr. Coffee(R), Proctor-Silex(R), Sunbeam(R) and
West Bend(R). We manufacture over 100 different models, primarily in four
product categories:

       .  kitchen appliances, such as coffeemakers and indoor grills;

       .  garment care products, such as steam irons;

       .  travel products and accessories, such as travel irons; and

       .  floor care products, such as upright vacuum cleaners and hand-held
          steam vacuum cleaners.

       We were founded in 1963 and, for most of our history, operated as a
contract manufacturer of products developed by our customers. In recent years,
however, we have emphasized original design manufacturing. As an original design
manufacturer, or ODM, we design and develop proprietary new products which we
manufacture for our customers. This shift in emphasis was made possible by our
forming a product design and development team consisting of engineers who focus
on the development of new products. Net sales of our ODM products represented
48.3% and 54.3% of our net sales during the three months ended December 31, 2001
and December 31, 2002, respectively, and 50.7% and 46.3% of our net sales during
the nine months ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, with the
remaining sales generated by our contract manufacturing activities. Sales of ODM
products have increased as a percentage of net sales in the 2003 quarterly
period mainly due to a decline in sales to one of our major contract
manufacturing customers, Royal Appliance Mfg. Co. Sales of ODM products had been
declining as a percentage of net sales over the last several years. This trend
is expected to continue in the near term due to an anticipated increase in sales
of new floor care products, which are primarily contract manufactured products.
We expect to continue to emphasize our ODM strategy to the greatest extent
possible, however, as ODM products generally have higher profit margins.

        We also are continuing to acquire new technologies in an effort to
expand our capabilities in manufacturing finished products. These transactions
are part of our long-term business strategy to gradually diversify and transform
a portion of our manufacturing facility to higher-value, technology-oriented
products that we believe will allow us to leverage our existing research and
development and technical management staff in Hong Kong, as well as our
manufacturing infrastructure in China. Our long-term strategic focus is to
de-emphasize component manufacturing, as component manufacturing does not offer
value-added opportunities on a consistent basis.

       Since most of our purchases and sales are denominated in U.S. dollars,
our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, our functional currency.
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. References to an interim period refers to the nine month
period ended; for example, "2003 interim period" refers to the nine month period
ended December 31, 2002.

References to a quarterly period refer to our fiscal quarter ended on December

December 31, 2002.

Note: On November 1, 2002, we announced that our subsidiary, Global Lite Array
(BVI) Limited, entered into an agreement to sell Lite Array's TFEL display
business, including the interest that Lite Array owns in a joint venture
manufacturing facility in Jiangmen, China, to the former management of Lite
Array. As a result of this agreement, the results of operations for Lite Array's
TFEL display business have been reported as discontinued operations and
previously reported financial statements have been restated to conform to the
current operating structure.

        Net sales. Our net sales consist of our gross invoiced sales less
discounts and returns. Net sales for the 2003 interim period were $61.4 million
as compared to $67.5 million in the 2002 interim period. The decrease in net
sales was mainly attributable to the decrease in kitchen appliance and garment
care product sales, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of floor
care products. In the 2003 interim period, sales of floor care products
increased approximately 27.5% over the 2002 interim period.

        On December 17, 2002, Techtronic Industries Company Limited ("TTI") and
Royal Appliance jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive
agreement for TTI to acquire Royal Appliance. Royal Appliance is one of our
largest customers, representing 42.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2002 and 42.8% of our net sales for the 2003 interim period. Royal
Appliance is not contractually obligated to purchase floor care products from
us, as we only sell to them on the basis of

                                       8

<PAGE>

purchase orders. TTI is a Hong Kong-based manufacturer and marketer of home
improvement products, floor care appliances and electronic measuring devices.
There can be no assurance that after acquiring Royal Appliance, TTI will not
begin to manufacture the floor care products we currently supply to Royal
Appliance or that TTI will not utilize another sub-contractor to manufacture
these products and purchase such products from them. If TTI does manufacture
these products itself or purchase them from another sub-contractor, it could
have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

        Net sales consist primarily of sales in our four major product
categories: kitchen appliances, garment care products, travel products and
accessories and floor care products. Sales in each product category for the 2003
interim period as compared to the 2002 interim period were as follows:

        .  Sales of kitchen appliances decreased to $22.6 million, or 36.7% of
           net sales, from $30.6 million, or 45.3% of net sales, primarily due
           to decreased sales of breadmakers, food steamers, food processors
           and electric knives. These products were once in high demand and
           comprised a significant portion of our revenues in the past. More
           recently, however, demand has waned for these products, and due to
           continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices on these
           products, we have decided to discontinue manufacturing certain of
           these products.

        .  Sales of garment care products decreased to $947,000, or 1.5% of net
           sales, from $6.2 million, or 9.2% of net sales. The decrease in sales
           in this product category in Europe has been significant due to
           decreased sales of steam irons to a major European customer because
           of decreased demand for this product and also the bankruptcy of
           Moulinex S.A., another major European customer which purchased these
           products from us.

        .  Sales of travel products increased to $1.4 million, or 2.4% of net
           sales, from $1.1 million, or 1.7% of net sales, primarily due to
           increased sales of garment steamers which were partially offset by
           the decreased sales of travel irons and travel sets.

        .  Sales of floor care products increased to $33.5 million, or 54.6% of
           net sales, from $26.3 million, or 38.9% of net sales, primarily due
           to sales of carpet shampooers and steam vacuums to new customers and
           a marginal sales increase of floor care products to Royal Appliance.

        Gross profit. Gross profit consists of net sales less cost of goods
sold, which includes the costs of raw materials, production materials, labor,
transportation, depreciation and factory overhead. Gross profit in the 2003
interim period was $16.6 million, or 27.0% of net sales, as compared to $16.0
million, or 23.8% of net sales, in the 2002 interim period. Gross profit as a
percentage of net sales increased in the 2003 interim period primarily because
of a change in product mix and our ability to reduce expenses over the prior
period at a more accelerated rate than net sales decreased. Cost of goods sold
decreased approximately $6.7 million in the 2003 interim period due to decreases
in raw material costs ($5.6 million decrease over the comparable period), direct
and indirect labor costs ($551,000 decrease over the comparable period) and the
cost of fuel, water and electricity ($240,000 decrease over the comparable
period) and other overheads. We plan to continue to retain tight control of
manufacturing overhead such as labor and consumables. Profit margins are
expected to remain relatively stable for the remainder of fiscal 2003. We are,
however, in the process of developing new products and expect to incur
additional overhead and raw material costs in the early production stages that
may offset any further decreases in cost of goods sold.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses. The primary components of
our selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses include expenses
related to product design and development, transportation of finished goods,
salaries for our marketing and administrative personnel, professional fees

                                       9

<PAGE>

and utilities. We have completed the sale of Lite Array's TFEL business to the
former management of Lite Array. Excluding the SG&A expenses incurred by Lite
Array's TFEL business, SG&A expenses in the 2003 interim period increased to
$11.0 million, or 18.0% of net sales, from $10.7 million, or 15.8% of net sales,
in the 2002 interim period. SG&A expenses attributable to Lite Array's TFEL
business were approximately $608,000 and $673,000 in the 2003 and 2002 interim
periods, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the
fees paid to consultants working on new product development and higher
amortization charges, which were partially offset by the decrease in legal and
professional fees, management-related expenses and salaries and wages paid to
administrative staff. We expect SG&A expenses to remain at their current level
for the balance of fiscal 2003.

        The primary components of our design and development expenses included
in SG&A expenses include sample design fees, patent fees, testing charges,
inspection fees and salaries for our engineers and designers. Design and
development expenses in the 2003 interim period were approximately $1.0 million
compared to $1.2 million in the 2002 interim period. The decrease in design and
development expenses was due to a reduction in the number of engineers and
designers responsible for certain discontinued products and a reduction in
testing expenses. We plan to continue to recruit new R&D personnel for new
development programs.

        Operating income. During the 2003 interim period, operating income was
approximately $5.5 million as compared to $5.4 million in the 2002 interim
period, an increase of 3.2% over the prior-year period. The primary reasons for
the increase in operating income was higher gross profit, which was partially
offset by the higher SG&A expenses over the comparable period.

        Interest expense and other income, net. Interest expense consists of
interest on our short- and long-term bank credit facilities. Interest expense
was approximately $48,000 in the 2003 interim period as compared to $112,000 in
the 2002 interim period. The decrease in interest expense was due to decreased
borrowing requirements. Other income, net includes tooling income, interest
income and non-recurring income. Other income, net was $1.2 million in the 2003
interim period as compared to $1.6 million in the 2002 interim period. The
decrease in other income, net was primarily attributable to a decrease in
interest income during the 2003 interim period as interest rates continued to
drop to 1.8% from over 3.0% in the prior period.

        Income tax. We had taxable income in Hong Kong in the 2003 and 2002
interim periods. The financial statements include provisions for Hong Kong
profits tax of approximately $546,000 and $397,000 in the 2003 and 2002 interim
periods, respectively. We do not believe that our current method of operations
subjects us to U.S. taxes because we do not have income effectively connected
with a trade or business in the United States. No income tax was payable by us
in China during this period because our subsidiary in China had accumulated tax
losses during these periods.

        Discontinued operations. We recognized a profit of $29,000 on the sale
of Lite Array's TFEL business. The operating results of this business are
reflected as losses incurred of approximately $1.4 million and $812,000 in the
2002 and 2003 interim periods, respectively.

        Minority interests. During the 2002 interim period, minority
shareholders absorbed approximately $336,000 in losses from the operations of
Global Lite Array (BVI) Ltd. during that period. Due to accumulated losses in
Global Lite Array (BVI), there was no minority interest in the 2003 interim
period.

        Net income. Net income for the 2003 interim period was $5.3 million, or
$0.44 per share, as compared to $5.5 million, or $0.46 per share, for the 2002
interim period.

Three Months ended December 31, 2002 Compared with Three Months ended December
31, 2001

        Net sales. Net sales for the 2003 quarterly period decreased
approximately 15.0% to $16.5 million from $19.5 million in the 2002 quarterly
period. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in
sales of floor care products, kitchen appliances and garment care products. The
decrease in floor care product sales was attributable to a decrease in sales to
Royal Appliance, which was only partially offset by

                                       10

<PAGE>

an approximate $1.0 million increase in sales to new floor care customers. Sales
to Royal Appliance fell due to increased competition based upon price. To help
retain Royal Appliance as a major customer, we recently entered into new
arrangements with Royal Appliance to produce the products we manufacture for
Royal at a lower cost in an attempt to secure additional business in the near
future. These new arrangements may have a negative impact on our profit margins.
While we believe that the additional sales volume from these new arrangements
will make up for any negative impact on our profit margins, Royal Appliance has
no contractual obligation to continue to purchase floor care products from us
and the likelihood of Royal placing additional orders with us is based upon our
ability to compete with the other floor care product manufacturers. Based upon
the new arrangements, we expect sales to Royal Appliance to remain stable
through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

        Sales in each product category for the 2003 quarterly period as
compared to the 2002 quarterly period were as follows:

        .  Sales of kitchen appliances decreased to $7.4 million, or 44.6% of
           net sales, from $8.4 million, or 43.1% of net sales, primarily due to
           decreased sales of breadmakers, food steamers, electric knives and
           food processors. Sales of these products decreased due to significant
           price competition in this product category. Due to overcapacity in
           the business, sales of kitchen appliances are expected to continue to
           decline.

        .  Sales of garment care products decreased to $329,000, or 2.0% of net
           sales, from $1.3 million, or 6.7% of net sales, primarily due to
           decreased sales of steam irons to a major European customer.

        .  Sales of travel products increased to $245,000, or 1.5% of net sales,
           from $239,000, or 1.2% of net sales, primarily due to increased sales
           in garment steamers partially offset by decreased sales in travel
           irons and iron sets.

        .  Sales of floor care products decreased to $7.3 million, or 44.3% of
           net sales, from $8.5 million, or 43.8% of net sales, primarily due to
           decreased sales to Royal Appliance in the 2003 quarterly period.

        Gross profit. Gross profit in the 2003 quarterly period was $4.1
million, or 24.9% of net sales, as compared to $4.7 million, or 24.1% of net
sales, in the 2002 quarterly period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales
increased in the 2003 quarterly period primarily because cost of goods sold
decreased over the prior period at a more accelerated rate than net sales
decreased. Cost of goods sold decreased $2.4 million in the 2003 quarterly
period due to decreases in raw material costs ($2.0 million decrease over the
comparable period) and decreased manufacturing overhead, including direct and
indirect labor costs and the cost of fuel, water and electricity and other
overhead. We plan to continue to retain tight control of manufacturing overhead
such as labor and consumables. We anticipate that gross profit margins will
remain at current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2003. We are, however, in
the process of developing new products, and we expect to incur additional
overhead and raw material costs in the early production stages that may offset
any further decreases in cost of goods sold.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses in the 2003
quarterly period were $3.5 million, or 21.1% of net sales, as compared to $3.3
million, or 16.9% of net sales, in the 2002 quarterly period. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in consultancy fees for new product development and
amortization charges over the comparable quarterly period, which was partially
offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees, management-related expenses
and salaries and wages paid to administrative staff. We have completed the sale
of Lite Array's TFEL business to the former

                                       11

<PAGE>

management of Lite Array. SG&A expenses attributable to Lite Array's TFEL
business were approximately $167,000 and $74,000 in the 2003 and 2002 quarterly
periods, respectively.

        Design and development expenses in the 2003 quarterly period were
$330,000 as compared to $384,000 in the 2002 quarterly period. The decrease in
design and development expenses was due to decreased sample design fees, testing
charges and salaries and wages paid to the design and engineering staff
responsible for certain discontinued products. We plan to continue to recruit
new R&D personnel for new development programs.

        Operating income. During 2003 quarterly period, operating income was
approximately $640,000 as compared to $1.4 million in the 2002 quarterly period,
a decrease of 54.2% over the prior-year period. The primary reasons for the
decrease were decreased sales of floor care, garment care and kitchen appliance
products and higher SG&A expenses over the comparable period.

        Interest expense and other income, net. Interest expense was $15,400 in
the 2003 quarterly period as compared to $19,300 in the 2002 quarterly period.
The decrease in interest expense was due to decreased borrowings. Other income,
net was $413,000 in the 2003 quarterly period as compared to $194,000 in the
2002 quarterly period. The increase in other income, net was primarily
attributable to an increase in tooling payments from our customers.

        Income tax. We had taxable income in Hong Kong in the 2003 and 2002
quarterly periods. The financial statements include provisions for Hong Kong
profits tax of approximately $110,000 and $93,000 in the 2003 and 2002 quarterly
periods, respectively. We do not believe that our current method of operations
subject us to U.S. taxes because we do not have income effectively connected
with a trade or business in the United States. No income tax was payable by us
in China during this period because our subsidiary in China had accumulated tax
losses during these periods.

        Discontinued operations. The operating results of Lite Array's TFEL
business are reflected as losses incurred of approximately $606,000 and $175,000
in the 2002 and 2003 quarterly periods, respectively.

        Minority interests. During the 2002 quarterly period, minority
shareholders absorbed approximately $150,000 in losses from the operations of
Global Lite Array (BVI) Ltd. during that period. Due to accumulated losses in
Global Lite Array (BVI), there was no minority interest in the 2003 quarterly
period.

        Net income. Net income for the 2003 quarterly period was $767,000, or
$0.06 per share, as compared to $1.0 million, or $0.09 per share, in the 2002
quarterly period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        Our primary sources of financing have been cash from operating
activities and borrowings under credit agreements with various banks. Net cash
provided by operating activities during the 2003 interim period was $9.1 million
as compared to approximately $562,000 in the 2002 interim period. During the
2002 interim period, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities
was mainly due to the decrease in accounts receivable over the comparable period
and a reduction in the rate of decrease of accounts payable over the comparable
period. The shift in current asset balances since March 31, 2002 from cash and
cash equivalents to short-term investments reflects our estimated cash reserve
being adequate to meet current liabilities.

                                       12

<PAGE>

        At December 31, 2002, accounts receivable were $9.9 million as compared
to $12.3 million at March 31, 2002 as a result of the decrease in sales during
the 2003 interim period. Receivables at December 31, 2002 represented 44.2 days
of sales as compared to 62.0 days of sales at March 31, 2002. The decrease in
days of sales was caused by the recent decrease in sales to one of our largest
customers, Royal Appliance. We have continued to extend the payment terms for
this customer.

        At December 31, 2002, inventories were $8.1 million as compared to $9.6
million at March 31, 2002. Our inventories consist primarily of raw materials
needed for future production. The decrease was mainly due to our use of raw
materials for the production of floor care products, which were heavily stocked
for the peak production season in the first and second quarters, and the
decreased sales in the 2003 interim period.

        At December 31, 2002, accounts payable were approximately $5.5 million
as compared to $6.2 million at March 31, 2002. The decrease was mainly due to
our payment for raw materials for the production of floor care products, which
were heavily stocked during the peak production period in the first and second
quarters, and the decreased sales in the 2003 interim period. Working capital
increased from $64.9 million at March 31, 2002 to $72.9 million at December 31,
2002 due primarily to an increase in short-term investments, which was partially
offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and a decrease in accounts
payable.

        In October 1998, we made a loan to a start-up U.S. corporation wholly
owned by the spouse of a corporate executive in the original principal amount of
$1.0 million, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.0% and payable in
quarterly installments of approximately $81,000 commencing October 28, 2003,
with any remaining balance due in full on October 28, 2008. As of December 31,
2002, accrued interest on the loan was approximately $340,467. We have reserved
fully against the interest due. As this company is currently in the development
stage, there can be no assurance that the loan will be repaid on a timely basis,
if at all.

        In October 1999, we made a loan to a director for the purchase of a
residence. The loan is in the original principal amount of $460,000, bearing
interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.02%, and is secured by a mortgage on the
property. The loan is payable in six years with annual installments of
approximately $77,000 of principal together with interest on the unpaid
principal balance, commencing October 21, 2000. Payments on the loan will be
forgiven in arrears, however, on each payment due date in consideration for the
director's continued service to us.

        Our aggregate capital expenditures during the 2003 and 2002 interim
periods were approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. During
the 2003 interim period, capital expenditures were mainly incurred for the
acquisition of equipment. Our outstanding capital commitments as of December 31,
2002 were approximately $500,000, primarily for the acquisition of tooling and
purchase of machinery and equipment. We expect to incur an aggregate of
approximately $1.4 million in capital expenses for the expansion of the Dongguan
facility in fiscal 2003 to support our OLED display program. We have commenced
the initial phase of the expansion, involving building a prototype assembly line
incorporating one evaporator which we plan to complete before year end. We
intend to produce samples from this line to determine whether there is
sufficient market interest to support of our plan of building a full scale pilot
line.

        Our revolving credit facilities with Standard Chartered Bank,
HongkongBank and Citibank, N.A. have an aggregate facilities limit of
approximately $35.7 million as of December 31, 2002, bearing interest at
floating commercial bank lending rates in Hong Kong, which ranged from 6.0% to
6.125% per annum as of December 31, 2002. The amounts payable each month on the
revolving credit facilities varies depending upon the amounts drawn at the time
and was $79,000 in December 2002. Our outstanding borrowings vary according to
our seasonal working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2002, the amount
utilized for

                                       13

<PAGE>

overdrafts, bank loans, guarantees and letters of credit under our bank
facilities was approximately $1.3 million.

        As of December 31, 2002, our long-term debt consisted of four term
loans with an aggregate outstanding amount of $968,000 (including the current
portion of long-term debt), all of which was provided by Standard Chartered Bank
under the revolving credit facility to finance the purchase of machinery,
equipment and motor vehicles. These loans bear interest at rates per annum
currently ranging from 2.65% to 6.0% and mature on various dates through the
year 2004. All of such loans are payable in monthly installments which were
approximately $79,000 as of December 31, 2002.

        We anticipate that cash generated from operating activities should be
adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least 18 to 24 months. We
have in the past considered potential acquisitions of complimentary businesses.
Although we have not reached an agreement for such an acquisition, we plan to
continue to pursue selected acquisitions of complementary businesses. In the
event that we should consummate such an acquisition, our capital requirements
could increase.

         Our acquisition of Lite Array, Inc. was completed in May 2001. The
acquisition was accomplished through a newly-formed subsidiary, Global Lite
Array (BVI) Limited, into which we contributed our convertible bond investment
in Lite Array plus $3.8 million of cash. In turn, the former common shareholders
of Lite Array contributed their Lite Array shares into Global Lite Array in
exchange for 9.2% of the outstanding shares of Global Lite Array, and the
holders of Lite Array debt exchanged $4.0 million in Lite Array debt in exchange
for 14.0% of the outstanding shares of Global Lite Array. Lite Array is a
California-based company involved extensively in the research, development and
pre-production of inorganic and organic solid state flat-panel displays. Lite
Array also operates a joint venture manufacturing plant in Jiangmen, China.
Total consideration for our investment in Lite Array was approximately $9.6
million, of which approximately $3.8 million was settled in cash and we took
responsibility for paying for the balance due on a license of $1.8 million. The
remaining portion of the consideration was satisfied in exchange of convertible
notes issued by Lite Array in fiscal 2001.

        As part of our analysis of the potential for Lite Array's TFEL display
business and its joint venture operation, we determined that the long-term
prospects were limited. Global Lite Array's Board of directors decided, at a
June 10, 2002 board meeting, to discontinue the production of TFEL displays and
cease funding the joint venture in China as of September 30, 2002. A
presentation was made regarding this matter to our Board of Directors on June
30, 2002 and a decision was made to write off the value of Lite Array's
investment in the joint venture, the goodwill associated with the TFEL display
business and certain TFEL production equipment owned by us.

        On November 1, 2002, we announced that our subsidiary, Global Lite
Array (BVI) Limited, entered into an agreement to sell Lite Array's TFEL display
business, including the interest that Lite Array owns in a joint venture
manufacturing facility in Jiangmen, China, to the former management of Lite
Array. The net gain on disposal was immaterial.

        The balance due on the small molecule OLED license we assumed as a
result of our acquisition of Lite Array has been paid in full as of December 31,
2002. Payments totaling $1.8 million were made on this license during the 2003
interim period. Pursuant to the license arrangement, Lite Array must pay
royalties of a fixed percentage of the net sales of OLED display products that
are produced by using the licensed know-how and sold by Lite Array and its
subsidiaries before January 1, 2004. Lite Array also must pay royalties of the
greater of a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the net sales of OLED display
products that are produced by using the licensed know-how and sold by Lite Array
and its subsidiaries after January 1, 2004. The license expires in 2023 and may
be terminated at any time by us after January 1, 2004.

        On October 18, 2002, we announced that our Lite Array subsidiary had
acquired a license from Luxell Technologies Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada to
incorporate Luxell's proprietary Black Layer(R) technology in the production of
OLED displays. We believe this technology should further accelerate and support
our recent announcement to concentrate Lite Array's research and development
efforts on OLED displays and our plans to set up a pilot production line for
developing and producing OLED displays.

        Inflation. From 1996 through 2001 and the first eleven months of 2002,
the rate of inflation in Hong Kong has ranged from approximately -6.2% to 6.8%
(approximately -1.7% during 2001) and the average rate of inflation in China has
ranged from approximately -2.1% to 17.0% (approximately -0.4% during 2001). As a
general matter, the effect of this inflation on us is primarily limited to labor
costs, which represent a small component of our total expenses. As we purchase
most of our raw materials outside China, inflation in China does not have a
significant effect on our overall costs.

        Currency and exchange rates. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
Nearly all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of our
expenses, including wages and other production and administrative costs are
denominated in Hong Kong dollars and Chinese Renminbi. Certain raw materials and
other expenses are purchased using a variety of currencies including the U.S.
dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese yen and German mark. The majority of raw

to the U.S. dollar. We have not been significantly affected by exchange rate
fluctuations and therefore have not needed to hedge our positions.
