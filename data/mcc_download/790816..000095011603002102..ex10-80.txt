that the Plan satisfies the conditions of Rule 16b-3, and that Shares are issued
and resold in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

         9. Delivery of Shares. Upon a Vesting Date, the Company shall notify
Grantee (or Grantee's legal representatives, estate or heirs, in the event of
Grantee's death before a Vesting Date) that the restrictions on the Restricted
Shares have lapsed. Within ten (10) business days of a Vesting Date, the Company
shall, without payment from Grantee for the Restricted Shares, deliver to
Grantee a certificate for the Restricted Shares without any legend or
restrictions, except for such restrictions as may be imposed by the Committee,
in its sole judgment, under Paragraph 8, provided that no certificates for
Shares will be delivered to Grantee until appropriate arrangements have been
made with Employer for the withholding of any taxes which may be due with
respect to such Shares. The Company is authorized to withhold from any cash
remuneration then or thereafter payable to Grantee an amount sufficient to cover
required tax withholdings and is further authorized to cancel a number of Shares
for which the restrictions have lapsed having an aggregate Fair Market Value
equal to the required tax withholdings. The Company may condition delivery of
certificates for Shares upon the prior receipt from Grantee of any undertakings
which it may determine are required to assure that the certificates are being
issued in compliance with federal and state securities laws. The right to
payment of any fractional Shares shall be satisfied in cash, measured by the
product of the fractional amount times the fair market value of a Share on the
Vesting Date, as determined by the Committee.

         10. Award Not to Affect Employment. The Award granted hereunder shall
not confer upon Grantee any right to continue in the employment of the Company
or any Subsidiary.
