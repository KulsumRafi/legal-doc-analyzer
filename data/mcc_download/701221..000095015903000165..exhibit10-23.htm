Agreement.</B>You have seven calendar days from the date you sign this Agreement to
revoke and cancel it. To do that, a clear, written cancellation letter, signed by you,
must be received by Kenneth Bottoms, CIGNA Corporation, 1650 Market Street OL54H,
Philadelphia, PA, 19192 before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the seventh calendar day
following the date you sign this Agreement. The Agreement will have no force and effect
until the end of that seventh day.  </P>

Started.</B>You understand and agree that Company&#146;s main reason for entering into
this Agreement is to avoid lawsuits and other litigation. Therefore, if any legal action
covered by paragraph 4 or 9 (other than arbitration of a dispute described in paragraph
9.a or b or claims related to whether your release of ADEA claims was knowing and
voluntary) is started by you (or by someone else on your behalf) against any Released
Person, you agree to pay back to the Company within 30 days of the start of that legal
action all the money you receive under paragraph 3 (except sub-paragraph 3.e) above as
well as any other thing of value received under this Agreement. You also agree to pay the
Company any costs and attorneys&#146;&nbsp;fees it incurs in that action in such action. (If
you claim that your release of ADEA claims was not knowing and voluntary, the Company
reserves its right to recover from you its attorneys&#146;fees and/or costs in defending
that claim, at the conclusion of that action.)  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If in any legal action or arbitration commenced by you (or someone else
on your behalf and with your consent) the release in paragraph 4 is found to be
unenforceable for any reason, then this Agreement shall be null and void from Today on,
and any money paid to you by the Company after Today under paragraph 3 (except
sub-paragraph 3.e and not previously returned to the Company, will be treated as an
overpayment. You will have to repay that overpayment to the Company with interest,
compounded annually at the rate of 6%. However, the repayment provision in this paragraph
does not apply to legal actions in which you claim that your release of ADEA claims was
not knowing and voluntary.  </P>

which you actually performed services and by law you are entitled to receive.  </P>
