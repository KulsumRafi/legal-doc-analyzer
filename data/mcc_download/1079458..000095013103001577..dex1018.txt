             INSTRUMENTS; CHATTEL PAPER AND CERTAIN OTHER COLLATERAL

               3.1 Additional Representations and Warranties. As of the time
when each of its Accounts arises, each Assignor shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that each such Account, and all records, papers and
documents relating thereto (if any) are genuine and what they purport to be, and
that all papers and documents (if any) relating thereto (i) will, to the
knowledge of such Assignor, represent the genuine, legal, valid and binding
obligation of the account debtor evidencing indebtedness unpaid and owed by the
respective account debtor arising out of the performance of labor or services or

will be the only original writings evidencing and embodying such obligation of
the account debtor named therein (other than copies created for general

               3.2 Maintenance of Records. Each Assignor will keep and maintain
at its own cost and expense accurate records of its Accounts and Contracts,
including, but not limited to, originals of all documentation (including each
Contract) with respect thereto, records of all payments received, all credits
granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all other dealings therewith, and
such Assignor will make the same available on such Assignor's premises to the
Collateral Agent for inspection, at such Assignor's own cost and expense, at any
and all reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice to such Assignor and
otherwise in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence and

Collateral Agent, such Assignor shall, at its own cost and expense, deliver all
tangible evidence of its Accounts and Contract Rights (including, without
limitation, all documents evidencing the Accounts and all Contracts) and such
books and records to the

<PAGE>

Collateral Agent or to its representatives (copies of which evidence and books
and records may be retained by such Assignor). Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default and if the Collateral Agent so directs,
such Assignor shall legend, in form and manner satisfactory to the Collateral
Agent, the Accounts and the Contracts, as well as books, records and documents
(if any) of such Assignor evidencing or pertaining to such Accounts and
Contracts with an appropriate reference to the fact that such Accounts and
Contracts have been assigned to the Collateral Agent and that the Collateral
Agent has a security interest therein.

               3.3 Direction to Account Debtors; Contracting Parties; Etc. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, if the
Collateral Agent so directs any Assignor, such Assignor agrees (x) to cause all
payments on account of the Accounts and Contracts to be made directly to the
Cash Collateral Account, (y) that the Collateral Agent may, at its option,
directly notify the obligors with respect to any Accounts and/or under any
Contracts to make payments with respect thereto as provided in the preceding
clause (x), and (z) that the Collateral Agent may enforce collection of any such
Accounts and Contracts and may adjust, settle or compromise the amount of
payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as such Assignor.
Without notice to or assent by any Assignor, the Collateral Agent may, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, apply any or all
amounts then in, or thereafter deposited in, the Cash Collateral Account toward
the payment of the Obligations in the manner provided in Section 7.4 of this
Agreement. The reasonable costs and expenses of collection (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), whether incurred by an Assignor or the Collateral Agent, shall
be borne by the relevant Assignor. The Collateral Agent shall deliver a copy of
each notice referred to in the preceding clause (y) to the relevant Assignor,
provided that (x) the failure by the Collateral Agent to so notify such Assignor
shall not affect the effectiveness of such notice or the other rights of the
Collateral Agent created by this subsection 3.3 and (y) no such notice shall be
required if an Event of Default of the type described in subsections 8.6 and 8.7
of the Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing.

               3.4 Modification of Terms; Etc. Except in accordance with such
Assignor's ordinary course of business and consistent with reasonable business
judgment, no Assignor shall rescind or cancel any indebtedness evidenced by any
Account or under any Contract, or modify any material term thereof or make any
material adjustment with respect thereto, or extend or renew the same, or
compromise or settle any material dispute, claim, suit or legal proceeding
relating thereto, or sell any Account or Contract, or interest therein, without
the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent. No Assignor will do anything
to adversely affect the right, title and interest of the Collateral Agent in the
Accounts or Contracts, except as permitted this Section 3.4 and Section 3.5.

               3.5 Collection. Each Assignor shall endeavor in accordance with
reasonable business practices to cause to be collected from the account debtor
named in each of its Accounts or obligor under any Contract, as and when due
(including, without limitation, amounts which are delinquent, such amounts to be
collected in accordance with generally accepted lawful collection procedures)
any and all amounts owing under or on account of such Account or Contract, and
apply forthwith upon receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the
outstanding balance of such Account or under such Contract. Except as otherwise
directed by the Collateral Agent after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, any Assignor may allow in the ordinary
course of business as adjustments to amounts owing under

                                       -8-

its Accounts and Contracts (i) an extension or renewal of the time or times of
payment, or settlement for less than the total unpaid balance, which such
Assignor finds appropriate in accordance with reasonable business judgment and
(ii) a refund or credit due as a result of returned or damaged merchandise or
improperly performed services or for other reasons which such Assignor finds
appropriate in accordance with reasonable business judgment. The reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
of collection, whether incurred by an Assignor or the Collateral Agent, shall be
borne by the relevant Assignor.

               3.6 Instruments. If any Assignor owns or acquires any Instrument
in excess of $750,000 constituting Collateral (other than checks and other
payment instruments received and collected in the ordinary course of business),
such Assignor will within 30 Business Days notify the Collateral Agent thereof,
and upon request by the Collateral Agent will promptly deliver such Instrument
to the Collateral Agent appropriately endorsed to the order of the Collateral
Agent.

               3.7 Assignors Remain Liable Under Accounts. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Assignors shall remain liable under each of
the Accounts to observe and perform all of the conditions and obligations to be
observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any
agreement giving rise to such Accounts. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any
other Secured Creditor shall have any obligation or liability under any Account
(or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this
Agreement or the receipt by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor
of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor shall the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor be obligated in any manner to
perform any of the obligations of any Assignor under or pursuant to any Account
(or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry
as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by them or as to the
sufficiency of any performance by any party under any Account (or any agreement
giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim, to take any action to
enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have
been assigned to them or to which they may be entitled at any time or times.

               3.8 Assignors Remain Liable Under Contracts. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Assignors shall remain liable under each of
the Contracts to observe and perform all of the conditions and obligations to be
observed and performed by them thereunder, all in accordance with and pursuant
to the terms and provisions of each Contract. Neither the Collateral Agent nor
any other Secured Creditor shall have any obligation or liability under any
Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor of any payment relating to such
Contract pursuant hereto, nor shall the Collateral Agent or any other Secured
Creditor be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any
Assignor under or pursuant to any Contract, to make any payment, to make any
inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any performance by any party
under any Contract, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce
any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been
assigned to them or to which they may be entitled at any time or times.

               3.9 Deposit Accounts; Etc. (a) No Assignor maintains, or at any
time after the date of this Agreement shall establish or maintain, any demand,
time, savings, passbook or

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

similar account, except for such accounts maintained with a bank (as defined in
Section 9-102 of the UCC) whose jurisdiction (determined in accordance with
Section 9-304 of the UCC) is within a State of the United States. Annex F hereto
accurately sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, for each Assignor, each
Deposit Account maintained by such Assignor (including a description thereof and
the respective account number), the name of the respective bank with which such
Deposit Account is maintained, and the jurisdiction of the respective bank with
respect to such Deposit Account. Upon the occurrence and continuation of a
Specified Collateral Event or an Event of Default, if requested by the
Collateral Agent, for each Deposit Account (other than the Cash Collateral
Account or any other Deposit Account maintained with the Collateral Agent), the
respective Assignor shall cause the bank with which the Deposit Account is
maintained to execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent, within 30 days after
the date of the occurrence of such Specified Collateral Event or Event of
Default, a "control agreement" in the form of Annex G hereto (appropriately
completed), with such changes thereto as may be acceptable to the Collateral
Agent. If any bank with which a Deposit Account is maintained refuses to, or
does not, enter into such a "control agreement", then the respective Assignor
shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days after the occurrence of the
Specified Collateral Event or the Event of Default, as the case may be) close
the respective Deposit Account and transfer all balances therein to the Cash
Collateral Account or another Deposit Account meeting the requirements of this
Section 3.9. If any bank with which a Deposit Account is maintained refuses to
subordinate all its claims with respect to such Deposit Account to the
Collateral Agent's security interest therein on terms satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent, then the Collateral Agent, at its option, may (x) require that
such Deposit Account be terminated in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence or (y) agree to a "control agreement" without such subordination,
provided that in such event the Collateral Agent may at any time, at its option,
subsequently require that such Deposit Account be terminated (within 30 days
after notice from the Collateral Agent) in accordance with the requirements of
the immediately preceding sentence.

               (b)    After the date of this Agreement, no Assignor shall
establish any new demand, time, savings, passbook or similar account, except for
Deposit Accounts established and maintained with banks and meeting the
requirements of preceding clause (a). At the time any such Deposit Account is
established, the appropriate "control agreement" shall be entered into in
accordance with the requirements of preceding clause (a) and the respective
Assignor shall furnish to the Collateral Agent a supplement to Annex E hereto
containing the relevant information with respect to the respective Deposit
Account and the bank with which same is established.

               3.10 Letter-of-Credit Rights. If any Assignor is at any time a
beneficiary under a letter of credit with a stated amount of $1,000,000 or more,
such Assignor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the
request of the Collateral Agent, such Assignor shall, pursuant to an agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange for the issuer and any confirmer of such
letter of credit to consent to an assignment to the Collateral Agent of the
proceeds of any drawing under such letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the
Collateral Agent to become the transferee beneficiary of such letter of credit,
with the Collateral Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any
drawing under the letter of credit are to be applied as provided in this
Agreement after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, provided, that any Letters of Credit constituting Supporting
Obligations shall be excluded from the requirements of this

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

Section 3.10.

               3.11 Commercial Tort Claims. All Commercial Tort Claims of each
Assignor in existence on the date of this Agreement are described in Annex H
hereto. If any Assignor shall at any time after the date of this Agreement
acquire a Commercial Tort Claim in an amount (taking the greater of the
aggregate claimed damages thereunder or the reasonably estimated value thereof)
of $1,000,000 or more, such Assignor shall within 30 days thereof notify the
Collateral Agent thereof in a writing signed by such Assignor and describing the
details thereof and shall grant to the Collateral Agent in such writing a
security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of
this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

               3.12 Chattel Paper. Upon the request of the Collateral Agent made
at any time or from time to time, each Assignor shall within 30 days furnish to
the Collateral Agent a list of all Electronic Chattel Paper held or owned by
such Assignor. Furthermore, if requested by the Collateral Agent, upon the
occurrence and continuation of a Specified Collateral Event or an Event of
Default, each Assignor shall promptly take all actions which are reasonably
practicable so that the Collateral Agent has "control" of all Electronic Chattel
Paper in accordance with the requirements of Section 9-105 of the UCC. Each
Assignor will promptly (and in any event within 30 days) following any request
by the Collateral Agent made in accordance with the foregoing sentence, deliver
all of its Tangible Chattel Paper to the Collateral Agent.

               3.13 Further Actions. Each Assignor will, at its own expense,
make, execute, endorse, acknowledge, file and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent
from time to time such vouchers, invoices, schedules, confirmatory assignments,
conveyances, financing statements, transfer endorsements, certificates, reports
and other assurances or instruments and take such further steps, including any
and all actions as may be necessary or required under the Federal Assignment of
Claims Act, relating to its Accounts, Contracts, Instruments and other property
or rights covered by the security interest hereby granted, as the Collateral
Agent may reasonably require.

of any other Person other than as could not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Assignor represents and

use all material U.S. trademark registrations and applications and Domain Name
registrations listed in Annex I hereto and that said registrations are valid,
subsisting, have not been canceled and that such Assignor is not aware of any
third-party claim that any of said registrations is invalid or unenforceable,
and is not aware that there is any reason that any of said registrations is
invalid or unenforceable. Each Assignor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent an
absolute power of attorney to sign, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, any document which may be required by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office or similar registrar in order to
effect an absolute assignment of all right, title and interest in each Mark
and/or Domain Name, and record the same.

               4.2 Licenses and Assignments. Except as otherwise permitted by

thereof, to notify the Collateral Agent in writing of the name and address of,
and to furnish such pertinent information that may be available with respect to,
any party who such Assignor believes is, or may be, infringing or diluting or
otherwise violating any of such Assignor's rights in and to any Mark or Domain
Name in any manner that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or with respect to any party claiming that such Assignor's use of any
Mark or Domain Name material to such Assignor's business violates in any
material respect any property right of that party. Each Assignor further agrees
to prosecute in accordance with reasonable business practices any Person
infringing any Mark or Domain Name in any manner that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               4.4 Preservation of Marks and Domain Names. Each Assignor agrees
to use its Marks and Domain Names which are material to such Assignor's business

fees and disbursements in connection therewith and shall not abandon any such
filing of affidavit of use or any such application of renewal prior to the
exhaustion of all administrative and judicial remedies without prior written
consent of the Collateral Agent (other than with respect to registrations and
applications deemed by such Assignor in its reasonable business judgment to be
no longer prudent to pursue).

               4.6 Future Registered Marks and Domain Names. If any Mark or
Domain Name registration that is material to its business is issued hereafter to
any Assignor as a result of any application now or hereafter pending before the

Assignor, within 30 days of receipt of such certificate or

                                      -12-

Agent a copy of such certificate or similar indicia of ownership, and a grant of
a security interest in such Mark and/or Domain Name, to the Collateral Agent and
at the expense of such Assignor, confirming grant of a security interest in such
Mark and/or Domain Name to the Collateral Agent hereunder, the form of such
security to be substantially in the form of Annex L hereto or in such other form
as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

               4.7 Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Collateral Agent may, by written notice to the relevant
Assignor, take any or all of the following actions, subject to the limitations
of the Uniform Commercial Code in the applicable jurisdictions: (i) declare the

in Section 4.1 hereof to execute, cause to be acknowledged and notarized and
record said absolute assignment with the applicable agency; (ii) take and use or
sell the Marks or Domain Names and the goodwill of such Assignor's business
symbolized by the Marks or Domain Names and the right to carry on the business
and use the assets of such Assignor in connection with which the Marks or Domain
Names have been used; and (iii) direct such Assignor to refrain, in which event
such Assignor shall refrain, from using the Marks or Domain Names in any manner
whatsoever, directly or indirectly, and such Assignor shall execute such further
documents that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to further confirm
this and to transfer ownership of the Marks or Domain Names and registrations
and any pending trademark application in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or applicable Domain Name registrar to the Collateral Agent.

any third party claim that any aspect of such Assignor's present or contemplated
business operations infringes or will infringe any patent of any other Person or
such Assignor has misappropriated any trade secret or proprietary information
which, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Assignor hereby grants to the Collateral
Agent an absolute power of attorney to sign, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any document which may be required by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to effect an absolute
assignment of all right, title and interest in each

thereof, to furnish the Collateral Agent in writing with all pertinent
information available to such Assignor with respect to any infringement,
contributing infringement or active inducement to infringe in any Patent or
Copyright or to any claim that the practice of any Patent or use of any
Copyright violates any property right of a third party, or with respect to any
misappropriation of any Trade Secret Right or any claim that practice of any
Trade Secret Right violates any property right of a third party, in each case,
in any manner which, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Assignor further agrees,
absent direction of the Collateral Agent to the contrary, to diligently
prosecute, in accordance with its reasonable business judgment, any Person
infringing any Patent or Copyright or any Person misappropriating any Trade
Secret Right, in each case to the extent that such infringement or
misappropriation, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

each Assignor shall make timely payment of all post-issuance fees required
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 41 to maintain in force its rights under each
Patent or Copyright, absent prior written consent of the Collateral Agent (other
than any such Patents or Copyrights which are no longer used or are deemed by
such Assignor in its reasonable business judgment to no longer be useful in its
business or operations).

               5.5 Prosecution of Patent or Copyright Applications. At its own

registration of, or application therefor, as the case may be, with a grant of a
security interest as to such Patent or Copyright, as the case may be, to the
Collateral Agent and at the expense of such Assignor, confirming the grant of a
security interest, the form of such grant of a security interest to be
substantially in the form of Annex M or N hereto, as appropriate, or in such
other form as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

               5.7 Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Collateral Agent may, by written notice to the relevant
Assignor, take any or all of the following actions, subject to the limitations

                                   ARTICLE VI

                      PROVISIONS CONCERNING ALL COLLATERAL

               6.1 Protection of Collateral Agent's Security. Except as
otherwise permitted by the Secured Debt Agreements, each Assignor will do
nothing to adversely affect the right, title and interest of the Collateral
Agent in the Collateral. Each Assignor will at all times maintain insurance, at
such Assignor's own expense to the extent and in the manner provided in the
Secured Debt Agreements. Except to the extent otherwise permitted to be retained
by such Assignor or applied by such Assignor pursuant to the terms of the
Secured Debt Agreements, the Collateral Agent shall, at the time any proceeds of
such insurance are distributed to the Secured Creditors, apply such proceeds in
accordance with Section 7.4 hereof. Each Assignor assumes all liability and
responsibility in connection with the Collateral acquired by it and the
liability of such Assignor to pay the Obligations shall in no way be affected or
diminished by reason of the fact that such Collateral may be lost, destroyed,
stolen, damaged or for any reason whatsoever unavailable to such Assignor.

               6.2 Warehouse Receipts Non-negotiable. To the extent practicable,
each Assignor agrees that if any warehouse receipt or receipt in the nature of a
warehouse receipt is issued with respect to any of its Inventory such Assignor
shall notify the Collateral Agent of the existence of such receipt within 30
days of the issuance thereof and upon the occurrence and continuation of a
Specified Collateral Event or an Event of Default, upon the request of the
Collateral Agent, such Assignor shall request that such warehouse receipt or
receipt in the nature thereof shall not be "negotiable" (as such term is used in
Section 7-104 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant
jurisdiction or under other relevant law).

               6.3 Additional Information. Each Assignor will, at its own
expense, from time to time upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent,
promptly (and in any event within 10 days after its receipt of the respective
request) furnish to the Collateral Agent such information with respect to the
Collateral (including the identity of the Collateral or such components thereof
as may have been requested by the Collateral Agent, the value and location of
such Collateral, etc.) as may be requested by the Collateral Agent. Without
limiting the forgoing, each Assignor agrees that it shall promptly (and in any
event within 10 business days after its receipt of the respective request)
furnish to the Collateral Agent such updated Annexes hereto as may from time to
time be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent.

                                      -15-

               6.4 Further Actions. Each Assignor will, at its own expense and
upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, make, execute, endorse,
acknowledge, file and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent from time to time such
lists, descriptions and designations of its Collateral, warehouse receipts,
receipts in the nature of warehouse receipts, bills of lading, documents of
title, vouchers, invoices, schedules, confirmatory assignments, conveyances,
financing statements, transfer endorsements, certificates, reports and other
assurances or instruments and take such further steps relating to the Collateral
and other property or rights covered by the security interest hereby granted,
which the Collateral Agent deems reasonably appropriate or advisable to perfect,
preserve or protect its security interest in the Collateral.

               6.5 Financing Statements. Each Assignor agrees to execute and
deliver to the Collateral Agent such financing statements, in form reasonably
acceptable to the Collateral Agent, as the Collateral Agent may from time to
time reasonably request or as are reasonably necessary or desirable in the
opinion of the Collateral Agent to establish and maintain a valid, enforceable,
perfected security interest in the Collateral as provided herein and the other
rights and security contemplated hereby. Each Assignor will pay any applicable
filing fees, recordation taxes and related expenses relating to its Collateral.
Each Assignor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file any such financing
statements and amendments thereto without the signature of such Assignor where
permitted by law (and such authorization includes describing the Collateral as
"all assets" of such Assignor).

                                   ARTICLE VII

                 REMEDIES UPON OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

               7.1 Remedies; Obtaining the Collateral Upon Default. Each

any rights now or hereafter existing under applicable law and under the other
provisions of this Agreement, shall have all rights as a secured creditor under
any UCC, and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured creditor is
entitled under the laws in effect in all relevant jurisdictions and may to the

         possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, from such Assignor or
         any other Person who then has possession of any part thereof with or
         without notice or process of law, and for that purpose may enter upon
         such Assignor's premises where any of the Collateral is located and
         remove the same and use in connection with such removal any and all
         services, supplies, aids and other facilities of such Assignor;

               (ii)   instruct the obligor or obligors on any agreement,
         instrument or other obligation (including, without limitation, the
         Accounts and the Contracts) constituting the Collateral to make any
         payment required by the terms of such agreement, instrument or other
         obligation directly to the Collateral Agent and may exercise any and
         all remedies of such Assignor in respect of such Collateral;

                                      -16-

         any or all of the Collateral or any part thereof, and, in each case,
         take possession of the proceeds of any such sale or liquidation;

               (v)    take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, by
         directing the relevant Assignor in writing to deliver the same to the
         Collateral Agent at any reasonable place or places designated by the
         Collateral Agent, in which event such Assignor shall at its own
         expense:

                      (x)   forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or
                  places so designated by the Collateral Agent and there
                  delivered to the Collateral Agent;

                      (y)   store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the
                  Collateral Agent at such place or places pending further
                  action by the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 7.2
                  hereof; and

                      (z)   while the Collateral shall be so stored and kept,
                  provide such security and maintenance services as shall be
                  reasonably necessary to protect the same and to preserve and
                  maintain it in good condition;

               (vi)   license or sublicense, whether on an exclusive or
         nonexclusive basis, any Marks, Domain Names, Patents or Copyrights
         included in the Collateral for such term and on such conditions and in
         such manner as the Collateral Agent shall in its sole judgment
         determine;

               (vii)  apply any monies constituting Collateral or proceeds
         thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.4; and

               (viii) take any other action as specified in clauses (1) through
         (5), inclusive, of Section 9-607 of the UCC;

it being understood that each Assignor's obligation so to deliver the Collateral
is of the essence of this Agreement and that, accordingly, upon application to a
court of equity having jurisdiction, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to a
decree requiring specific performance by such Assignor of said obligation. By
accepting the benefits of this Agreement and each other Collateral Document, the
Secured Creditors expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and each
other Collateral Document may be enforced only by the action of the Collateral
Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Secured Creditors and that no
other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce this
Agreement or any other Collateral Document or to realize upon the security to be
granted hereby or thereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors upon the terms of this Agreement and the other Collateral Documents.

               7.2 Remedies; Disposition of the Collateral. If any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then any Collateral repossessed
by the Collateral Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof and any other
Collateral whether or not so repossessed by the Collateral Agent, may be sold,
assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts or as an
entirety, and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale the
property to be sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at
such place or places and on such terms as the Collateral Agent may, in
compliance with any mandatory requirements of applicable law, determine to be
commercially reasonable. Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise
disposed of, in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the
Collateral Agent or after any overhaul or repair at the expense of the relevant
Assignor which the Collateral Agent shall determine to be commercially
reasonable. Any such sale, lease or other disposition may be effected by means
of a public disposition or private disposition, effected in accordance with the
applicable requirements (in each case if and to the extent applicable) of
Sections 9-610 through 9-613 of the UCC and/or such other mandatory requirements
of applicable law as may apply to the respective disposition. The Collateral
Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private
disposition or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement
at the time and place fixed for the disposition, and such disposition may be
made at any time or place to which the disposition may be so adjourned. To the
extent permitted by any such requirement of law, the Collateral Agent may bid
for and become the purchaser (and may pay all or any portion of the purchase
price by crediting Obligations against the purchase price) of the Collateral or
any item thereof, offered for disposition in accordance with this Section 7.2
without accountability to the relevant Assignor. If, under applicable law, the
Collateral Agent shall be permitted to make disposition of the Collateral within
a period of time which does not permit the giving of notice to the relevant
Assignor as hereinabove specified, the Collateral Agent need give such Assignor
only such notice of disposition as shall be required by such applicable law.
Each Assignor agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as
may be reasonably necessary to make such disposition or dispositions of all or
any portion of the Collateral valid and binding and in compliance with any and
all applicable laws, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or awards
of any and all courts, arbitrators or governmental instrumentalities, domestic
or foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sale or sales, all at such
Assignor's expense.

               7.3 Waiver of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, EACH ASSIGNOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, NOTICE AND JUDICIAL HEARING IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S
TAKING POSSESSION OR THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S DISPOSITION OF ANY OF THE
COLLATERAL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL PRIOR NOTICE AND HEARING
FOR ANY PREJUDGMENT REMEDY OR REMEDIES, and each Assignor hereby further waives,
to the extent permitted by law:

               (i)    all damages occasioned by such taking of possession or any
         such disposition except any damages which are the direct result of the
         Collateral Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct;

               (ii)   all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of
         sale or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the
         Collateral Agent's rights hereunder; and

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

               (iii)  all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay,
         extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable
         law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or
         the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, and each
         Assignor, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or
         they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all
         such laws.

Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon,
any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and
demand, either at law or in equity, of the relevant Assignor therein and
thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against such
Assignor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the
Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from,
through and under such Assignor.

               7.4 Application of Proceeds. (a) All moneys collected by the
Collateral Agent (or, to the extent the Pledge Agreement or any other Collateral
Document requires proceeds of collateral under such other Collateral Document to
be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Pledgee or
Collateral Agent under such other Collateral Document) upon any sale or other
disposition of the Collateral, together with all other moneys received by the
Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

               (i)    first, to the payment of all amounts owing the Collateral
         Agent of the type described in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of the
         definition of "Obligations";

               (ii)   second, to the extent proceeds remain after the
         application pursuant to the preceding clause (i), to the payment of all
         amounts owing to any Agent of the type described in clauses (v) and
         (vi) of the definition of "Obligations";

               (iii)  third, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
         pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), an amount equal to the
         outstanding Primary Obligations shall be paid to the Secured Creditors
         as provided in Section 7.4(e) hereof, with each Secured Creditor
         receiving an amount equal to its outstanding Primary Obligations or, if
         the proceeds are insufficient to pay in full all such Primary
         Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of the amount remaining to be
         distributed;

               (iv)   fourth, to the extent proceeds remain after the
         application pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) through (iii),
         inclusive, an amount equal to the outstanding Secondary Obligations
         shall be paid to the Secured Creditors as provided in Section 7.4(e)
         hereof, with each Secured Creditor receiving an amount equal to its
         outstanding Secondary Obligations or, if the proceeds are insufficient
         to pay in full all such Secondary Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of
         the amount remaining to be distributed; and

               (v)    fifth, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
         pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), inclusive, and
         following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.8(a)
         hereof, to the relevant Assignor or to whomever may be lawfully
         entitled to receive such surplus.

               (b)    For purposes of this Agreement, (x) "Pro Rata Share" shall
mean, when calculating a Secured Creditor's portion of any distribution or
amount, that amount (expressed as

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

a percentage) equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the then unpaid
amount of such Secured Creditor's Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations,
as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the then outstanding amount
of all Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, (y)
"Primary Obligations" shall mean (i) in the case of the Loan Document
Obligations, all principal of, premium, fees and interest on, all Loans, all
amounts of unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit, the stated amount of
all outstanding Letters of Credit and all fees with respect to Letters of Credit
and (ii) in the case of the Other Obligations, all amounts due under such
Secured Hedging Agreements (other than indemnities, fees (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees) and similar obligations and liabilities) and (z)
"Secondary Obligations" shall mean all Obligations other than Primary
Obligations.

               (c)    When payments to Secured Creditors are based upon their
respective Pro Rata Shares, the amounts received by such Secured Creditors
hereunder shall be applied (for purposes of making determinations under this
Section 7.4 only) (i) first, to their Primary Obligations and (ii) second, to
their Secondary Obligations. If any payment to any Secured Creditor of its Pro
Rata Share of any distribution would result in overpayment to such Secured
Creditor, such excess amount shall instead be distributed in respect of the
unpaid Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of the
other Secured Creditors, with each Secured Creditor whose Primary Obligations or
Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, have not been paid in full to receive
an amount equal to such excess amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the unpaid Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case
may be, of such Secured Creditor and the denominator of which is the unpaid
Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of all Secured
Creditors entitled to such distribution.

               (d)    Each of the Secured Creditors, by their acceptance of the
benefits hereof and of the other Collateral Documents, agrees and acknowledges
that if the Lender Creditors receive a distribution on account of undrawn
amounts with respect to Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement
(which shall only occur after all outstanding Revolving Loans under the Credit
Agreement and unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit have been paid in
full), such amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent under the Credit
Agreement and held by it, for the equal and ratable benefit of the Lender
Creditors, as cash security for the repayment of Obligations owing to the Lender
Creditors as such. If any amounts are held as cash security pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, then upon the termination of all outstanding
Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, and after the application of all
such cash security to the repayment of all Obligations owing to the Lender
Creditors after giving effect to the termination of all such Letters of Credit,
if there remains any excess cash, such excess cash shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to the Collateral Agent for distribution in accordance with
Section 7.4(a) hereof.

               (e)    All payments required to be made hereunder shall be made
(x) if to the Lender Creditors, to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lender Creditors and (y) if to the Other Creditors, to the trustee, paying
agent or other similar representative (each a "Representative") for the Other
Creditors or, in the absence of such a Representative, directly to the Other
Creditors.

               (f)    For purposes of applying payments received in accordance
with this Section 7.4, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon (i)
the Administrative Agent and

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

(ii) the Representative or, in the absence of such a Representative, upon the
Other Creditors for a determination (which the Administrative Agent, each
Representative and the Other Creditors agree (or shall agree) to provide upon
request of the Collateral Agent) of the outstanding Primary Obligations and
Secondary Obligations owed to the Lender Creditors or the Other Creditors, as
the case may be. Unless it has received written notice from a Lender Creditor or
an Other Creditor to the contrary, the Administrative Agent and each
Representative, in furnishing information pursuant to the preceding sentence,
and the Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to assume that
no Secondary Obligations are outstanding. Unless it has written notice from an
Other Creditor to the contrary, the Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall
be entitled to assume that no Secured Hedging Agreements are in existence.

               (g)    This Agreement is made with full recourse to each Assignor
(including, without limitation, with full recourse to all assets of such
Assignor) and pursuant to and upon all the warranties, representations,
covenants and agreements on the part of such Assignor contained herein, in the
other Secured Debt Agreements and otherwise in writing in connection herewith or
therewith. It is understood that the Assignors shall remain jointly and
severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the
proceeds of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Obligations.

               7.5 Remedies Cumulative. Each and every right, power and remedy
hereby specifically given to the Collateral Agent shall be in addition to every
other right, power and remedy specifically given to the Collateral Agent under
this Agreement, the other Secured Debt Agreements or now or hereafter existing
at law, in equity or by statute and each and every right, power and remedy
whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from
time to time or simultaneously and as often and in such order as may be deemed
expedient by the Collateral Agent. All such rights, powers and remedies shall be
cumulative and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of one shall not be
deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other or others. No delay or
omission of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any such right, power or
remedy and no renewal or extension of any of the Obligations shall impair any
such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence thereof. No
notice to or demand on any Assignor in any case shall entitle it to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent to any other or further
action in any circumstances without notice or demand. In the event that the
Collateral Agent shall bring any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and
shall be entitled to judgment, then in such suit the Collateral Agent may
recover reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the
amounts thereof shall be included in such judgment.

               7.6 Discontinuance of Proceedings. In case the Collateral Agent
shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under
this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding
shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been
determined adversely to the Collateral Agent, then and in every such case the
relevant Assignor, except to the extent otherwise prohibited by such
determination, the Collateral Agent and each holder of any of the Obligations
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to
the Collateral subject to the security interest created under this Agreement,
and all rights, remedies and powers of the Collateral Agent shall continue as if
no such proceeding had been instituted.

               8.1 Indemnity. (a) Each Assignor jointly and severally agrees to
indemnify, reimburse and hold the Collateral Agent, each other Secured Creditor
and their respective successors, assigns, employees, affiliates and agents
(hereinafter in this Section 8.1 referred to individually as "Indemnitee," and
collectively as "Indemnitees") harmless from any and all liabilities,
obligations, damages, injuries, penalties, claims, demands, actions, suits,
judgments and any and all costs, expenses or disbursements (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) (for the purposes of this Section 8.1 the
foregoing are collectively called "expenses") of whatsoever kind and nature
imposed on, asserted against or incurred by any of the Indemnitees in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Secured Debt Agreement
or any other document executed in connection herewith or therewith or in any
other way connected with the administration of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms of, or the preservation
of any rights under any thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of the
manufacture, ownership, ordering, purchase, delivery, control, acceptance,
lease, financing, possession, operation, condition, sale, return or other
disposition, or use of the Collateral (including, without limitation, latent or
other defects, whether or not discoverable), the violation of the laws of any
country, state or other governmental body or unit, any tort (including, without
limitation, claims arising or imposed under the doctrine of strict liability, or
for or on account of injury to or the death of any Person (including any
Indemnitee), or property damage), or contract claim; provided that no Indemnitee
shall be indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) for losses, damages or
liabilities to the extent caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. Each Assignor agrees that upon written notice by
any Indemnitee of the assertion of such a liability, obligation, damage, injury,
penalty, claim, demand, action, suit or judgment, the relevant Assignor shall
assume full responsibility for the defense thereof. Each Indemnitee agrees to
use its best efforts to promptly notify the relevant Assignor of any such
assertion of which such Indemnitee has knowledge.

               (b)    Without limiting the application of Section 8.1(a) hereof,
each Assignor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay or reimburse the Collateral
Agent for any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of whatever kind or
nature incurred in connection with the creation, preservation or protection of
the Collateral Agent's Liens on, and security interest in, the Collateral,
including, without limitation, all fees and taxes in connection with the
recording or filing of instruments and documents in public offices, payment or
discharge of any taxes or Liens upon or in respect of the Collateral, premiums
for insurance with respect to the Collateral and all other fees, costs and
expenses in connection with protecting, maintaining or preserving the Collateral
and the Collateral Agent's interest therein, whether through judicial
proceedings or otherwise, or in defending or prosecuting any actions, suits or
proceedings arising out of or relating to the Collateral.

               (c)    Without limiting the application of Section 8.1(a) or (b)
hereof, each Assignor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay, indemnify and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from and against any loss, costs, damages and expenses
which such Indemnitee may suffer, expend or incur in consequence of or growing
out of any misrepresentation by any Assignor in

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

this Agreement, any other Secured Debt Agreement or in any writing contemplated
by or made or delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Secured Debt Agreement.

               (d)    If and to the extent that the obligations of any Assignor
under this Section 8.1 are unenforceable for any reason, such Assignor hereby
agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable law.

               8.2 Indemnity Obligations Secured by Collateral; Survival. Any
amounts paid by any Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee has the right to
reimbursement shall constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral. The
indemnity obligations of each Assignor contained in this Article VIII shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the full payment of all of the
other Obligations and notwithstanding the full payment of all the Notes issued,
and Loans made, under the Credit Agreement, the termination of all Letters of
Credit issued under the Credit Agreement, the termination of all Secured Hedging
Agreements entered into with the Other Creditors and the payment of all other
Obligations and notwithstanding the discharge thereof and the occurrence of the
Termination Date.
