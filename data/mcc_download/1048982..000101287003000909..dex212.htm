not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of Securityholder Agent. In the event that the Securityholder Agent is not entitled to assume the defense of
Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to
the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and Parent or its affiliates need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Securityholder Agent in connection therewith); provided, however, that except with the written consent
of the Securityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be determinative of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund. In each case, Parent or
its affiliates shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Securityholder Agent will cooperate with Parent or its affiliates, and will use his best efforts to cause the Escrow Participants, to cooperate in the
defense of that claim, will provide full access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by Parent and material to the claim and will make available all individuals reasonably requested by Parent for investigation,
depositions and trial.&#148; </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">1.8 <U>Amendment of
