Associate acknowledges the confidential and sensitive nature of Confidential Information, and that the use or disclosure of, or even the appearance of the use or disclosure of, the Confidential

which ADSI agrees to provide to Associate and ADSI's disclosure of additional Confidential Information as part of that training, including ADSI trade secrets, Associate shall not, within the
Designated Geographical Area (defined below), until the expiration of 24 calendar months after the date on which Associate's employment with ADSI terminates (regardless of the circumstances in which
the employment has ended), engage, directly or indirectly, in any business, enterprise or employment that is competitive with those aspects of ADSI's Business (defined above) in which Associate was
involved or aware (hereinafter the "Non-Competition Covenant"). ADSI and Associate agree that this Non-Competition Covenant is fair and reasonable. </FONT></P>

ADSI and Associate have, in good faith, used their best efforts to make the limitations and scope of the Non-Competition Covenant reasonable, and it is not anticipated or intended
by either party to this Agreement that any court of competent jurisdiction would find the Non-Competition Covenant unreasonable, in the event that a court should conclude that the
Non-Competition Covenant is unreasonable, Associate and ADSI agree that the provisions should be reformed to restrict Associate's competition with ADSI to the maximum extent enforceable to
adequately protect Confidential Information and ADSI's interests, including ADSI trade secrets. </FONT></P>
