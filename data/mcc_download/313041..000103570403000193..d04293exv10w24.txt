Re: Warrant to be Issued Pursuant to Edgewater Guarantee of Additional Bank Debt

Dear Richard:

      Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank") has agreed to increase the line of credit
extended to EpicEdge, Inc. (the "Company") from $1,000,000 to $1,300,000 (the
"Bank Debt"). The closing of the Bank Debt transaction shall occur on or prior
to February 15, 2003 (the "Closing"). In the event the Company is unable to
reduce the Bank Debt to $1,000,000, by July 31, 2003, Edgewater Private Equity
Fund III, L.P. ("Edgewater") has agreed to enter into an agreement with the bank
to guarantee (the "Guarantee") the amount by which the Bank Debt exceeds
$1,000,000 on July 31, 2003, up to a maximum of $300,000 (the "Guarantee
Amount"). It is contemplated that Edgewater will enter into the guarantee
concurrently with the Closing.

      As a condition precedent to, and in consideration for, Edgewater entering
into the Guarantee, and whether or not the Guarantee is required or called upon
by the Bank, the Company agrees to issue to Edgewater a warrant to purchase a
number of shares of the Company's Series B-1 Preferred Stock having a face value
of $150,000 (the "Warrant"). The items of the Warrant shall be mutually
acceptable to Edgewater and the Company. The Company shall issue the Warrant to
Edgewater upon the execution of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock debt/equity
financing documents.

      If the foregoing satisfactorily reflects your understanding of the subject
matter contained herein, please confirm by dating and executing this letter in
the space provided below.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        Edgewater Private Equity Fund III,  L.P.
