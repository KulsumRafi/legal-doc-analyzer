         authorizations, consents and approvals and has made all necessary
         filings required under any federal, state, local or foreign law,
         regulation or rule, and has obtained all necessary authorizations,
         consents and approvals from other persons, in order to conduct its

         effect of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (u) Absence of Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the
         Prospectus, there are no actions, suits, claims, investigations or

         which could result in a judgment, decree or order having a Material
         Adverse Effect or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby.

                  (v) Financial Statements. The financial statements included or
         incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the
         Prospectus, together with the related schedules and notes, present
         fairly the consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its
         subsidiaries at the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
         operations, cash flows and changes in financial position of the
         Partnership and its subsidiaries for the periods specified; such
         financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
         during the periods involved. The supporting schedules, if any, included
         in the Registration Statement present fairly in accordance with GAAP
         the information required to be stated therein. The pro forma financial
         statements and other pro forma financial information included or

         financial statements and other pro forma financial information included
         or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
         Prospectus are reasonable and the adjustments used therein are
         appropriate to give effect to the transactions or circumstances
         referred to therein. No other financial statements or schedules of the
         Partnership are required by the Securities Act, the Rules and
         Regulations, the Exchange Act or the Exchange Act Rules and Regulations
         to be included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

                  (w) Internal Accounting Controls. Each of the TEPPCO Entities
         and their subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
         controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
         transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
         specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
         permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting



                                       12
<PAGE>

         principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to
         assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
         specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets
         is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
         appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

                  (x) No Material Adverse Change in Business. Subsequent to the
         respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration
         Statement and the Prospectus and prior to the Closing Date and except
         as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, there has not been
         and will not have been (i) any material adverse change, or any
         development which is likely to cause a material adverse change, in the
         capitalization of any of the TEPPCO Entities, or in the business,
         properties or assets described or referred to in the Registration
         Statement, or the results of operations, condition (financial or
         otherwise), business or operations of any of the TEPPCO Entities and
         their subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) any transaction which is
         material to any of the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries, except
         transactions contemplated in this Agreement or in the ordinary course
         of business, (iii) any obligation, direct or contingent, which is
         material to the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries taken as a whole,
         incurred by any of the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries, except
         obligations contemplated in this Agreement or incurred in the ordinary
         course of business, (iv) any material change in the capital stock,
         equity interests or outstanding indebtedness of any of the TEPPCO
         Entities or their subsidiaries, (v) any event that has invalidated or
         could invalidate any of the Operative Documents or (vi) any dividend or
         distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Partnership.
         None of the TEPPCO Entities nor any of their subsidiaries has any
         material contingent obligation which is not disclosed in the
         Registration Statement.

                  (y) Absence of Labor Dispute. No labor dispute with the
         employees of any of the TEPPCO Entities or any of their subsidiaries
         exists or, to the knowledge of any of the TEPPCO Entities, is imminent
         or threatened, and none of the TEPPCO Entities has any actual knowledge
         of an existing, imminent or threatened labor disturbance by the
         employees of any of its, or any of its affiliates', principal
         suppliers, manufacturers, customers or contractors, which, in either
         case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect. Each of the TEPPCO Entities and their subsidiaries is in
         compliance with all federal, state and local employment labor laws,
         including, but not limited to, laws relating to non-discrimination in
         hiring, promotion and pay of employees, except for any noncompliance
         that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                  (z) Possession of Intellectual Property. Each of the TEPPCO
         Entities and their subsidiaries own or possess, or can acquire on
         reasonable terms, adequate patents, patent rights, licenses,
         inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other
         unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information,
         systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names or other
         intellectual property (collectively, "Intellectual Property") necessary
         to carry on the business now operated by them, and none of the TEPPCO
         Entities nor any of their subsidiaries has received any notice or is
         otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights
         of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or
         circumstances which



                                       13
<PAGE>

         would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to protect
         the interest of any of the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries, and
         which infringement or conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable
         decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy, singly or in
         the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  (aa) Title to Property. Each of the TEPPCO Entities and their
         respective subsidiaries have satisfactory and marketable title to all
         properties and assets owned by such entities, in each case free and
         clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims,
         restrictions or encumbrances of any kind except such as (i) are
         described in the Prospectus or (ii) do not, singly or in the aggregate,
         materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with
         the use made and proposed to be made of such property by such entities;
         and all of the leases and subleases material to the business of such
         entities, and under which such entities hold properties described in
         the Prospectus, are in full force and effect, and none of such entities
         has any notice of any material claim of any sort that has been asserted
         by anyone adverse to the rights of such entities under any of the
         leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the
         rights of such entities to the continued possession of the leased or
         subleased premises under any such lease or sublease.

                  (bb) Investment Company Act. None of the TEPPCO Entities nor
         any of their subsidiaries is, and upon the issuance and sale of the
         Notes as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds
         therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment
         company" or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal
         underwriter" for, an "investment company" as such terms are defined in
         the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                  (cc) Public Utility Holding Company Act. None of the TEPPCO
         Entities nor any of their subsidiaries is a "holding company" as such
         term is defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
         amended ("PUHCA"); neither the TEPPCO Entities nor the issue and sale
         of the Notes by the Partnership is subject to regulation under PUHCA;
         and none of the TEPPCO Entities is a "public utility" as such term is
         defined in the Federal Power Act, as amended.

                  (dd) Environmental Laws. Each of the TEPPCO Entities and their
         subsidiaries (i) is in compliance with any and all applicable foreign,
         federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
         protection of human health and safety, the environment or imposing
         liability or standards of conduct concerning any Hazardous Material (as
         hereinafter defined) ("Environmental Laws"), (ii) has received all
         permits, licenses or other approvals required of it under Environmental
         Laws to conduct its business and (iii) is in compliance with all terms
         and conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except where
         such noncompliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required
         permits, licenses or other approvals or failure to comply with the
         terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals would not,
         individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.
         The term "Hazardous Material" means (A) any "hazardous substance" as
         defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
         Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (B) any "hazardous waste" as defined
         by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, (C) any



                                       14
<PAGE>

         petroleum or petroleum product, (D) any polychlorinated biphenyl and
         (E) any pollutant or contaminant or hazardous, dangerous, or toxic
         chemical, material, waste or substance regulated under or within the
         meaning of any other Environmental Law.

                           In the ordinary course of its business, the
         Partnership conducts a periodic review of the effect of Environmental
         Laws on the business, operations and properties of the TEPPCO Entities
         and their subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and
         evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without
         limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for
         clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws
         or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on
         operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties).
         Except as set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
         there are no costs and liabilities associated with or arising in
         connection with Environmental Laws as currently in effect (including
         without limitation, costs of compliance therewith) which would, singly
         or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ee) Insurance. Each of the TEPPCO Entities and their
         subsidiaries maintains insurance with respect to their properties and
         business of the types and in amounts generally deemed adequate for its
         business and consistent with insurance coverage maintained by similar
         companies and businesses, all of which insurance is in full force and
         effect.

                  (ff) Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the TEPPCO Entities has
         filed all federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax returns
         required by law to be filed by them and have paid all taxes,
         assessments and other governmental charges levied upon them or any of
         their properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and
         payable, other than (i) those which are not past due or are presently
         being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently
         conducted for which such reserves or other appropriate provisions, if
         any, as shall be required by generally accepted accounting principles
         have been made and (ii) with respect to state and local taxes, such as
         will not result in a Material Adverse Effect. There are no tax returns
         of any of the TEPPCO Entities that are currently being audited by
         state, local or federal taxing authorities or agencies (and with
         respect to which any of the TEPPCO Entities has received notice), where
         the findings of such audit, if adversely determined, would result in a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (gg) Benefit Plans. With respect to each employee benefit
         plan, program and arrangement (including, without limitation, any
         "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
         Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
         maintained or contributed to by any of the TEPPCO Entities, or with
         respect to which any of the TEPPCO Entities could incur any liability
         under ERISA (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"), no event has occurred
         and, to the best knowledge of each of the TEPPCO Entities or their
         subsidiaries, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in
         connection with which any of the TEPPCO Entities could be subject to
         any liability under the terms of such Benefit Plan, applicable law
         (including, without limitation, ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
         1986, as amended) or any applicable agreement that could have a
         Material Adverse Effect.



                                       15
<PAGE>

                  (hh) Absence of Notice. None of the TEPPCO Entities nor any of
         their subsidiaries have sent or received any communication regarding
         termination of, or intent not to renew, any of the contracts or
         agreements referred to or described in, or filed as an exhibit to, the
         Registration Statement or any document incorporated by reference
         therein, and no such termination or non-renewal has been threatened by
         the Partnership or, to the knowledge of the Partnership after due
         inquiry, any other party to any such contract or agreement, which
         termination or non-renewal would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ii) Validity of Data. Any statistical and market-related data
         included in the Prospectus are based on or derived from sources that
         the Partnership believes to be reliable and accurate, and the
         Partnership has obtained the written consent to the use of such data
         from such sources to the extent the General Partner believes it is
         required.

                  (jj) Violations. None of the TEPPCO Entities nor any of their
         subsidiaries, nor to the Partnership's knowledge after due inquiry, any
         employee or agent of the TEPPCO Entities, has made any payment of funds
         of the TEPPCO Entities or received or retained any funds in violation
         of any law, rule or regulation, which payment, receipt or retention of
         funds is of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration
         Statement or Prospectus.

                  (kk) Significant Subsidiaries. The subsidiaries listed on
         Schedule A attached hereto are the only significant subsidiaries of the
         Partnership as defined by Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.

                  (ll) Registration Rights. No holder of securities of the
         Partnership has rights to the registration of any securities of the
         Partnership because of the filing of the Registration Statement that
         have not been waived.

                  (mm) Officers' Certificates. Any certificate signed on behalf
         of the Partnership by the President or Vice President of the General
         Partner and on behalf of the General Partner by a President or Vice
         President thereof delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel for the
         Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by each of
         the TEPPCO Entities to each Underwriter as to the matters covered
         thereby.

                  (nn) Partnership Agreements. The Partnership Agreement is a
         valid and legally binding agreement of the General Partner, enforceable
         against the General Partner in accordance with its terms, and each of
         the Operating Partnership Agreements and Subsidiary Partnership
         Agreements is a valid and legally binding agreement of the parties
         thereto, enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its
         terms, except as the enforceability of such agreements may be affected
         by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general
         applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and general
         equitable principles.

                  (oo) Stabilization. None of the TEPPCO Entities, nor any of
         their directors, officers or controlling persons has taken, directly or
         indirectly, any action intended, or which might reasonably be expected,
         to cause or result, under the Securities Act or



                                       16
<PAGE>

         otherwise, in or which has constituted, stabilization or manipulation
         of the price of any security of the Partnership to facilitate the sale
         or resale of the Notes.

                  (pp) Disclosure. Neither this Agreement, the Registration
         Statement, nor any other document, certificate or instrument delivered
         to the Underwriters by or on behalf of the Partnership in connection
         with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, contains any
         untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
         necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
         misleading. There is no fact known to the Partnership or the General
         Partner which would result in a Material Adverse Effect or in the
         future may (so far as the Partnership can now foresee) result in a
         Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth or referred to in
         this Agreement or the Registration Statement.

                  (qq) Absence of NASD Conflict of Interest. More than ten
         percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are intended to
         be or will be paid to the Underwriters or their affiliates or members
         of the National Association of Securities Dealers or associated or
         affiliated persons of such members, or members of the immediate family
         of such members; however, the Notes are, and will continue to be
         through the Closing Date, rated at least Baa or better by Moody's
         Investors Service, Inc. or at least Bbb or better by Standard & Poor's
         Rating Services.

                  (rr) Ratings. Since the last downgrading by Moody's in May
         2002, no "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as
         that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, has
         (i) downgraded, or given notice or announcement of any intended or
         potential downgrading, or (ii) made any review or indicated any
         possible change that does not indicate an improvement in the rating
         accorded any notes of, or notes guaranteed by, the Partnership or any
         of its subsidiaries.

                  4. Certain Covenants of the Partnership and Guarantors: Each
of the Partnership and Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby agrees:

                  (a) to furnish such information as may be required and
         otherwise to cooperate in qualifying the Notes for offering and sale
         under the securities or blue sky laws of such states as you may
         designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect as long as
         required for the distribution of the Notes, provided that none of the
         Partnership or the Guarantors shall be required to qualify as a foreign
         corporation or to consent to the service of process under the laws of
         any such state (except service of process with respect to the offering
         and sale of the Notes); and to promptly advise you of the receipt by
         the Partnership or the Guarantors of any notification with respect to
         the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any
         jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
         such purpose.

                  (b) to make available to the Underwriters, without charge, as
         many copies of the Prospectus (or of the Prospectus as amended or
         supplemented if the Partnership shall have made any amendments or
         supplements thereto after the Effective Date of the Registration
         Statement) as the Underwriters may reasonably request for the purposes
         contemplated by the Securities Act; in case any Underwriter is required
         to deliver a



                                       17
<PAGE>

         prospectus within the nine-month period referred to in Section 10(a)(3)
         of the Securities Act in connection with the sale of the Notes, the
         Partnership and the Guarantors will prepare promptly upon request such
         amendment or amendments to the Registration Statement and such
         prospectuses as may be necessary to permit compliance with the
         requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

                  (c) to advise you promptly and (if requested by you) to
         confirm such advice in writing (i) when any post-effective amendment to
         the Registration Statement becomes effective and (ii) if Rule 430A
         under the Securities Act is used, when the Prospectus is filed with the
         Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (which the
         Partnership agrees to file in a timely manner under such Rules).

                  (d) to advise you promptly, confirming such advice in writing,
         of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the
         Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information with
         respect thereto, or of notice of institution of proceedings for or the
         entry of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
         Statement and, if the Commission should enter a stop order suspending
         the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, to make every
         reasonable effort to obtain the lifting or removal of such order as
         soon as possible; to advise you promptly of any proposal to amend or
         supplement the Registration Statement or Prospectus including by filing
         any documents that would be incorporated therein by reference, to
         furnish you with a draft of such proposed amendment in advance of such
         filing and to file no such amendment or supplement to which you shall
         object in writing.

                  (e) to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or
         information statement required to be filed by the Partnership or the
         Guarantors with the Commission in order to comply with the Exchange Act
         subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the
         delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or
         sale of the Notes, and to promptly notify you of such filing.

                  (f) if necessary or appropriate, to file a registration
         statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act.

                  (g) to furnish or otherwise make available to you and, upon
         request, to each of the other Underwriters for a period of three years
         from the date of this Agreement the following documents, provided such
         documents are not otherwise publicly available via EDGAR: (i) copies of
         any reports or other communications which the Partnership shall send to
         the holders of any class of its limited partnership interests or debt
         securities or shall from time to time publish or publicly disseminate,
         (ii) copies of all annual, quarterly and current reports filed with the
         Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, or such other similar form as
         may be designated by the Commission, (iii) copies of documents or
         reports filed with any national securities exchange on which any class
         of securities of the Partnership is listed, and (iv) such other
         information as you may reasonably request regarding the TEPPCO Entities
         or their subsidiaries, in each case as soon as such communications,
         documents or information become available.



                                       18
<PAGE>

                  (h) to advise the Underwriters promptly of the happening of
         any event known to the Partnership or the Guarantors within the time
         during which a Prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be
         delivered under the Securities Act which, in the judgment of the
         Partnership, would require the making of any change in the Prospectus
         then being used, or in the information incorporated therein by
         reference, so that the Prospectus would not include an untrue statement
         of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
         the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
         are made, not misleading, and, during such time, to prepare and
         furnish, at the Partnership's expense, to you promptly such amendments
         or supplements to such Prospectus as may be necessary to reflect any
         such change and to furnish to you a copy of such proposed amendment or
         supplement before filing any such amendment or supplement with the
         Commission.

                  (i) to make generally available to holders of its securities
         as soon as may be practicable but in no event later than the last day
         of the fifteenth full calendar month following the calendar quarter in
         which the Effective Date falls, and to deliver to you, an earnings
         statement of the Partnership (which will satisfy the provisions of
         Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, including Rule 158 of the Rules
         and Regulations) for a period of twelve months beginning after the
         Effective Date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c)
         of the Securities Act) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the
         termination of such twelve-month period.

         development involving a material adverse change, financial or otherwise

         representations and warranties of the Obligors and their subsidiaries
         set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of such date, that
         the Obligors and their subsidiaries shall perform such of their
         obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before
         the time of purchase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (f) and
         (g) of this Section 6 have been met and such other matters as you may
         reasonably request.

                  (i) The Partnership shall have furnished to you such other
         documents and certificates as to the accuracy and completeness of any
         statement in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as of the
         Closing Date as you may reasonably request.

                  (j) Between the time of execution of this Agreement and the
         Closing Date, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall
         any notice or announcement have been given or made of (i) any intended

         does not indicate an improvement, in the rating accorded any securities
         of, or securities guaranteed by, the Partnership or any of its
         subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
         organization," as that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the
         Securities Act.

                  (k) Since the respective dates as of which information is
         given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there shall
         have been no litigation or other proceeding instituted against any of
         the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries or any of their respective
         officers or directors in their capacities as such, before or by any
         Federal, state or local court, commission, regulatory body,
         administrative agency or other governmental body, domestic or foreign,
         in which litigation or proceeding an unfavorable ruling, decision or
         finding would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         such representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality,
         for purposes of determining whether this condition has been satisfied,
         such representation or warranty as so qualified must be true and
         correct in all respects.

<PAGE>

                  (m) The Notes shall be qualified for sale in such states as
         you may reasonably request, each such qualification shall be in effect
         and not subject to any stop order or other proceeding on the Closing
         Date.

                  7. Effective Date of Agreement; Termination. This Agreement
shall become effective when the parties hereto have executed and delivered this
Agreement.

         The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject
to termination in the absolute discretion of you or any group of Underwriters
(which may include you) which has agreed to purchase in the aggregate at least
50% of the Notes if, (x) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement
and Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change, financial or
otherwise (other than as referred to in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus as of the date hereof), in the operations, business, condition or
prospects of the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries taken as a whole, which
would, in your judgment or in the judgment of such group of Underwriters, make
it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes on the terms and in the
manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, or (y)
there shall have occurred any downgrading, or any notice shall have been given
of (i) any intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any review or possible
change that does not indicate an improvement in the rating accorded any notes
of, or notes guaranteed by, the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries by any
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined
in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act or, (z) if, at any time prior to the
Closing Date there shall have occurred: (i) a suspension or material limitation
in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, American
Stock Exchange or NASDAQ; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in
common units of the Partnership on the New York Stock Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or minimum prices shall have been
established on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the
Nasdaq National Market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking
activities declared either by the United States, Texas or New York State
authorities, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities
settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or
the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the
occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political
or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any
such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in your judgment or in the judgment
of such group of Underwriters, to make it impracticable or inadvisable to market
the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus.

         If you or any group of Underwriters elects to terminate this Agreement
as provided in this Section 7, the Partnership and each other Underwriter shall
be notified promptly by letter or telegram.

         If the sale to the Underwriters of the Notes, as contemplated by this
Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under
this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because any of the Obligors
shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Obligors
shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to
the extent provided in Sections 4(m), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters
shall be



                                       23
<PAGE>

under no obligation or liability to the TEPPCO Entities under this Agreement
(except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.

                  8. Increase in Underwriters' Commitments. Subject to Sections
6 and 7, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay
for the Notes to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a reason
sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of
Section 7 hereof) and if the aggregate principal amount of Notes which all
Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for
does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes, the
non-defaulting Underwriters shall take up and pay for (in addition to the
aggregate number of Notes they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1
hereof) the aggregate principal amount of Notes agreed to be purchased by all
such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Notes shall be taken
up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in such
amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so
designated, or in the event no such designation is made, such Notes shall be
taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion
to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the names of such
non-defaulting Underwriters in Exhibit A.

         Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations
hereunder, the Partnership agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it
will not sell any Notes hereunder unless all of the Notes are purchased by the
Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval
of the Partnership or selected by the Partnership with your approval).

         If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the
Underwriters or by the Partnership for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Partnership or you shall have
the right to postpone the Closing for a period not exceeding five business days
in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and Prospectus
and other documents may be effected.

         The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and
include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if
such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Exhibit A.

         If the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total
principal amount of Notes which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder,
and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Partnership shall make
arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase
of all the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to
purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall be terminated without further act or
deed and without any liability on the part of the Partnership to any
non-defaulting Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter to the Partnership. Nothing in this paragraph, and no
action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability
in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

                  9. Indemnification and Contribution.

                  (a) The Obligors agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify,
         defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors,
         officers, employees, agents and any person who controls any Underwriter
         within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
         the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all the foregoing
         persons from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim
         (including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of investigation,
         legal representation and other expenses incurred in connection with,
         and any and all amounts paid in settlement of, any action, suit or
         proceeding between any of the indemnified parties and any indemnifying
         parties or between any indemnified party and any third party, or
         otherwise, or any claim asserted) which, jointly or severally, any such
         Underwriter or person may incur under the Securities Act, the Exchange
         Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage,
         expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue
         statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
         the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended
         by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Partnership), in a
         Prospectus (the term "Prospectus" for the purpose of this Section 9
         being deemed to include any preliminary prospectus filed as part of the
         Registration Statement, the Prospectus (as previously defined) and the
         Prospectus as amended or supplemented by the Partnership), or in any
         documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by
         reference into the Prospectus, or in any application or other document
         executed by or on behalf of any of the TEPPCO Entities or their
         subsidiaries or based on written information furnished by or on behalf
         of any of the TEPPCO Entities or their subsidiaries filed in any
         jurisdiction in order to qualify the Notes under the securities laws
         thereof or filed with the Commission, or arises out of or is based upon
         any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to
         be stated in such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other such
         documents or necessary to make the statements made therein not
         misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability
         or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged
         untrue statement of a material fact contained in and in conformity with
         information furnished in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter
         through you to the Partnership expressly for use with reference to such
         Underwriter in such Registration Statement or such Prospectus (which
         comprises only such information referred to in the second paragraph of
         Section 3(a) of this Agreement) or arises out of or is based upon any
         omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection
         with such information required to be stated in such Registration
         Statement, Prospectus or other such documents or necessary to make such
         information not misleading. This indemnity agreement will be in
         addition to any liability that the TEPPCO Entities might otherwise
         have.

                           If any action, suit or proceeding (together, a
         "Proceeding") is brought against an Underwriter or any such person in
         respect of which indemnity may be sought against the TEPPCO Entities
         pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, such Underwriter or such person
         shall promptly notify the General Partner in writing of the institution
         of such Proceeding and the General Partner shall assume the defense of
         such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably
         satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and
         expenses, provided, however, that the omission to so notify the General
         Partner (or any omission of notice under Section 9(c)) shall not
         relieve any of



                                       25
<PAGE>

         the Obligors from any liability which any of the Obligors may have to
         any Underwriter or any such person or otherwise. Such Underwriter or
         controlling person shall have the right to employ its or their own
         counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
         shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person
         unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in
         writing by the General Partner in connection with the defense of such
         Proceeding or the Partnership shall not have, within a reasonable
         period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to have
         charge of the defense of such Proceeding or such indemnified party or
         parties shall have reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel)
         that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different
         from, additional to or in competition with those available to the
         Obligors (in which case the Obligors shall not have the right to direct
         the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or
         parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne
         by the Obligors and paid as incurred (it being understood, however,
         that the Obligors shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one
         separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one
         Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction
         representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such
         Proceeding). The Obligors shall not be liable for any settlement of any
         such claim or Proceeding effected without its written consent but if
         settled with the written consent of the General Partner and the
         Obligors agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any
         such person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
         settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an
         indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to
         reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as
         contemplated by the second sentence of this paragraph, then the
         indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of
         any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such
         settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by
         such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such
         indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in
         accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and
         (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at
         least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying
         party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
         party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in
         respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party
         and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
         party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
         indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject
         matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault,
         culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified
         party.

                  (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and
         hold harmless the Obligors, each director and officer and any person
         who controls the Obligors within the meaning of Section 15 of the
         Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors
         and assigns of all the foregoing persons from and against any loss,
         damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of
         investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Obligors or any such
         person may incur under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the common
         law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or
         claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged
         untrue statement of a material fact contained in and in conformity with
         information furnished in



                                       26
<PAGE>

         writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Obligors
         expressly for use with reference to such Underwriter in the
         Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by
         any post-effective amendment thereof by the Partnership) or in a
         Prospectus (which comprises only such information referred to in the
         second paragraph of Section 3(a) of this Agreement), or arises out of
         or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material
         fact in connection with such information required to be stated in such
         Registration Statement or such Prospectus or necessary to make such
         information not misleading. This indemnity will be in addition to any
         liability that each Underwriter might otherwise have; provided,
         however, that in no case shall any Underwriter be liable or responsible
         for any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions
         received by such Underwriter.

                           If any Proceeding is brought against any of the
         Obligors or any such person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
         against any Underwriter pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the
         Obligors or such person shall promptly notify such Underwriter in
         writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such Underwriter
         shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment
         of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and
         payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that the omission
         to so notify such Underwriter (or any omission of notice under Section
         9(c)) shall not relieve such Underwriter, from any liability which such
         Underwriter may have to the Obligors or any such person or otherwise.
         The Obligors or such person shall have the right to employ their own
         counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
         shall be at the expense of the Obligors or such person unless the
         employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by
         such Underwriter in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or
         such Underwriter shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in
         light of the circumstances, employed counsel to have charge of the
         defense of such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall
         have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or
         them which are different from or additional to or in conflict with
         those available to such Underwriter (in which case such Underwriter
         shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on
         behalf of the indemnified party or parties, but such Underwriter may
         employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and
         expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter),
         in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such
         Underwriter and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that
         such Underwriter shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one
         separate counsel in addition to any local counsel in any one Proceeding
         or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing
         the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). Anything
         in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, no Underwriter shall
         be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without
         the written consent of such Underwriter but if settled with the written
         consent of such Underwriter, such Underwriter agrees to indemnify and
         hold harmless the Obligors and any such person from and against any
         loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have
         requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for
         fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of
         this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be
         liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its
         written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60



                                       27
<PAGE>

         business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid
         request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the
         indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of
         such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the
         indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to
         settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent
         of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
         threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or
         could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder
         by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an
         unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on
         claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

                  (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is
         unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of
         this Section 9 in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities
         or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party,
         in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
         amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
         losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion
         as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
         Obligors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from
         the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
         (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
         appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in
         clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Obligors on the one
         hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
         statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages,
         expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant
         equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
         Obligors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be
         deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total proceeds
         from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but
         before deducting expenses) received by the Obligors and the
         underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.
         The relative fault of the Obligors on the one hand and of the
         Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
         other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
         of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to
         information supplied by the Obligors or by the Underwriters and the
         parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
         opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The
         amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims,
         damages and liabilities referred to in this subsection shall be deemed
         to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
         such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or
         defending any Proceeding.

                  (d) The Obligors and the Underwriters agree that it would not
         be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were
         determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were
         treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
         allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations
         referred to in subsection (c) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of
         this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any
         amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
         Notes underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public
         were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such
         Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
         statement or alleged untrue



                                       28
<PAGE>

         statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
         fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
         the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
         who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
         Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are
         several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and
         not joint.

                  (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in
         this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the
         Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and
         effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
         Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers, employees, agents or
         any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person)
         who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the
         Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of
         the Obligors, their respective directors and officers or any person who
         controls any of the Obligors within the meaning of Section 15 of the
         Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any
         termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the
         Notes. The Obligors and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each
         other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case
         of the Obligors, against any of the General Partner's officers or
         directors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, or in
         connection with the Registration Statement or Prospectus.

                  10. Notices. Except as otherwise herein provided, all
statements, requests, notices and agreements shall be in writing or by telegram

College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28288, Attn: Corporate Syndicate Desk,
Facsimile number (704) 383-9195, and, if to the Partnership, shall be sufficient

                  11. Governing Law; Construction. This Agreement and any claim,
counterclaim or dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in
any way relating to this Agreement ("Claim"), directly or indirectly, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York. The section headings in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of
convenience of reference and are not a part of this Agreement.

                  12. Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the Obligors hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any New York State Court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York or any federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York in respect of any suit, action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and irrevocably
accepts for itself (and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, its
affiliates) and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally,
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
trial by jury and any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Obligors irrevocably
consents, to the fullest



                                       29
<PAGE>

extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, to the service of process
of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
the issuer at its address set forth herein, such service to become effective 30
days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any of the
Underwriters to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any of the Obligors in
any other jurisdiction. The Obligors agree that a final judgment in any such
action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Obligors and may be enforced in any other courts in the
jurisdiction of which the Obligors are or may be subject, by suit upon such
judgment.

                  13. Parties at Interest. The Agreement herein set forth has
been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Obligors to
the extent provided in Section 9 hereof and the controlling persons, directors
and officers referred to in such section, and their respective successors,
assigns, heirs, personal representatives and executors and administrators. No
other person, partnership, association or corporation (including a purchaser, as
such purchaser, from any of the Underwriters) shall acquire or have any right
under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term "successors and assigns" as used
in this Agreement shall not include a purchaser, as such purchaser, of Notes
from the Underwriters.

                  14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed by the parties
in one or more counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement among the parties.

                  15. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon the Underwriters and the Obligors and their successors and assigns and any
successor or assign of any substantial portion of the Partnership's or
Guarantors' or any of the Underwriters' respective businesses and/or assets.

         If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding among the
Obligors and the Underwriters, please so indicate in the space provided below
for the purpose, whereupon your acceptance shall constitute a binding agreement
among the Obligors and the Underwriters, severally.

         27. The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration

Commission, appear on their face to have been appropriately responsive in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act (except as to the
financial statements and the notes thereto and schedules and other financial
data contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel
need express no opinion).

         28. None of the TEPPCO Entities nor any of their subsidiaries is or

interest in or security of the Partnership or any other person has any right to
require registration of any securities of the Partnership because of the filing
of the Registration Statement or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Underwriting Agreement.

         Such counsel shall state that although it has not undertaken, except as
otherwise indicated in such counsel's opinion, to determine independently, and
is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy,

                                  Exhibit B-6
<PAGE>

above) or any documents incorporated therein, such counsel has participated in
the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including
review and discussion of the contents thereof (including review and discussion
of the contents of all documents incorporated by reference therein) with
officers and representatives of the General Partner, representatives of the
independent public accountants of the Partnership and representatives of and
counsel for the Underwriters, and based upon this participation, no information
has come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe
that the Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated by
reference therein, but excluding the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility and
Qualification on Form T-1) at the time the Registration Statement became
effective and as of the signing of this Agreement, or the Prospectus, as of its
date and as of the date hereof, contained an untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading or that any amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus, as of its respective date, and as of the date
hereof, as the case may be, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (such counsel need not express any opinion with respect to the
financial statements and the notes thereto and the schedules and other financial
data included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any documents
incorporated by reference therein or the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility and
Qualification on Form T-1).

         In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraphs 6 through 18, terms
used therein that are defined in the UCC shall have the meanings assigned
therein. In rendering the opinion expressed in clause (A) of paragraphs 6
through 18, such counsel may rely, without investigation, upon the accuracy and
completeness of the certification from the office of the Secretary of State of
Delaware dated _____________, 2003, for each of the General Partner, TEPPCO GP,
the Partnership, TEPPCO NGL, TEPPCO Midstream, TEPPCO Crude GP, LLC, TCTM,
TEPPCO Crude Oil, L.P., TEPPCO Crude Pipeline, L.P. that there are no presently
effective financing statements, federal tax liens, or utility security
instruments filed in the office of the Delaware Secretary of State that name
such respective entities as debtor, and further, we have assumed that at all
times from and including the [INSERT DATE THROUGH WHICH EACH UCC SEARCH
CERTIFICATE CONDUCTED ITS SEARCH] and to and through the date of the delivery of
this opinion letter, there have been no filings made in the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in which the applicable entities are
named as a debtor and which covers, in whole or part, or any proceeds thereof,
any interests in the applicable entities.

         Such counsel may state that the opinions are limited exclusively to the
laws of the State of Texas, the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware LP
Act, the Delaware LLC Act, the DGCL and the federal statutory laws, rules and
regulations of the United States of America.

         Such counsel may state that, as used in its opinion, the phrase "to our
knowledge" or words of similar import means conscious awareness of facts or
other information by the lawyers in such firm who, based on its records as of
the date hereof, have devoted substantive attention to legal matters on behalf
of the TEPPCO Entities since January 1, 2001.

         In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraphs 19 and 22, such
counsel may assume that the Trustee has the power and authority to enter into
and perform its obligations under the



                                  Exhibit B-7
<PAGE>

Indenture and to authenticate and deliver the Notes, that the Indenture has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Indenture
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, enforceable
against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, that the authentication and
delivery of the Notes have been duly authorized by the Trustee and that the
Notes have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

         In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraph 22 hereof with respect
to Section 7.06 of the Indenture, such counsel need not express any opinion with
respect to the enforceability of such section should limitations on the
compensation of trustees be enacted in the future.

         In rendering the opinion expressed in paragraph 23 hereof, such counsel
may rely in substantial part, upon the following: (i) DTC will be the holder of
the Notes other than Notes issued in certificated, non-global form; (ii) DTC is
a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, and has its
place of business or chief executive office, as applicable, in the State of New
York; (iii) that the Letter of Representation between DTC, the Trustee and the
Partnership requires all payments on the Notes to be made to an account of DTC
in the State of New York; (iv) provisions of the Supplemental Indenture which
require that Notes issued in certificated, non-global form shall be payable in
the State of New York, and (v) provisions of the Supplemental Indenture that
reflect that the Trustee will conduct a substantial portion of its activities
with respect to the Notes and the Indenture in the State of New York.

         The opinions expressed herein are furnished to you for your sole
benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The
opinions expressed herein may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose
and may not be relied upon for any purpose by any other person without our prior
written consent.
