                             OTTER TAIL CORPORATION

                    DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS

                As Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2003

      1. PURPOSE. The Plan is designed to provide a method of deferring payment
to non-employee Directors of all or part of their retainer and/or meeting fees,
as fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, until termination of their
services on the Board.

      2. PLAN PERIODS. The first Plan Period shall commence upon the election of
Directors at the 1984 Annual Stockholders' Meeting and terminate on December 31,
1984. An additional Plan Period will commence on July 1, 2000 and continue
through December 31, 2000 for which a Director may elect to defer all or part of
his or her retainer and/or meeting fees for that period in the form of
restricted stock units, as provided in Section 5 hereof. Subsequent Plan Periods
shall relate to successive calendar years.

      3. ADMINISTRATION. The Plan shall be administered by a committee of the
Board of Directors designated by the Board to administer the Plan (the
"Committee"). The Committee shall be composed solely of two or more
"Non-Employee Directors," within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Committee shall have the power to
interpret the Plan and, subject to its provisions, to make all determinations
necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.

      4. PARTICIPATION.

      (a) An individual who serves as Director and is not otherwise employed by
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in
the Plan if the Director elects to have payment of his or her retainer and/or
meeting fees in respect of a Plan Period deferred as provided herein.


                                       3
<PAGE>

      (b) The election to participate shall be made by written notice on
Schedule A to the Plan filed with the Committee prior to the first day of such
Plan Period or, in the case of a Director who first becomes eligible during a
Plan Period, not later than 30 days after the Director first becomes eligible.

      (c) At the time a Director elects to participate in the Plan or when the
Director makes an election with respect to a subsequent Plan Period, the
Director may make a concurrent election on Schedule A to have an organization
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(a "Tax Exempt Organization"), receive all or part of the cash distributions of
the Director's retainer and/or meeting fees, plus accruals thereon, in
accordance with the terms of distribution specified on Schedule A (a "Charitable
Election"). At the time a Director makes a Charitable Election, the Director
shall also recommend on Schedule A a specific Tax Exempt Organization to receive
the distributions, subject to the approval of the Committee. The Committee shall
make the final determination as to the Tax Exempt Organization that will receive
the distributions and the Committee retains the authority to designate a
different Tax Exempt Organization from the one recommended by the Director.

      (d) In the case of a Director who first becomes eligible to participate
during a Plan Period, the election to participate shall apply only to
compensation subsequent to making the election. Each such election shall be
irrevocable. An election on Schedule A shall remain in effect until changed or
rescinded. Prior to the beginning of any subsequent Plan Period, a Participant
may irrevocably elect in writing, by completing a new Schedule A, to change an
earlier election with respect to such subsequent Plan Period. Such new election
shall become effective on the first business day of the Plan Period following
receipt by the Committee of the new Schedule A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Participant may elect, prior to July 1, 2000,


                                       4
<PAGE>

to convert all or part of his or her Deferred Cash Account into the Deferred
Stock Account, as such Accounts are described in Section 5 below. The number of
whole and fractional restricted stock units (computed to four decimal places)
shall be determined as of July 3, 2000 by dividing the amount of the Deferred
Cash Account to be converted by the average of the high and low sale prices of a
Common Share of Otter Tail Corporation as reported on the NASDAQ National Market
System on July 3, 2000.

      5. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS.

      (a) An account shall be established for each eligible, electing Director
(a "Participant") which shall be designated as the Participant's Deferred
Compensation Account. A Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall
include a Deferred Cash Account, a Charitable Contribution Account, and a
Deferred Stock Account, as applicable. The Deferred Cash Account means the
bookkeeping account of this Plan to which a Participant's deemed cash
allocations are credited pursuant to the Plan. A Charitable Contribution Account
means the bookkeeping account of this Plan to which a Participant's deemed cash
allocations are credited pursuant to a Participant's Charitable Election under
this Plan. The Deferred Stock Account means the bookkeeping account of this Plan
to which a Participant's deemed restricted stock unit allocations are credited
pursuant to this Plan. If a Participant elects to have payment deferred of his
or her retainer and/or meeting fees, the amount of the retainer and/or meeting
fees payable with respect to a Plan Period shall be credited, (i) in monthly
installments as of the last day of each month in the Plan Period to which such
retainer and/or meeting fees relate, for amounts credited to the Participant's
Deferred Cash Account or Charitable Contribution Account and (ii) in quarterly
installments as of the last day of each calendar quarter in the Plan Period to
which such retainer and/or meeting fees relate, for amounts credited to the
Participant's Deferred


                                       5
<PAGE>

Stock Account, subject to the provisions of Section 5(d). The Corporation shall
not be required to segregate any amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation
Accounts, which shall be established merely as an accounting convenience.
Amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Accounts shall at all times remain
solely the property of the Corporation subject to the claims of its general
creditors and available for the Corporation's use for whatever purpose desired.

      (b) The amounts credited to a Deferred Cash Account and a Charitable
Contribution Account shall, in order to alleviate the adverse effects of an
inflationary economy, accrue interest each month at an annual rate equal to the
rate charged for prime commercial loans of 90-day maturity (based on actual
numbers of days, 360 days to the year), plus 1% as of the last business day of
the month. Such interest shall be computed on the average daily balance in each
of the Deferred Cash Account and the Charitable Contribution Account during such
month and shall be credited to each such Account and compounded as of the last
day of such month. Interest shall continue to accrue and be compounded on the
unpaid balance in each of the Deferred Cash Account and the Charitable
Contribution Account until such Account is fully distributed.

      (c) The amounts credited to a Deferred Stock Account shall be credited in
the form of restricted stock units as of the last day of the calendar quarter.
The number of whole and fractional restricted stock units (computed to four
decimal places) credited to the Account shall be determined by dividing the
amount deferred to the Deferred Stock Account during the quarter by the average
of the high and low sale prices of a Common Share of Otter Tail Corporation as
reported on the NASDAQ National Market System on the last business day of the
quarter. At such times as cash dividends are declared by the Corporation on its
outstanding Common Shares, an amount shall be credited to the Participant's
Deferred Stock Account on the record date for


                                       6
<PAGE>

such dividend equal to the amount of dividends that would be paid if the
restricted stock units (including a fractional unit) were outstanding Common
Shares on such date ("Dividend Equivalents"). At the end of the calendar quarter
in which such Dividend Equivalents are credited to the Participant's Deferred
Stock Account, the Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to additional whole
and fractional restricted stock units (computed to four decimal places) in an
amount determined by dividing the amount of the Dividend Equivalents by the
average of the high and low sale prices of a Common Share of the Corporation as
reported on the NASDAQ National Market System on the last business day of the
quarter. In the event of a stock dividend or other distribution,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Common
Shares or other securities of the Corporation, issuance of warrants or other
rights to purchase Common Shares or other securities of the Corporation or other
similar corporate transaction or event that affects the Common Shares, the
Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the number of
restricted stock units credited to a Participant's Deferred Stock Account in
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant's benefits under the
Plan.

      (d) If, prior to the end of a Plan Period, a Participant becomes an
employee of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries or dies or ceases for any
reason to be a Director, or if the effective date of participation by a
Participant for any Plan Period shall be other than the first day thereof, the
Participant will be entitled to be credited with that proportion of the annual
retainer for the full Plan Period which the number of days of his or her
participation in the Plan during such Plan Period bears to the total number of
days in such Plan Period.


                                       7

      6. PAYMENT.

      (a) Following termination of a Participant's service on the Board, the
Corporation shall distribute the entire amount accumulated in the Participant's
Deferred Compensation Account in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.

      (b) By written notice on Schedule A to the Plan filed with the Committee,
a Participant may elect to have distribution of his or her Deferred Cash Account
commence either (i) within 30 days after the date the Participant ceases to be a
Director of the Corporation, (ii) 12 months after the Participant ceases to be a
Director of the Corporation, or (iii) 24 months after the Participant ceases to
be a Director of the Corporation. Any such election, or any change in such
election (by such subsequent written notice to the Committee), shall apply only
to future deferrals. In the event no election is made as to the commencement of
a distribution, such distribution shall commence within 30 days after the date
the Participant ceases to be a Director of the Corporation. The actual date that
distribution shall commence shall be a date within the appropriate period
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

      (c) By written notice on Schedule A to the Plan filed with the Committee,
a Participant may choose to receive the distribution of his or her Deferred Cash
Account in the form of (i) one lump-sum payment or (ii) monthly distributions
over a period selected by the Participant of up to 10 years. In the event a
lump-sum payment is made under the Plan, the amount then standing to the
Participant's credit in his or her Deferred Cash Account, including interest at
the rate provided in Section 5(b) to the date of distribution, shall be paid to
the Participant on the date determined under Section 6(b). In the case of a
distribution over a period of years, the Corporation shall pay to the
Participant, commencing on the date determined under Section 6(b), monthly
installments from the amount then standing to the Participant's credit in his or
her


                                       8
<PAGE>

Deferred Cash Account, including interest on the unpaid balance at the rate
provided in Section 5(b) to the date of distribution. The amount of each
installment shall be determined by dividing the then unpaid balance, plus
accrued interest, in the Participant's Deferred Cash Account by the number of
installments remaining to be paid. If a Participant does not make a choice as to
the manner of distribution of his or her Deferred Cash Account, such
distribution shall be made in the form of monthly installments paid over a
five-year period. Notwithstanding the above and subject to approval by the
Committee, a Participant may at any time request, by written notice to the
Committee, to have the monthly payments scheduled to be made to him or her
within a tax year paid to him or her in one installment within such year.

      (d) Amounts credited to a Participant's Charitable Contribution Account
that are to be distributed to a Tax Exempt Organization shall be so distributed
as a lump-sum payment within 60 days after the end of the Plan Period for which
the Charitable Election was made; provided, however, that in the event of the
death of a Participant who has made a Charitable Election, amounts credited to
the Participant's Charitable Contribution Account shall be distributed to the
Tax Exempt Organization as a lump-sum payment within 90 days after the
Participant's death.

      (e) Distributions from the Deferred Stock Account shall be in Common
Shares of the Corporation. The Common Shares available for issuance under this
Plan shall be issued under, and in accordance with the terms of, the Otter Tail
Corporation 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. Upon distribution, one Common Share shall
be issued for each restricted stock unit, except that no fractional shares shall
be issued, and the Participant shall receive a cash payment in lieu of any
fractional share. By written notice on Schedule A to the Plan filed with the
Committee, a Participant may elect to have a distribution of his or her Deferred
Stock Account commence (i) within 30 days after the date the Participant ceases
to be a Director of the Corporation, (ii) 12


                                       9
<PAGE>

months after the Participant ceases to be a Director of the Corporation or (iii)
24 months after the Participant ceases to be a Director of the Corporation. Any
such election, or any change in such election (by subsequent written notice to
the Committee), shall apply only to future deferrals. In the event no election
is made as to the commencement of the distribution, such distribution shall
commence within 30 days after the date the Participant ceases to be a Director
of the Corporation. The actual date that the distribution shall commence shall
be a date within the appropriate period determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion.

      (f) By written notice on Schedule A to the Plan filed with the Committee,
a Participant may choose to receive the distribution of his or her Deferred
Stock Account in the form of (i) one lump-sum payment or (ii) annual
distributions over a period selected by the Participant of up to 10 years. If a
Participant does not make a choice as to the manner of distribution of his or
her Deferred Stock Account, such distribution shall be made in the form of a
lump-sum payment. In the event a lump-sum payment is made under the Plan, a
certificate representing the Common Shares payable for the whole number of
restricted stock units credited to the Participant's Deferred Stock Account
shall be delivered to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary, as the
case may be, along with cash in payment of any fractional share, on the date
determined under Section 6(d). In the case of a distribution over a period of
years, the Corporation shall pay to the Participant, commencing on the date
determined under Section 6(d), annual installments from the number of restricted
stock units then credited to the Participant's Deferred Stock Account, including
additional restricted stock units credited as a result of the deemed
reinvestment of Dividend Equivalents credited to the Participant's account. The
amount of each installment shall be determined by dividing the then unpaid
balance of restricted stock units by the number of installments remaining to be
paid. A certificate representing the whole number of


                                       10
<PAGE>

Common Shares payable for such installment shall be delivered to the Participant
or the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, along with cash in payment
of any fractional share. The value of any fractional share shall be based upon
the average of the high and low sale prices of a Common Share of the Corporation
as reported on the NASDAQ National Market System on the business day preceding
the payment date. The Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case
may be, shall have no rights as a holder of Common Shares unless and until a
certificate for the shares is issued by the Corporation.

      (g) In the event of a Participant's death, the balance of a Participant's
Deferred Cash Account or Deferred Stock Account, as the case may be, shall be
distributed to the Participant's Beneficiary(ies) over a period of not more than
five years or in a lump sum, in accordance with the Participant's choice on
Schedule B to the Plan filed with the Committee. Such distribution shall
commence within 30 days after the Participant's death, on a date within such
month to be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Additional
annual payments for distributions made over a period of more than one year shall
be made on the yearly anniversaries of such date. In the event of a
Participant's death after distribution of the Deferred Cash Account or Deferred
Stock Account, as the case may be, has commenced, any choice under this Section
6(f) shall not extend time of payment of such Account beyond the time when
distribution would have been completed if the Participant had lived. A
Participant may change Beneficiary designations by filing a subsequent Schedule
B with the Committee. If a Participant does not make a choice as to the manner
of distribution of his or her Deferred Cash Account or Deferred Stock Account,
as the case may be, in the event of death, any such distribution shall be made
as a lump-sum payment to his or her estate within 30 days after the
Participant's death.


                                       11
<PAGE>

      (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee
shall determine in its sole discretion that the time of payment of a
Participant's Deferred Compensation Account should be advanced because of
protracted illness or other undue hardship, then the Committee may advance the
time or times of payment (whether before or after the Director's retirement
date) only if the Committee determines that an emergency beyond the control of
the Participant exists and which would cause such Participant severe financial
hardship if the payment of such benefits were not approved. Any such
distribution for hardship shall be limited to the amount needed to meet such
emergency. A Participant who receives a hardship distribution may not reenter
the Plan for 12 months after the date of such distribution. Any distribution for
hardship under this Section 6(h) shall commence or be made within 30 days after
the Committee determines to make such hardship distribution.

      7. ASSIGNMENT. No benefit under the Plan shall in any manner or to any
extent be assigned, alienated, or transferred by any Participant or Beneficiary
or subject to attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.

      8. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT. The Committee may terminate the Plan at any
time so that no further amounts shall be credited to Deferred Compensation
Accounts or may, from time to time, amend the Plan, without the consent of
Participants or Beneficiaries; provided, however, that no such amendment or
termination shall impair any rights which have accrued under the Plan.

                              IRREVOCABLE ELECTION

      THIS IRREVOCABLE ELECTION is being made pursuant to the Otter Tail
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, As Amended and Restated
Effective January 1, 2003 (the "Plan"). Any election under any Section specified
below which changes a prior election under the Plan shall apply only to

the meanings given to them in the Plan.

SECTION 1. DEFERRAL ELECTION.

      I hereby irrevocably elect to defer receipt of all or part of my retainer

      Subject to the Committee's approval, I hereby recommend:

as the recipient of distributions from my Charitable Contribution Account. I
certify that ______________________ qualifies as an organization described in
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. I understand

designate an alternate Tax Exempt Organization to receive the distributions.

                            my name until I receive a distribution from the Plan
                            and, until such time, my Deferred Stock Account will
                            be credited with restricted stock units and Dividend

                            Corporation

                  ______    12 months after I cease to be a Director of the
