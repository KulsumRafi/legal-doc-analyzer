    Reason following a Change in Control of the Company. This Plan replaces any
    prior severance or separation pay policies and/or practices of the Company
    with respect to employees eligible to participate in the Plan. This document
    constitutes both the written instrument under which the Plan is maintained
    and the summary plan description for the Plan.</font></p>

    to (a)&nbsp;the Company&#8217;s power to amend or terminate the Plan or (b)&nbsp;any

    Employee and the Company, which agreement must be in writing and signed by
    the Covered Employee and the Company. The Plan will automatically terminate
    on March 31, 2008 unless the Company determines otherwise; provided, however,
    if there are any outstanding Determination Period or Severance Period on March
    31, 2008, then the Plan will remain in effect until all Severance Benefits

    a written notice explaining the specific reasons for the denial and referring
    to the provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based. The notice will
    also describe any additional information needed to support the claim. The
    denial notice will be provided within 90&nbsp;days after the claim is received.
    If special circumstances require an extension of time (up to 90&nbsp;days),
    written notice of the extension will be given within the initial 90-day period.</font></p>

    the decision denying the claim. Review must be requested within 60 days following
    the date the claimant received the written notice of their claim denial or
    else the claimant loses the right to review. The claimant (or representative)
    then has the right to review pertinent documents and to submit issues and
    comments in writing. The Administrator will provide written notice of his
    or her decision on review within 60&nbsp;days after it receives a review request.
    If additional time (up to 60&nbsp;days) is needed to review the request, the
    claimant (or representative) will be given written notice of the reason for
    the delay.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="serif">20.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement
    of ERISA Rights.</b> As a Covered Employee under the Plan, you have certain
    rights and protections under ERISA:</font></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left:6%; text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">(a)<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You may
    examine (without charge) all Plan documents, including any amendments and
    copies of all documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as the
    Plan&#8217;s annual report (IRS Form 5500). These documents are available
    for your review in the Company&#8217;s Human Resources Department.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">(b)<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font><font size="2" face="serif">You
    may obtain copies of all Plan documents and other Plan information upon written
    request to the Plan Administrator. A reasonable charge may be made for such
    copies.</font></p>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">In addition to creating rights for Covered Employees,
    ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation
    of the Plan. The people who operate the Plan (called &#8220;fiduciaries&#8221;)
    have a duty to do so prudently and in the interests of you and the other Covered
    Employees. No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you
    or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining
    a benefit under the Plan or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim
    for a severance benefit is denied, in whole or in part, you must receive a
    written explanation of the reason for the denial. You have the right to have
    the denial of your claim reviewed. (The claim review procedure is explained
    in Sections&nbsp;10 and 11 above.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to
    enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request materials and do not
    receive them within 30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In
    such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials
    and to pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the
    materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan
    Administrator. If you have a claim which is denied or ignored, in whole or
    in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen
    that you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek
    assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal
    court.</font></p>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">In any case, the court will decide who will pay
    court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the
    person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may
    order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds that your
    claim is frivolous.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">If you have any questions regarding the Plan,
    please consult the Company&#8217;s Human Resources Department. If you have
    any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you may
    contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration
    (formerly the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration), U.S. Department
    of Labor, listed in your telephone director, or the Division of Technical
    Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S.
    Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20210.</font></p>
