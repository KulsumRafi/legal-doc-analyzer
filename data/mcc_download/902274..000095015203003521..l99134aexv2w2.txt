             2.3 Purchase Price.

                 (a) Amount. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees to pay or cause to be paid to
Seller an aggregate of USD $16,750,000 as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4 and
Section 2.3(d) (the "Purchase Price") and to assume the Assumed Liabilities as
provided in Section 3.1 (the sum of the Purchase Price and the amount of the
Assumed Liabilities constituting the "Total Purchase Price").

                 (b) Payment. Subject to the closing adjustments provided for in
Section 2.3(d) and the post-closing adjustment provided for in Section 2.4
below, if any, the Purchase Price shall be payable as follows:

                 (i) At Closing, Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Liabilities
as provided in Section 3.1 below by executing the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement; and

                  (ii) At Closing, Purchaser shall pay the amount set forth in
Section 2.3(a) above by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
"qualified intermediary" (as defined in the Code) designated by Seller.

                 (c) Allocation. Within 45 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare an allocation of the Total Purchase Price (as required
pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets and the
Covenant Not Compete set forth in Section 7.7 of this Agreement (the "Purchase
Price Allocation"). Purchaser and Seller (and their Affiliates) shall then
cooperate in good faith to revise and finalize the Purchase Price Allocation. If
Purchaser and Seller (and their Affiliates) are unable to agree on the Purchase
Price Allocation within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and
Seller will select an appraisal firm (the "Arbitrating Appraiser") mutually
acceptable to them to resolve any remaining disagreements regarding the Purchase
Price Allocation. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the choice of
the Arbitrating Appraiser, they will select a nationally recognized appraisal
firm by lot (after excluding any such firm engaged by Purchaser, Seller or their
Affiliates) to be the Arbitrating Appraiser. The cost of any such Arbitrating
Appraiser shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. The Purchaser and
Seller shall be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation determined by the
Arbitrating Appraiser. Purchaser and Seller (and their Affiliates) shall file
all Tax Returns consistently with the Purchase Price Allocation and shall not
voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax
Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise with respect to
such Tax Returns, unless required to pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar foreign, state or local Tax
provision).

                 (d) Property Taxes. General real estate, personal property and
any other property taxes related to the Purchased Assets (the "Property Taxes")
shall be prorated as of the start of the Closing Date. In the event tax bills
for the Property Tax year in which the Closing occurs are not available at
Closing, such proration shall be based upon the tax bills for the Property Tax
year immediately preceding the Property Tax year in which the Closing occurs,
and Seller's proportionate share thereof shall be subtracted from the payment
specified in Section 2.3(b)(ii) above (the credit for such proportionate share
being the "Prorated Property Taxes").

                 (e) Like-Kind Exchange. Seller desires to structure the
transaction so as to qualify as a tax-deferred exchange pursuant to Section 1031
of the Code. Purchaser shall reasonably assist and cooperate in such exchange,
at no additional cost or expense to Purchaser, and shall execute such documents
as are reasonably necessary in connection with such exchange (subject to
reasonable approval of Purchaser's counsel). Seller may assign its rights
hereunder to a "qualified intermediary" as defined in the Code. As part of such
exchange, Purchaser shall not be required to acquire or convey any property or
assets other than the consideration being paid herein.

             2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment.

                 (a) As of and promptly after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall:

                     (i) prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller
an unaudited closing balance sheet for the Acquired Business setting forth the
net book value of the Purchased Assets and book amount of the Assumed
Liabilities as of the Closing Date (such balance sheet is referred to herein as
the "Closing Balance Sheet"); and

                     (ii) from the Closing Balance Sheet, determine the amount
of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital").

                 (b) The Closing Balance Sheet shall be made and prepared in
accordance with GAAP and consistent with the accounting principles and practices
applied in preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Working Capital will be determined in accordance with the methodologies
set forth on Schedule 2.4(b) hereof (the "Working Capital Methodologies"). The
Closing Balance Sheet and the determination of the Closing Working Capital shall
be completed by Purchaser and delivered to Seller within 60 days after the
Closing Date.

                 (c) In the event Seller does not agree as to the Closing
Balance Sheet or to the amount of the Closing Working Capital determined by
Purchaser, then Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement describing
with reasonable detail the basis for any such claim within 30 days after
receiving the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Statement of Objection"). Purchaser
and Seller will use reasonable efforts to resolve any such claims themselves. If
they do not obtain a final resolution within 120 days after the Closing Date,
however, Purchaser and Seller will select an accounting firm from among the
"Final Four" accounting firms mutually acceptable to them to resolve any
remaining such claims. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the choice
of an accounting firm, they will select a nationally recognized accounting firm
by lot (after excluding any such firm engaged by Purchaser, Seller or their
Affiliates) (the "Arbitrating Accountant").

                 (d) Within ten (10) calendar days after the engagement of the
Arbitrating Accountant, Seller and Purchaser shall provide the Arbitrating
Accountant with copies of (i) this Agreement, (ii) Closing Balance Sheet
prepared by Purchaser, (iii) the Purchaser's calculation of Closing Working
Capital, (iv) the Statement of Objections, (v) a list of items remaining in
dispute, and (vi) a written submission from each of Seller and Purchaser setting
forth their respective positions with respect to each item remaining in dispute.

(i) reviewing the items placed in dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(d) above, (ii)
reviewing the written submissions provided by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.4(d) above, (iii) determining the appropriate and correct amounts for
any item in dispute in the Closing Working Capital in accordance with Section
2.4(a) and (b) hereof; provided, that in resolving a disputed item, the
Arbitrating Accountant may not assign a value of any particular item greater
than the greatest value of such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as presented
to the Arbitrating Accountant and (iv) determining the correct Closing Working
Capital amount. The Arbitrating Accountant shall make a written determination on
each disputed matter no later than 180 days after the Closing Date and such
determination will be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and the Seller with
respect to that disputed matter. The proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital will be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution
of any such claims pursuant to this Section 2.4.

                 (f) The fees, charges and expenses of the Arbitrating
Accountant (collectively, the "Accounting Expenses") shall be borne by the
parties hereto in the following manner: (A) if the difference between the
Closing Working Capital determined by Purchaser and the Closing Working Capital
determined by the Arbitrating Accountant is greater than the difference between
the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Statement of Objections by Seller
and the Closing Working Capital determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, the
Purchaser will pay all of the Accounting Expenses; (B) if the difference between
Closing Working Capital determined by Purchaser and the Closing Working Capital
determined by the Arbitrating Accountant is less than the difference between the
Closing Working Capital set forth in the Statement of Objections by Seller and
the Closing Working Capital determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, then
Seller will pay all of the Accounting Expenses and (C) if the difference between
Closing Working Capital determined by Purchaser and the Closing Working Capital
determined by the Arbitrating Accountant is equal to the difference between the
Closing Working Capital set forth in the Statement of Objections by Seller and
the Closing Working Capital determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, then
Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of the Accounting Expenses.

                 (g) Purchaser will make the work papers and back-up materials
necessary for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, and any books,
records and financial staff of the Acquired Business, available to Seller and
its accountants and other representatives and to the Arbitrating Accountant
resolving any claim concerning the Closing Balance Sheet at reasonable times and
upon reasonable notice at any time during (i) the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet, (ii) the review by Seller of the Closing Balance Sheet, and (iii)
the resolution by Purchaser and Seller and/or the Arbitrating Accountant of any
objections thereto.

                 (h) Seller will make the work papers and back-up materials
necessary for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet available to
Purchaser and its accountants and other representatives and to the Arbitrating
Accountant resolving any claim concerning the Closing Balance Sheet at

Working Capital as finally determined under this Section 2.4 is greater than
$3,250,617 or less than $2,659,595. If the Closing Working Capital is greater
than $3,250,617, then the Purchase Price will be increased accordingly on a
dollar-for-dollar basis of the amount of such excess (the "Positive Closing Date
Adjustment Amount"). In such event, the Positive Closing Date Adjustment Amount
will be paid by Purchaser to Seller together with interest for the period from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at the rate of 2% per annum, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller in
writing, no later than three business days after the completion of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the resolution of any disputes related thereto pursuant to
Section 2.4 of this Agreement. If the Closing Working Capital is less than
$2,659,595, then the Purchase Price will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis of the amount of such deficiency (the "Negative Closing Date Adjustment
Amount"). In such event, Seller will pay the Negative Closing Date Adjustment
Amount to Purchaser together with interest for the period from the Closing Date
to the date of payment at the rate of 2% per annum, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser in writing, no
later than three business days after the completion of the Closing Balance Sheet

                 (a) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date (the

Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, shall notify Seller in writing within
five (5) business days after receipt of such Participation Cost Notice of such
fact and of its agreement to pay the Participation Costs as set forth in the
applicable Participation Costs Notice. Purchaser, or its designated Affiliates,
shall pay such Participation Costs (i) to the extent practicable, before they
are incurred by Seller or Seller's Affiliate or, if not practicable, reimburse

New Resin Contact.

Purchaser or its designated Affiliate is unable to participate in a buying group
for resin or is unable to be a party to a New Resin Contract, or (ii) Seller is,
or its Affiliates are, prohibited from including, or unable to include,
Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, as a participant in a buying group for
resin, or as a party to any New Resin Contract for purposes of satisfying the
Acquired Business's resin supply needs, Seller agrees to use its best efforts to
sell to Purchaser, or any designated Affiliate of Purchaser, solely for the
benefit of the Acquired Business, (x) resin of the type purchased by the

to manufacture or produce any of the products manufactured as of the date hereof
by the Acquired Business which are set forth in the 2002 Traex Product Guide any
time during the Resin Supply Period, which resin can be available under a then
existing New Resin Contract. Such resin shall be resold to Purchaser, or its
designated Affiliate, at the same price and pursuant to the same terms that
Seller or its Affiliates may purchase the resin from the resin supplier under
the applicable New Resin Contract; provided, that, such resin shall be sold by
Seller or its Affiliates to Purchaser or its Affiliates on an AS-IS basis except
that Seller and its Affiliates shall pass along any warranty provided by the
resin supplier with respect to any resin purchased by Purchaser or its
Affiliates; provided, further that Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, shall
receive its pro-rata share of all discounts, rebates or other economic benefits
under each of the New Resin Contracts its buys any resin from Seller under, with
such discounts applied, and such rebates paid, in accordance with applicable
terms and conditions of each New Resin Contract, as if Purchaser, or its
designated Affiliate, were a party to such New Resin Contract. Seller and its
Affiliates shall, at Purchaser's cost, provide such assistance to Purchaser or
its Affiliates in asserting any breach of warranty or other similar claim
against a resin supplier as Purchaser may reasonably request.

resin from Seller or its Affiliate pursuant to subsection (b) above, during the
Resin Supply Period, Purchaser, or a designated Affiliate of Purchaser, may
(solely for the benefit of the Acquired Business) from time to time issue
purchase orders to Seller for the purchase of resin to be supplied pursuant to
subsection (b) above under the applicable New Resin Contracts ("Purchase
Order"), it being agreed to that notwithstanding the terms and conditions of
such Purchase Order, the terms of this Section 7.3 shall govern. Each such
Purchase Order for resin shall not become an effective order for the purchase of
resin until Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, shall have received a
Participation Costs Notice from Seller and thereafter confirms in writing to
Seller that it intends to purchase the resin under such Purchase Order and pay
any Participation Costs in connection therewith. To the extent that Seller or
its Affiliates will incur any Participation Costs in connection with Seller's
resale of resin to Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, Seller shall, within
ten (10) business days of receipt of such Purchase Order for resin, provide
Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, with a Participation Costs Notice. If,
upon receipt of the Participation Costs Notice, Purchaser, or its designated
Affiliate, agrees to purchase the resin from Seller under such applicable
Purchase Order, Purchaser, or its designated Affiliate, shall notify Seller in
writing confirming its previous Purchase Order (the "PO Confirmation") and its
agreement to reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for the Participation Costs set
forth in the Participation Costs Notice within five (5) business days after
receipt thereof. Purchaser, or its designated Affiliates, shall reimburse Seller
or its Affiliates for such enumerated Participation Costs within ten (10)
business days of receipt of the PO Confirmation.

                 (d) For the purpose of this Section 7.3, (i) "New Resin
Contract" shall mean any contract, agreement or arrangement regarding the supply
of resin (including, without limitation, resin colorants) to the Seller or any
of its Affiliates from resin suppliers during the Resin Supply Period and (ii)
"Participation Costs" shall mean any costs, fees or other expenses (including
without limitation any increase in resin prices) which a resin supplier imposes
on Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser participating in any buying group, becoming a party to
any New Resin Contract or purchasing resin from Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, as the case may be, including any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser participating in any buying group,
becoming a party to a New Resin Contract or purchasing resin from Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be.

                 (e) For purposes of notice under this Section 7.3, Seller and
Purchaser shall notify each other within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date of
the person and coordinates of the person who shall receive all notices under
this Section 7.3 (each the "Notice Person"). Any time thereafter, each party may
notify the other in writing of any change in the applicable party's Notice
Person. Any notices or other communications required or permitted under this
Section 7.3 shall be in writing and shall be considered delivered in all
respects when delivered by hand or by facsimile transmission (but only if
followed by transmittal by national overnight courier or hand delivery on the
next business day) or on receipt after dispatch by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid or on the next business day if transmitted by national overnight
courier to the applicable Notice Person.

             7.4 Books and Records. As soon as reasonably practical after the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser all of
the Books and Records in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates; provided,
however, that Purchaser recognizes that certain Books and Records may be part of
other books and records of Seller which are not part of the Purchased Assets;
provided, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to separate or extricate the
Books and Records from the data and materials which are not part of the
Purchased Assets and provide Purchaser with such Books and Records in usable
electronic or hard copy form.

             7.5 Corporate Name. To the extent the trademarks, service marks,
brand names, logos or trade, corporate or business names of Seller or of any of
Seller's Affiliates ("Seller IP") are not included in the Purchased Assets but
are used by the Acquired Business on existing supplies of packaging or printed
advertising and promotional materials, catalogs, inventories or like materials
(collectively, the "Packaging") included in the Purchased Assets, Purchaser and
the Acquired Business may use such Packaging or sell such inventories after the
Closing Date (without altering or modifying such Packaging and Inventories)
until such Packaging is exhausted and in any event no later than December 31,
2003. Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, hereby grant to Purchaser a
royalty free, non-exclusive and nontransferable license to use Seller IP as it
exists on such Packaging in the ordinary course of business until December 31,
2003.

             7.6 Use of Business Name. After the Closing, Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly, use or do business, or allow any Affiliate to use or do
business, or assist any third party in using or doing business, under the name
and mark "Traex" (or any other name confusingly similar to such names and
marks).

             7.7 Covenant Not to Compete; Non-Solicitation.

                 (a) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing
Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), Seller and Seller's Affiliates shall not, and
Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage,

Competing Business anywhere in the world, whether as a manufacturer,
distributor, reseller, partner, stockholder, equity holder, member, sole
proprietor, contractor, owner, consultant or otherwise except with respect to
the services to be provided to the Acquired Business and Purchaser pursuant to
the Transition Agreement or as permitted below.

                 (b) Except for the persons listed in Section 4.25 of the
Disclosure Schedule, for a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing
Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly solicit or seek to induce any of the employees of
the Acquired Business on or after the Closing Date to leave their employment or
positions with the Acquired Business or Purchaser, provided, however, that
"solicit or seek to induce" shall not include, and none of Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall be prohibited from (i) advertising employment opportunities in
any national newspaper, trade journal or other publication in a major
metropolitan area, e.g. Milwaukee, Wisconsin and (ii) participating in any third
party hiring fair or similar event open to the public or negotiating with,

<PAGE>

responsible for any violation of this covenant by any of its Affiliates,
employees, agents or representatives.

                 (c) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7
shall restrict or prohibit:

                     (i) Seller from continuing to manufacture, distribute,
service, sell or market (x) any products currently produced by Seller or any
current Affiliate of Seller and (y) any other products which are comparable
items which are typically manufactured or sold by Seller or its current
Affiliates, other than those products which are currently produced by the
Acquired Business itself;

                     (ii) Seller from owning less than 5% of the stock of a
publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities
exchange or listed with the Nasdaq Stock Market; or

                     (iii) Seller acquiring a business which derives less than
$5 million of its gross revenues (as determined based on such business's most
recently completed fiscal year) from the sale of Acquired Business Products.

                 (d) As used in this Section 7.7, (i) "Competing Business" shall
mean the design, development, manufacture, distribution, servicing, sale or
marketing of the Acquired Business Products; (ii) "Acquired Business Products"
shall mean: (x) plastic and metal products and articles used for (1) the
dispensing to the end user consumer of paper, tissue, napkins, straws,
toothpicks, beverage containers and lids; or (2) tabletop items used or consumed
by patrons of bars, hotels, restaurants and similar eating and drinking

                 (e) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 7.7 is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination
of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment may be appealed.

                 (f) Seller agrees that the Acquired Business and Purchaser and
its Affiliates may suffer irreparable harm from a breach of any of the covenants
and/or agreements contained in this Section 7.7. In the event of an alleged or
threatened breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any of the provisions of
this Section 7.7, the Acquired Business or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
successors and assigns may, in addition to all other rights and remedies




                                       35
<PAGE>

existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or
prevent any violations of the provisions hereof (including the extension of the
Non-Compete Period by a period equal to the length of the violation of this
Section 7.7), without the Purchaser or any of its affiliates being obligated to
post any bond or other security. In the event an alleged breach or violation by
Seller or any of its Affiliates of any of the provisions of this Section 7.7,
the Non-Compete Period shall be tolled for the period of the violation by Seller
or its Affiliates if such alleged breach or violation is resolved against Seller
or its Affiliates.

                 (g) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants in this
Section 7.7 are intended to benefit Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Acquired
Business, and their respective successors and assigns from and after the
Closing, but, in the event an Affiliate of Seller is acquired by a third party
which is not an Affiliate of Seller and will not be an Affiliate of Seller, such
covenants shall not be binding upon such Affiliate or the acquiror of such
Affiliate.

             7.8 Assistance for Certain Consents.

                 (a) To the extent that any of the Purchased Assets are not
capable of being assigned or transferred without the Consent of the other party
thereto or any third party, or if such assignment or attempted assignment or
transfer would constitute a breach thereof or a violation of any Law, decree,
order, other governmental edict, this Agreement shall not constitute an
assignment or transfer thereof, or an attempted assignment or transfer of any
such Purchased Assets until properly transferred.

                 (b) If any of the Purchased Assets are not assigned to
Purchaser upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
due to circumstances described in Section 7.8(a) above, then Purchaser shall not
assume any liabilities or obligations related to or arising out of such
non-transferred Purchased Assets until such Purchased Assets can be properly
transferred to Purchaser; provided, however, if Seller provides Purchaser with,
or Purchaser receives, the benefits of such non-transferred Purchased Asset in
accordance with Section 7.8(c) below, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for all
corresponding payments due under such non-transferred Purchased Asset during the
time such benefits are provided to Purchaser.

                 (c) The Seller is not obligated to transfer to the Purchaser
any of its rights and obligations in and to any of the Purchased Assets without
first having obtained all necessary Consents, including the Required Consents,
unless Purchaser otherwise notifies Seller in writing prior to Closing that such
assets should be assigned to Purchaser. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall have used its reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consents without
conditions or requirements that are materially adverse to the Purchaser. To the
extent that the Consents necessary to properly assign, transfer or sublicense
any of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser are not obtained prior to Closing,
Seller shall, commencing on the Closing Date, and continuing for the duration of
each such Purchased Asset, or such shorter period if Purchaser notifies Seller
that it no longer desires such Purchased Asset, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) provide to Purchaser and the Acquired Business the benefits of
any such Purchased Asset not assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed due
to Seller's failure or inability to obtain such Consent during such period and
(ii) aid Purchaser and the Acquired Business in



                                       36
<PAGE>

obtaining any Consents required for the proper transfer of such Purchased Assets
to the Purchaser. With respect to the Required Software Agreements, Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts to replace the services or software
provided under such agreements in the event it becomes evident to Purchaser that
Purchaser will not be able to obtain the required Consent necessary for proper
transfer of the applicable Required Software Agreement.

         8.  COVENANTS OF PURCHASER.

             8.1 Further Acts. On the Closing Date, or thereafter if necessary,
Purchaser shall, without cost or expense to Seller, execute and deliver to or
cause to be executed and delivered to Seller such further documents and take
such other action as Seller may reasonably require to carry out more effectively
and completely the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             8.2 Product Matters. Purchaser shall, at Seller's cost, provide
such assistance as Seller may reasonably request, including without limitation,
providing replacement products, in connection with any product warranty, product
liability or similar claim relating to products of the Acquired Business sold
prior to Closing.


         9.  MUTUAL COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES.

             9.1 Publicity. No public announcement or other publicity regarding
the transactions referred to herein shall be made by any party hereto without
the prior written approval of all parties hereto as to form, timing and manner
of distribution or publication, except to the extent otherwise required by any
applicable Law, including any securities Laws, or on advice of counsel. A party
required to make a public announcement regarding the transactions described
herein shall use reasonable efforts to provide the other party with advance
notice of the timing and contents of such announcement.

             9.2 Further Actions Regarding Transferred Assets.

                 (a) To the extent that time does not permit proper recordation
of such assignments contemplated by this Agreement (other than as to real
property), as for example in the case of certain assignments of Intellectual
Property, Seller shall cause the assignment of beneficial title therein to be
effected as of the Closing and, subsequent to the Closing, will at no cost to
Seller provide all assistance and cooperation as is reasonably necessary to
effectuate recordable assignment of such assets.

                 (b) Until March 31, 2004, if it is discovered by either of the
parties hereto that certain assets and properties of the Acquired Business were
not properly included in the Purchased Assets and assigned to Purchaser, Seller
shall promptly take all actions necessary to effect the proper assignment and
transfer of all right, title and interest in all such assets and properties to
Purchaser, as designated by Purchaser.

                 (c) Until March 31, 2004, if it is discovered by either of the
parties hereto that (i) any Seller Retained Asset was improperly assigned to
Purchaser or (ii) any Assumed Liability was not properly assumed by Purchaser
prior to the Closing which was



                                       37
<PAGE>

required to be assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and was not
properly assumed by the Purchaser at the Closing, Purchaser shall, and Purchaser
shall take all actions necessary to effect the assignment back to Seller of such
Seller Retained Assets, or the assumption by Purchaser of such Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be.

             9.3 Access to Information.

                 (a) Seller will grant to Purchaser access to any relevant
records related to operation of the Acquired Business that is reasonably
required by Purchaser and not transferred hereunder. Purchaser will grant to
Seller access to any relevant records related to the Acquired Business that is
reasonably required by Seller and transferred hereunder. Any such access shall
be during normal business hours where such data and records are regularly
maintained. However, such access to records shall be granted solely be for a
proper business purpose (e.g., litigation not covered by Article 10 hereof,
preparation of Tax Returns). To the extent such request for records relates to
any matter subject to Articles 10 hereof, then access to records shall be
governed by Section 10.4(e) hereof and not this Section 9.3(a). To the extent
any information provided to Purchaser hereunder does not relate to the Acquired
Business, Purchaser shall keep such information confidential. To the extent any
information provided by Purchaser to Seller is deemed confidential information
to the Acquired Business or the Purchaser by the Purchaser, Seller shall agree
to keep such information confidential, unless such information is required to be
disclose in connection with litigation or any filing with a Governmental
Authority.

                 (b) After the Closing Date, Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser, and Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, in the preparation of all
Tax Returns and will provide (or cause to be provided) any records and other
information the other so reasonably requests (including, without limitation,
information necessary to calculate the research tax credit pursuant to Section
41 of the Code (and any similar state, local or foreign tax provision) with
respect to the Acquired Business), and will provide reasonable access to, and
the reasonable cooperation of its employees and auditors. Seller will cooperate
in all reasonable respects with Purchaser and Purchaser will cooperate in all
reasonable respects with Seller in connection with any Tax investigation, audit
or other proceeding.

             9.4 Employees.

                 (a) Except for those Business Employees set forth on Schedule
9.4(a)(i), Purchaser shall make offers of employment to all active Business
Employees, effective as of the Closing Date. For this purpose a Business
Employee shall be an "active" Business Employee if such employee is actively at
work on the Closing Date, or is absent from work on the Closing Date due to
holiday, vacation, jury duty or sick leave (provided such sick leave is not
reasonably likely to result in such Business Employee becoming entitled to
disability benefits under Seller's long term disability plan). Purchaser's offer
of employment shall be at the same wage and salary rate of compensation as such
individual received from Seller, and pursuant to the benefit plans as summarized
on Schedule 9.4(a)(ii). Each Business Employee who accepts Purchaser's offer of
employment and becomes an employee of Purchaser on the Closing Date shall be
referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." Purchaser shall provide to the
Transferred Employees severance benefits under the terms of Purchaser's
severance plan;



                                       38
<PAGE>

provided that if the Transferred Employees set forth on Schedule 9.4(a)(iii)
otherwise become entitled to severance benefits under the terms of Purchaser's
severance plan between the Closing and December 31, 2003, the amount of and form
of severance benefits shall be as set forth on Schedule 9.4(a)(iii) (the
"Special Severance"). Prior to Closing, Seller shall inform the Transferred
Employees set forth on Schedule 9.4(a)(iii) of the Special Severance
arrangement. In the event Purchaser becomes obligated to provide Special
Severance to any of the Transferred Employees set forth on Schedule 9.4(a)(iii)
during the 120 days following Closing, then Seller shall reimburse Purchaser
within 10 business days of receipt of an invoice for the amount of such
severance, including the cost of the continued employee benefits; provided,
however, that the amount of the salary continuation component of such severance
reimbursement obligation shall not exceed the amount determined based on the
Transferred Employee's salary rate as in effect at the time of the Closing,
without regard to any increase following the Closing. Purchaser shall credit
each Transferred Employee with years of service with Seller and Traex (and any
predecessor thereof) for purposes of eligibility, and vesting under each
employee benefit program Purchaser maintains for Transferred Employees, and for
determining levels of benefits under Purchaser's severance, vacation and other
paid-time off programs, but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit or cash balance pension plan. It is specifically understood and agreed
that Purchaser shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion to
terminate or layoff any Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date.

                 (b) Purchaser agrees to establish flexible spending account
arrangements for Transferred Employees identical to those maintained by Seller
with respect to such Transferred Employees with initial account balances equal
to the account balances of such Transferred Employees under Seller's flexible
spending arrangements immediately prior to Closing. Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller from contributions received from Transferred Employees for any negative
balances under Seller's flexible spending arrangement as of the Closing Date.
Seller shall transfer to Purchaser all positive balances under Seller's flexible
spending arrangement.

                 (c) Except to the extent included in the Assumed Liabilities or
as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4, Seller shall retain all liability for
the Existing Plans.

                 (d) Purchaser shall establish, effective as of the Closing
Date, a group health plan containing the features set forth on Schedule
9.4(a)(ii) in which Transferred Employees and their qualifying dependents who
are covered under Seller's group health plan on the Closing Date shall be
eligible to participate effective on the day immediately following the Closing
Date.

                 (e) Seller shall fully vest all Business Employees in their
account balances under the Existing Plan which is a 401(k) plan (the "Seller's
401(k) Plan") on the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Seller shall spin-off and transfer the account balances of each
Transferred Employee who is a participant in Seller's 401(k) plan to a 401(k)
plan maintained by Purchaser (the "New 401(k) Plan") in cash pursuant to a
trustee to trustee transfer in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code. The
transfer of the account balance liability and related assets shall include a
trustee-to-trustee transfer of all participant loan accounts and liabilities
under Seller's 401(k) Plan.



                                       39
<PAGE>

                 (f) To the extent accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet,
Purchaser shall assume the liability with respect to all accrued and unpaid
vacation and other paid time off with respect to Transferred Employees.

                 (g) (i) Seller and Purchaser shall adopt the alternative
procedure of Rev. Proc. 96-60 for purposes of filing IRS Forms W-4 (Employee's
Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance Payment
Certificate). Under this procedure Seller shall provide to Purchaser all IRS
Forms W-4 and W-5 on file with respect to each Transferred Employee, and
Purchaser will honor these forms until such time, if any, that such Transferred
Employee submits a revised form.

                 (ii) With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support
orders, and wage assignments in effect with Seller on the Closing Date for
Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall honor such payroll deduction
authorizations with respect to Transferred Employees and will continue to make
payroll deductions and payments to the authorized payee, as specified by the
court or governmental order which was filed with Seller on or before the Closing
Date, and Seller will continue to make such payroll deductions and payments to
authorized payees with respect to all other Business Employees. Seller shall, as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, provide Purchaser with such
information in the possession of Seller as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser and necessary for Purchaser to make the payroll deductions and
payments to the authorized payee as required by this subsection (ii).

                 (h) Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in providing such
employee records, data and information necessary in order for Purchaser to
perform its obligations and responsibilities under this Section 9.4.

                 (i) No provision of this Section 9.4 shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights in any Business Employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with the Purchaser and no provision
of this Section 9.4 shall create any such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Existing
Plans or any such similar plan or arrangement which may be established by the
Purchaser for Transferred Employees.

period set forth above, Purchaser's right to indemnification and Seller's
obligation to indemnify such Claim under any such Sections shall survive with
respect to such Claim until such time as such Claim is finally resolved. It is
further understood and agreed, that notwithstanding the termination of any
indemnification obligations under Section 10.3(j) in accordance with this
Section 10.1(b), Purchaser shall, from and after the Closing be entitled to
avail itself of all remedies available under Law or equity, including without
limitation, the right to seek contribution, injunctive relief or specific
performance, as it relates to any Claims that relate to, arise out of or result
from matters covered under Section 10.3(j).

             10.4 Indemnification Process. The Person making a claim for
indemnification under this Section 10 shall be, for the purposes of this
Agreement, referred to as the "Indemnified Party" (provided that for the purpose
of clause (c) below such term shall refer to the party hereto to whom such
Person is related for purposes of obtaining the benefits of this Section 10) and
the party or parties against whom such claims are asserted under this Section 10
shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement, referred to as the "Indemnifying
Party." All claims by any Indemnified Party under this Section 10 shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

                 (a) Notice of Claims. In the event that (i) any claim, action,
suit, arbitration, hearing or proceeding is asserted or instituted against any
Indemnified Party by any Person other than the parties to this Agreement or
their Affiliates which could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying
Party could be liable to an Indemnified Party for Damages under this Agreement
(such claim, demand or Proceeding, a "Third Party Claim") or (ii) any
Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified for
Damages by any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a
Third Party Claim (such claim, a "Direct Claim" and, together with Third Party
Claims, "Claims"), the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness and in
any event within 10 business days of becoming aware of such Claim send to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying in reasonably detail the nature
of such Claim, the amount of Damages sought in such Claim, if known, and the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises (a "Claim Notice"), provided that a delay or defect in
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that (and only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or
defect.

                 (b) Third Party Claims. In the event of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to appoint counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party and
any others the Indemnifying Party may reasonably designate in connection with
such Third Party Claim (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not
thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by any Indemnified Party except as set forth below); provided that such
counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding an Indemnifying Party's
election to appoint separate counsel to represent an Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ one separate counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary), and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
one separate counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary) if (i) there exists
a conflict of interest (including the availability of one or more legal defenses
to the Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party) that
would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party
for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party and such counsel shall
contest such Third Party Claim in good faith or (ii) if the Claim seeks
injunctive relief which, if granted could materially and adversely affect the




                                       44
<PAGE>

Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records, materials, and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating
thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. In the event
the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice thereof in accordance with the
terms hereof, (i) the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has
been asserted shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of, at the expense of and for the
account and risk of the Indemnifying Party using one counsel, plus one local
counsel, if necessary, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, all witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as
may be reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party.

                 (c) Settlement of Third Party Claims. In connection with the
settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (i) settle or compromise any Third
Party Claims or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim of all Indemnified Parties affected by such Third Party Claim
or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the settlement or
compromise imposes equitable remedies or material obligations on the Indemnified
Party other than financial obligations for which such Indemnified Party will be
indemnified hereunder or (iii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the
Indemnified Party will be required to make any payment with respect to such
compromise or settlement due to the application of the limitations of Section
10.5. No Third Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the
Indemnifying Party or which is being defended by the Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be settled or compromised by
the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided,
however, if a Third Party Claim is being defended by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to the last sentence of clause (b) above (unless the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party mutually agree that the Indemnified Party shall defend
such Third Party Claim), the limitations on the Indemnified Party's right to
settle or compromise set forth in this clause (c) shall not apply to such
Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party has been advancing (in a timely
manner) payment of such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses associated with
such defense (subject to the undertaking of the Indemnified Party to reimburse
such advances in the event such costs of defense are not ultimately to be
indemnifiable under this Section 10).

                 (d) Reduction of Damages.

                     (i) To the extent any Damages of an Indemnified Party are
reduced by receipt of payment under insurance policies, which payments are not
subject to retroactive adjustment or other reimbursement to the insurer in
respect of such payment, such payments (net of the expenses of the recovery
thereof) (such net payment, a "Reimbursement") shall be credited against any
such Damages; provided, however, the pendency of such payments



                                       45
<PAGE>

shall not delay or reduce the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to make
payment to the Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages. If any
Reimbursement is obtained subsequent to payment by an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Damages, such Reimbursement shall be promptly paid over to the
Indemnifying Party.

                     (ii) In the case any event shall have occurred which would
otherwise entitle either party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder,
no Damages shall be deemed to have been sustained by such party to the extent of
(i) any actual Tax savings realized by such party with respect thereto (the "Tax
Benefit") and (ii) in the event of an indemnification claim for Damages for lost
profits, any Taxes that would have actually been payable as a result of such
indemnification payment being includible in the taxable income of the
Indemnified Party. Except as otherwise set forth in the preceding sentence, if
any receipt of Damages are reported as income on Purchaser's or any of
Purchaser's Affiliates income tax returns, Damages shall be increased by such an
amount necessary in order for the Indemnified Party to receive a net payment,
after paying any Taxes resulting from its receipt of any indemnification payment
for such Damages, equal to the amount of Damages otherwise determined in
accordance with this Section 10.4(d). The Tax losses, deductions, credits or
other items of the Indemnified Party resulting from Damages shall be deemed to
be realized proportionately with any other Tax losses, deductions, credits or
other items available to the Indemnified Party. To the extent there is a
determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any comparable
provision of state, local or foreign law) disallowing the Tax Benefit, the
Indemnifying Party shall refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any
related reduction of Damages previously allowed pursuant to this Section
10.4(d).

                 (e) Access. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice under
this Agreement, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records and properties of such Indemnified Party
to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which the Claim Notice
relates. All such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall
be granted under conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will
not, and shall require that its representatives do not, use (except in
connection with such Claim Notice) or disclose to any third Person other than
the Indemnifying Party's representatives or agents (except as may be required by
applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to this Section 10.4(e) which
is designated as confidential by an Indemnified Party.

                 (f) Environmental Procedures. With respect to Seller's
indemnification obligations relating in any way to Environmental Laws, Materials
of Environmental Concern or Environmental Liabilities, the following provisions
shall apply:

                     (i) If such Claim relates to the release of Materials of
Environmental Concern at, on or under the Facility, the necessity for
investigation or remediation ("Corrective Action") shall be determined pursuant
to the Environmental Laws in effect at the Closing. If the Corrective Action is,
or may be required, in addition to providing access pursuant to Section 10.4(e)
above, Purchaser shall permit Seller to conduct its own investigation, testing
or corrective action with respect to the matter, at Seller's sole expense,




                                       46
<PAGE>

provided such investigation, testing or corrective action does not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Facility and the Acquired Business.

                     (ii) Purchaser and Seller shall provide the other with the
results, including analytical data, of any investigation or testing conducted by
either of them or, if available, any third party.

                     (iii) Except as may otherwise be required by Law, Purchaser
shall not contact any Governmental Authority with respect to the subject matter
of the indemnification Claim without prior notice to, and consultation with,
Seller.

                     (iv) Purchaser shall provide Seller a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Governmental Authority concerning such matter.

                     (v) If Corrective Action is required in any such matter
(pursuant to the standard above), Purchaser shall give Seller a reasonable
opportunity to develop and implement a plan of Corrective Action, such plan to
be subject to Purchaser's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld), and, if
requested by Seller, reasonably cooperate with Seller in the development and
implementation of such plan on a cost-effective basis.

                     (vi) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
performing such tasks as Seller and its technical professionals and
representatives may reasonably request as being necessary to complete any
Corrective Action being undertaken by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, with
Purchaser being compensated for any expenses incurred in connection therewith
(excluding Purchaser's employee time). Without limiting the scope of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall cause its employees to reasonably cooperate with
Seller and to afford Seller, its agents, employees and technical professionals
reasonable access to relevant records relating to the matters which may be
Seller's responsibility under this Agreement, provided that such access shall
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Facility or the Acquired
Business.

                     (vii) With respect to any Corrective Action undertaken by
Seller, Seller shall be responsible for completing such Corrective Action only
to the extent necessary to obtain closure or a "no further action" designation
from the applicable Government Authority pursuant to applicable Environmental
Laws.

                 (g) Definition of Damages. "Damages" shall mean any and all
costs, losses, (including diminution in value) Taxes, liabilities, obligations,
damages, deficiencies and expenses (whether or not arising out of Third Party
Claims), including interest, penalties, costs of mitigation, losses in
connection with any Environmental Laws (including any clean-up or remedial
action), damages to the environment, consequential damages, lost profits and
other losses resulting from any shutdown or curtailment of operations of the
Acquired Business, damages to the environment and, reasonable attorneys' fees;
provided, that "Damages" shall not include punitive damages, exemplary damages,
multiple damages, and other penalty damages except to the extent such damages
relate to or arise out of any Third Party Claim, in which case such damages
shall be included in the definition of "Damages." The term "Damages" as used in




                                       47
<PAGE>

this Section 10 is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against
Seller or Purchaser, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by Seller
Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties in the absence of Third
Party Claims.

             10.5 Limitation on Indemnification.

                 (a) No amount shall be payable by any Indemnifying Party
pursuant to Section 10.2 (a) or Section 10.3(a) unless the aggregate amount of
Damages indemnifiable under Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.3(a), respectively,
exceeds $400,000 (at which point the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to the
last $300,000 of indemnifiable Damages accrued up to such threshold and all
amounts in excess of such threshold (subject to the other applicable limitations
set forth in this Section 10.5)); provided, however, that the above limitation
shall not apply to any indemnification obligations of Seller to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising from Seller's representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.1(b) (Authorization; Validity), the second and third sentence
of 4.8(a) (Title to Purchased Assets), 4.9 (Taxes), and the second sentence of
Section 4.15(a) (Real Property) or indemnification obligations of any party
under any other provisions of Section 10.2 or Section 10.3.

                 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Damages which may be recovered by
any Purchaser Indemnified Parties from Seller and by any Seller Indemnified
Parties from Purchaser arising out of, resulting from or incident to the matters
enumerated in Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.3(a) shall be an amount equal to $5
million; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to any
indemnification obligations of Seller to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
arising from representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1(b)
(Authorization; Validity), the second and third sentence of Section 4.8(a)
(Title to Purchased Assets), Sections 4.9 (Taxes), and the second sentence of
Section 4.15(a) (Real Property) or indemnification obligations of any party
under any other provisions of Section 10.2 or Section 10.3.

                 (c) The maximum amount of lost profits and other losses
resulting from any shutdown or curtailment of operations of the Acquired
Business which may be recovered as Damages by any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
from Seller arising out of, resulting from or incident to the matters enumerated
in Section 10.3 shall be an amount equal to $6,000,000.

             10.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 10.1(b) and
except for equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific
performance, to which any party hereto may be entitled, from and after the
Closing, the indemnification obligations of Purchaser and Seller under this
Section 10 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and
Purchaser, respectively, for the breach of any covenant or representation or
warranty in this Agreement by the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be.

         11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Wisconsin, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Wisconsin or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin. No party
hereto, solely by virtue of executing this Agreement, shall be deemed to



                                       48
<PAGE>

have submitted to the personal jurisdiction of any forum or waived any objection
such party may have as to proper venue of any forum.

the parties hereto shall be solely responsible for and pay its own consulting,
accounting, legal, and other charges and expenses incurred by such party in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement,
the related agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
without obligation to pay or contribute to the expenses incurred by any other

cancelled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed on behalf
of all of the parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving
compliance.

         18. WAIVER. The failure of any party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect the
right to enforce that provision or any other provision hereof at any time
thereafter, except as specifically limited herein. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach, or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or the waver of any other term
or condition.

         19. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is deemed to be of the essence with
respect to all of the terms, covenants, representations and warranties of this
Agreement.

         20. ASSIGNMENT. Except as contemplated by Section 2.3(e), this
Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise by Seller without
the prior written consent of Purchaser. This Agreement may not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise by Purchaser without the prior written consent of
Seller, except, Purchaser may, without prior consent of any other party hereto,
transfer or assign by operation of law or otherwise this Agreement to any
Affiliate or subsidiary of Purchaser, provided that in the event Purchaser
assigns all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement,
Purchaser hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the other parties
hereto the prompt and full discharge by such subsidiary or Affiliate of all of
Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof
and Seller shall not be required to pursue any remedy against such subsidiary or
Affiliate hereunder prior to pursuing such remedy against Purchaser.

         21. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that
the other party shall be entitled to an injunction or



                                       50
<PAGE>

injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement.

         22. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. Except as provided in Section 10 as to
indemnified parties and except as contemplated by Section 2.3(e), this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

         23. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

         24. COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE SIGNATURE. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Each of the parties to
this Agreement agrees that a signature affixed to a counterpart of this
Agreement and delivered by facsimile by any Person is intended to be its, his or
her signature and shall be valid, binding and enforceable against such Person.
