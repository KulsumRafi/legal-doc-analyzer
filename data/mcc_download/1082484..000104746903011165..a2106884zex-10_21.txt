     immediately prior to the earlier of payment of any benefits or Termination
     of Employment due to Disability, the Company shall credit interest on the
     Deferral Account balance at an annual rate equal to the Modified Return on
     Equity of the Company for the Plan Year; provided, however, that such
     interest rate shall be no less than six (6.0%), nor greater than twelve
     percent (12%). The interest rate shall be retroactively applied using

     Year. In the event of a part-year interest payment, due to the commencement
     of benefits, the Modified Return on Equity of the Company for the past Plan
     Year shall be used as the part-year interest rate, and that rate shall be
     applied to the Deferral Account balance using monthly compounding for the
     period prior to the first payment of any benefits under this Agreement. No
     interest shall be credited pursuant to this Subsection 3.1.3 after payment
     begins.

trust fund of any kind. The Executive is a general unsecured creditor of the
Company for the payment of benefits. The benefits represent the mere Company
promise to pay such benefits. The Executive's rights are not subject in any
manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by the Executive's creditors.

     10.11  BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall bind the Executive and the
Company and their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, administrators and
transferees.

     10.12  NO GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT. This Agreement is not a contract for
employment. It does not give the Executive the right to remain an employee of

Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee nor
interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any time.

     10.13  NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Benefits under this Agreement cannot be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, attached or encumbered in any manner.

     10.14  TAX WITHHOLDING. The Company shall withhold any taxes that are
required to be withheld from the benefits provided under this Agreement.

     10.15  ELECTION TO OPERATE AS A SUBCHAPTER S CORPORATION. In the event that
the Company in the future elects to operate as a Subchapter S corporation under

be used to determine the after-tax income of the Company

governed by the laws of Kansas, except to the extent preempted by the laws of

are general unsecured creditors of the Company for the payment of benefits under
this Agreement. The benefits represent the mere promise by the Company to pay
such benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
attachment, or garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life
is a general asset of the Company to which the Executive and the Executive's
beneficiary have no preferred or secured claim.

     10.18  REORGANIZATION. The Company shall not merge or consolidate into or
with another company, or reorganize, or sell substantially all of its assets to
another company, firm, or person unless such succeeding or continuing company,
firm, or person agrees to assume and discharge the obligations of the Company
under this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event, the term "Company" as
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the successor or survivor
company.

     10.19  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the Company and the Executive as to the subject matter hereof. No rights
are granted to the Executive by virtue of this Agreement other than those

others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the
plan including the employment of advisors and the delegation of ministerial
duties to qualified individuals.

     10.14  FULL OBLIGATION. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, when
the Company has paid either the lifetime benefits or death benefits as
appropriate under any section of the Agreement, the Company has completed its
obligation to the Executive.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and a duly authorized Company officer
