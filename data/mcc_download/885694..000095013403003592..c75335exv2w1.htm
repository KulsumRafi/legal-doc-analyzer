<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>Des Plaines, Illinois</I>). CoVest Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq: COVB) announced today that it has cancelled its special stockholders&#146; meeting scheduled for March&nbsp;17, 2003, to approve the proposed acquisition of CoVest by Midwest Banc Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBHI). CoVest said that it has been informed by Midwest that the bank regulatory agencies have advised Midwest that they will be delaying the processing of Midwest&#146;s applications to acquire CoVest until the completion of the regularly scheduled examination of Midwest Bank which began this week. In light of such delay, CoVest said that its board of directors has decided to defer stockholder consideration of the proposed transaction pending Midwest&#146;s receipt of regulatory approvals or evidence that they will be forthcoming.
