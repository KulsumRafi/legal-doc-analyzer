                        (Effective as of January 1, 2002)

     The Board of Directors of Newmont USA Limited, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), hereby adopts the Newmont Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the
"Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2002 (the "Effective Date"). This Plan is

                                     PURPOSE
                                     -------

     The purpose of the Plan is to provide to those employees of the Company and
its Affiliated Entities (as defined herein) that participate in the Plan a more
direct interest in the success of the operations of the Company by rewarding
their successful efforts to maximize cash flow, minimize production costs, and
positively impact earnings per share. Employees of the Company and participating
Affiliated Entities will be rewarded in accordance with the terms and conditions
described below.

     1.6 "Bonus Eligible Earnings" means the total base salary earnings of the

term disability pay received during the Plan Year, but excluding pay from any
other source. If an Employee dies during the Plan Year, the "Bonus Eligible
Earnings" for such Terminated Eligible Employee will be determined by his actual
gross W-2 base earnings. If an Employee is on active military duty during a Plan
Year, the "Bonus Eligible Earnings" will be determined by his actual gross W-2
base earnings during the Plan Year, exclusive of any military pay. If an
Employee does not receive a W-2, his "Bonus Eligible Earnings" shall be
determined on the basis of his actual gross base earnings for the Plan Year, or
portion thereof, as shown on the payroll records of the Company or the
Participating Employer. In all cases, an Employee's "Bonus Eligible Earnings"
shall be computed before reduction for pre-tax contributions to an employee
benefit plan of the Company pursuant to Section 401(k) or Section 125 of the
Code. In the event of a Change of Control the Bonus Eligible Earnings of each
Eligible Employee shall be equal to such Employee's base salary, on an
annualized basis, as of the date immediately preceding the Change of Control

for the Plan Year through the date of termination of employment.

          (i) The appropriate weighting factors for each Eligible Employee shall

          factor for each performance factor (the Cash Cost per Equivalent Ounce
          Performance Percentage, the Earnings per Share Performance Percentage

          for each percentage calculated.

          spent in each applicable Pay Grade.

If the Performance Percentage of a measure is less than 100 but more than 50,
the Bonus Payout as a Percent of Target shall be the same as the Performance
Percentage. If the Performance Percentage of a measure otherwise falls between
the various Performance Percentages set forth in the foregoing Schedule, then
the Bonus Payout as a Percent of Target percentages set forth in the foregoing
Schedule shall be interpolated so that such percentage bears the same
relationship to the Performance Bonus as a Percent of Target percentages for the
two closest Performance Percentages.

     The Compensation Committee of Newmont Mining may, in its sole discretion,
adjust the Performance Percentage of any measure or otherwise increase the
Performance Bonus otherwise payable in order to reflect changed circumstances or
such other matters as the Compensation Committee of Newmont Mining deems
appropriate.

is in Pay Grade 108 or below on the last day of the Plan Year (or was in such
Pay Grade at the time of termination of employment) and who is not assigned to
the corporate office or a non-site location, will be determined in accordance
with such performance factors, weighting factors and other methods of bonus
determination as shall be established for each specific site or region by the
Company for the Plan Year. Each operating site shall develop its own Critical
Performance Indicators for this purpose.

this ARTICLE IV, except as approved by the Compensation Committee of Newmont
Mining prior to the payment of Personal Performance Bonuses, or subsequently
thereto by ratification, the amount of the Personal Performance Bonuses payable

     4.5 Ineligible Employees. Eligible Employees whose Personal Performance
Bonus Factor (determined pursuant to Section 4.1) is less than .15% shall not be

be made to another for his benefit, without responsibility of the Compensation
Committee of Newmont Mining, the Company, or any other person or entity to see
to the application of such payment. Payments made pursuant to such power shall
operate as a complete discharge of the Compensation Committee of Newmont Mining,

convenience, and they shall have no effect on the interpretation of the Plan.

construed and enforced as if such illegal and invalid provision had never been
set forth in the Plan.

deemed to confer upon any person any legal right to be employed by, or to be
retained in the employ of, the Company or any Affiliated Entity, or to give any

provided under this Plan. All Employees shall remain subject to discharge from
