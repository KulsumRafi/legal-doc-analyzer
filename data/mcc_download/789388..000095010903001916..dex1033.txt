SunGard Data Systems Inc. has a plan that permits outside directors to elect to
receive shares of SunGard common stock in lieu of cash compensation. Unless an
outside director elects in writing to receive shares in lieu of cash
compensation, all fees are paid in cash. If an outside director elects to
receive shares in lieu of cash compensation, then the shares are issued on a
quarterly basis based upon the closing price of SunGard's common stock on the
date of each quarterly board meeting. As of December 31, 2002, there were 46,385
shares reserved for issuance under this plan.
