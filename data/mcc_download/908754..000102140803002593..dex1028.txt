<PAGE>

     WHEREAS, there may be additional Notes executed by various members of the

other Party hereto with respect to any such outstanding Notes will also be

herein have authorized, by resolution, the approval of the Merger and this
Settlement Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, all Parties wish to avoid protracted and expensive litigation and
wish to allow the Merger to consummate and believe that this settlement provides
sufficient and valuable consideration to all Parties;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree to settle any and
all differences between them as follows:

         1. Consideration. As consideration for the Rance Group's agreement to
enter into this Settlement Agreement, the Murdock Group (through MCC) will
provide to the Rance Group FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND (517,000) shares of
common stock of MCC, no par value per share (the "MCC Common Stock"), which
shares shall be distributed to the Rance Group on a pro-rata basis as set forth
in Exhibit "A" hereto (the "Rance Group's Consideration"). Notwithstanding the
prior sentence, in the event that the Murdock Group provides to the Parties
listed on Exhibit "B" hereto more than 250,000 shares as settlement and release
of any pending or actual claims by those persons on Exhibit "B", then for each
additional share in excess of 250,000

                                       4

<PAGE>

shares, two (2) additional shares of the MCC Common Stock shall be distributed
to, on a pro-rata basis, the Rance Group listed on Exhibit "A" hereto. The
Parties agree that each of them and all of them collectively receive an economic
benefit by virtue of this settlement. At or prior to the Closing of the Merger,
and in accordance with the Offering Memorandum attached hereto as Exhibit "C"
and each member of the Rance Group's subscription therefor, MCC shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent pursuant to and as defined in Exhibit "6" of the Offering
Memorandum, Five Hundred Seventeen Thousand (517,000) authorized shares of MCC
Common Stock. The Parties agree that: (a) the MCC Common Stock shall be offered
and issued to the Rance Group under the private offering exemptions from
registration available under the Securities Act and the laws of the States in
which the Shares will be sold, and that the Shares offered pursuant to Exhibit
"C" hereto will not, prior to issuance, be registered under the Securities Act
or under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. As a result,
the Shares as initially issued cannot be transferred without registration under
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption
therefrom, and the Shares will be "restricted securities" as that term is
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act; and (b) MCC shall register with
the Securities and Exchange Commission the resale by the Rance Group of the
shares prior to the closing of the Merger, (at MCC's sole expense, which
registration may also include any other securities to be sold by MCC, and
successor of MCC or any other security holder of MCC or any successor of MCC),
and the registration shall cause the shares to be freely tradable by the Rance
Group at or prior to the closing of the Merger; and (c) that none of the
attorneys, including but not limited to ARENSON & ZIMMERMANN, P.L.C.,

                                       5

FIRM, P.C., that represent any of the Murdock Group entities (as defined in this
Agreement) (i) have been involved in the offer and sale of securities, (ii)
conducted due diligence on, (iii) passed upon the facts or legality of, (iv) or
rendering an opinion upon the Offering Memorandum, (v) or are recommending or
endorsing the Offering Memorandum to the Rance Group. The Rance Group's decision
to invest in the offering made pursuant to the Offering Memorandum is based
solely upon their respective independent review and consideration of their
individual investment objectives, risk tolerances, financial conditions and
liquidity needs. The attorneys representing the various entities comprising the
Murdock Group have not advised the members of the Rance Group and will not
advise the members of the Rance Group as to the nature, potential, value or
suitability of the securities offered through the Offering Memorandum or an
investment in any security issued by MCC, and the Rance Group acknowledges that
it has not relied upon any representations of the attorneys in evaluating or
accepting any offer to purchase securities, and understands that none of the
attorneys are rendering any opinions as to the propriety of the disclosures in
the Offering Memorandum and its exhibits. By executing the Settlement Agreement,
the members of the Rance Group acknowledge and agree to be bound by this
disclosure.

Agreement is executed by all of the Parties hereto, the Murdock Group shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in Exhibit "6"
of the Offering Memorandum, the Rance Group's Consideration set forth in
Paragraph 1, above. At the Effective Time, the Escrow Agent shall make a
distribution of the Rance Group's

                                       6

<PAGE>

Consideration to the Rance Group, or its designee, pursuant to the schedule set
forth in Exhibit "A" hereto. The Murdock Group shall distribute no shares to
those persons listed on Exhibit "B" hereto until the Effective Time.

     3. Tax Treatment. The Rance Group acknowledge that the Murdock Group have
made no representations or warranties whatsoever concerning the treatment for
tax purposes of any of the Rance Group's Consideration provided pursuant to this
Settlement Agreement, that they have not relied upon any such representations or
warranties, and that the terms of this Settlement Agreement are not intended to
guarantee any particular tax treatment with regard to any of the Rance Group's
Consideration provided pursuant to this Settlement Agreement.

     4. Mutual Release of Claims ("Release"). Upon fulfillment of the
obligations of each of the Rance Group and Murdock Group as set forth in this
Settlement Agreement, the Parties are hereby: (a) each by the other released,
acquitted, and forever discharged, together with their respective parent
companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
servants, all persons and entities in privy with them, or any of them, their
heirs, assigns and predecessors or successors in interest; and (b) the Parties
covenant not to institute, prosecute, or in any way aid in the institution or
prosecution of any and all claims, complaints, causes of action or demands of
whatever kind which they now have, had in the past, at common law, statutory law
or otherwise, against each other arising out of or from any actions, conduct,
decisions, behavior or events occurring up to or on the date of their signatures
on this Settlement Agreement, including but not limited to, those claims set
forth in the action against the Murdock Group in United States District Court,
Southern District of Iowa, File No. 4-01

                                       7

<PAGE>

CV 90030 (Consolidated), and including but not limited to any claims related to
the Notes, irrespective of whether the Notes are reflected on the books of MCC.
BY THIS RELEASE, THE PARTIES GIVE UP ANY RIGHT TO MAKE OR CONTINUE TO PURSUE ANY
CLAIM, BRING OR MAINTAIN A LAWSUIT, FILE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM, OR OTHERWISE
SEEK MONEY DAMAGES, EQUITABLE RELIEF, OR COURT ORDERS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN CLAIMS ACCRUED PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

     5. Dissolution of Settlement Agreement on Failure of Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Settlement Agreement, or in any
of the terms of this Settlement Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that if the
Merger does not become effective pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
then this Settlement Agreement shall dissolve and terminate, and each and every
one of the Parties to this Settlement Agreement shall be released from any and
all of that party's obligations and duties hereunder.

     6. Stay of Litigation. The Parties hereto shall take all necessary steps to
stay the litigation related to the Third-Party Complaint pending in the United
States District Court, Southern District of Iowa, File No. 4-01 CV 90030
(Consolidated) pending consummation of the Merger, except that the Murdock Group
shall not be required to agree to the extension of any statutes of limitations
except for that period of time during which the action was stayed by Court
Order. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, all statutes of limitation defenses
of the Murdock Group which are pending before the Court in the Murdock Group's
Motion to Dismiss at the time this Settlement Agreement is executed shall be
preserved.

attached hereto as Exhibit "E". The stipulation will be filed and submitted to
the Court for approval within three (3) days after the consummation of the

     9. No Third-Party Benefit/Representation and Warranty. Nothing in this
Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to create any right or obligation in any

the benefit of or binding upon any person not a party hereto. Each Party to this
Agreement represents and warrants that no other person or entity has any
interest in the cause of action involved in this Settlement Agreement and it has
not assigned, sold, transferred, or

                                       9

persons, places, and circumstances shall remain in full force and effect.

     13. Counterparts. This Settlement Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each one of which shall be an original and all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     14. Governing Law. This Settlement Agreement shall be interpreted according
to the laws of the State of Iowa in the United States of America, and the
