held by such Optionee shall thereupon terminate; and (ii) if an Optionee incurs
a Termination of Employment for any reason other than death, Disability or

in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and
that, as a condition of any Award of Restricted Stock, the Awardee shall have
delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered
by such Award.

         (b) Restricted Stock Units shall represent the right to receive, at a
specified time or times, either a specified number of shares of Common Stock, or
a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of a specified number of shares of
Common Stock, as the Committee shall determine.

7.3      Terms and Conditions

         The terms and conditions of an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted
Stock Units as established by the Committee shall be set forth in an Award
Agreement, including the following:

         (a) The Committee may, in connection with the grant, designate an Award
of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units as a Qualified Performance-Based
Award, in which event it shall condition the grant or vesting (generally, during
a period of three years), as applicable, of such Award upon the attainment of
Performance Goals. If the Committee does not designate an Award of Restricted
Stock or Restricted Stock Units as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, it may
also condition the grant or vesting thereof upon the attainment of Performance
Goals. Regardless of whether an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock
Units is a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the Committee may also condition
the grant or vesting thereof upon the continued service of the Awardee. The
conditions for grant or vesting and the other provisions of Awards of Restricted
Stock or Restricted Stock Units (including any applicable Performance Goals)
need not be the same with respect to each Awardee. The Committee may at any
time, in its sole discretion, accelerate or waive, in whole or in part, any of
the foregoing restrictions; provided, however, that in the case of an Award that
is a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the applicable Performance Goals have
been satisfied. The total number of shares represented by Qualified Performance
Based Award granted under the Plan shall not exceed 100,000.

         (b) Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award
Agreement, during the period, if any, set by the Committee, commencing with the
date of such Award for which such Awardee's continued service is required (the
"Restriction Period"), and until the later of (i) the expiration of the
Restriction Period and (ii) the date the applicable Performance Goals (if any)
are satisfied, the Awardee shall not be permitted to sell, assign, transfer,
pledge or otherwise encumber shares of Restricted Stock or an Award of
Restricted Stock Units; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent an Awardee
from pledging Restricted Stock as security for a loan, the sole purpose of which
is to provide funds to pay the option price for Stock Options.

         (c) Except as provided in this paragraph (c) and Articles 7.3(a) and
7.3(b) and the applicable Award Agreement, the Awardee shall have, with respect
to shares of Restricted Stock (but not Restricted Stock Units), all of the
rights of a stockholder of the Company holding the class or series of Common
Stock that is the subject of the Restricted Stock, including, if applicable, the
right to vote the shares and the right to receive any cash dividends. Unless
otherwise determined by the Committee and subject to the next sentence, (A) cash
dividends on the class or series of Common Stock that are the subject of the
Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically
deferred and reinvested in additional Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock
Units, as applicable, held subject to the vesting of the underlying Award, and
(B) dividends payable in Common Stock shall be paid in the form of additional
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, held subject to the
vesting of the underlying Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision
of an Award Agreement, reinvestment of dividends in additional Restricted Stock
or Restricted Stock Units shall only be permissible if sufficient shares of
Common Stock are available under the Plan for such reinvestment (taking into
account then outstanding Awards).

                                        9

<PAGE>

         (d) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the applicable Award
Agreement and Articles 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.3(e) and 10.1(b), upon an Awardee's
Termination of Employment for any reason during the Restriction Period or before
the applicable Performance Goals are satisfied, all shares of Restricted Stock
and all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited
by the Awardee.

         (e) Except to the extent otherwise provided in Article 10.1(b), in the
event an of an Awardee's Retirement or involuntary Termination of Employment
other than for Cause, the Committee shall have the discretion to waive, in whole
or in part, any or all remaining restrictions (other than, in the case of
Restricted Stock with respect to which an Awardee is a Covered Employee,
satisfaction of the applicable Performance Goals unless the Termination of
Employment was by reason of the Awardee's death or Disability) with respect to
any or all of such Awardee's shares of Restricted Stock.

         (f) If and when any applicable Performance Goals are satisfied and the
Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock,
unlegended certificates for such shares shall be delivered to the Awardee upon
surrender of the legended certificates.

ARTICLE 8         PERFORMANCE UNITS

8.1      Administration

         Performance Units may be awarded either alone or in addition to other
Awards granted under the Plan. The Committee shall determine the Employees to
whom and the time or times at which Performance Units shall be awarded, the
number of Performance Units to be awarded to any Awardee (subject to the
aggregate limit on grants to individual Awardees set forth in Article 3), the
duration of the Award Cycle and any other terms and conditions of the Award, in
addition to those contained in Article 8.2.

8.2      Terms and Conditions

         The terms and conditions of Performance Units as established by the
Committee shall be set forth in an Award Agreement, including the following:

         (a) The Committee may, prior to or at the time of the grant, designate
Performance Units as Qualified Performance-Based Awards, in which event it shall
condition the settlement thereof upon the attainment of Performance Goals. If
the Committee does not designate Performance Units as Performance-Based Awards,
it may also condition the settlement thereof upon the attainment of Performance
Goals. Regardless of whether Performance Units are Qualified Performance-Based
Awards, the Committee may also condition the settlement thereof upon the
continued service of the Awardee. The provisions of such Awards (including any
applicable Performance Goals) need not be the same with respect to each Awardee.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement,
Performance Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise
encumbered during the Award Cycle.

         (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the applicable Award
Agreement and Articles 8.2(c) and 10.1(c), upon an Awardee's Termination of
Employment for any reason during the Award Cycle or before any applicable
Performance Goals are satisfied, all rights to receive cash or stock in
settlement of the Performance Units shall be forfeited by the Awardee.

         (c) Except to the extent otherwise provided in Article 10.1(c), in the
event of an Awardee's Termination of Employment for any reason other than

Cause, the Committee shall have the discretion to waive, in whole or in part,
any or all remaining payment limitations and other restrictions applicable to
any or all of such Awardee's Performance Units; provided, that in the case of
Performance Units that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards, the applicable
Performance Goals are satisfied unless the Awardee's Termination of Employment
occurred by reason of the Awardee's death or Disability).

         (d) At the expiration of the Award Cycle, the Committee shall evaluate
the Company's performance in light of any Performance Goals for such Award, and
shall determine the number of Performance Units granted to the

                                       10

<PAGE>

Awardee which have been earned, and the Committee shall then cause to be
delivered (i) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of
Performance Units determined by the Committee to have been earned, or (ii) cash
equal to the Fair Market Value of such number of shares of Common Stock to the
Awardee, as the Committee shall elect.

ARTICLE 9         STOCK PAYMENTS; DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

9.1      Stock Payments

         Stock Payments may be made under this Plan either alone or in
conjunction with any other Award, on such terms and conditions as the Committee
may determine.

9.2      Dividend Equivalents

         Dividend Equivalents may be granted under this Plan either alone or in
conjunction with any other Award. Dividend Equivalents shall represent the right
to receive cash payments, shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof,
having a value equal to the dividends declared on Common Stock during a
specified period, and subject to such other terms and conditions as the
Committee shall determine.

ARTICLE 10        CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS

10.1     Impact of Event

         Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the
event of a Change in Control:

         (a) Any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the
date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred, and which are not
then exercisable and vested, shall become fully exercisable and vested, and
shall remain exercisable until their Expiration Date notwithstanding any
Termination of Employment of the relevant Optionee other than a Termination of
Employment for Cause.

         (b) The restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, and such Restricted
Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become
fully vested and transferable.

         (c) All Performance Units shall be considered to be earned and payable
in full, and any deferral or other restriction shall lapse and such Performance

         (d) Any restrictions or deferral or forfeiture limitations applicable
to any Stock Payment or Dividend Equivalents shall lapse.

Personnel Committee of the Board or such other committee of the Board, as may
from time to be selected by the Board.

11.2     Powers of Committee

         (a) The Committee shall have the authority to conduct the general
administration of this Plan in accordance with its provisions. The Committee
shall have the power to make Awards and set the terms and conditions for such
Awards (including the option price, any vesting condition, restriction or
limitation (which may be related to the performance of the Awardee, the Company
or any Subsidiary) and any vesting acceleration or forfeiture waiver regarding
any Award and the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based on such factors
as the Committee shall determine; to modify, amend or adjust the terms and
conditions of any Award, at any time or from time to time, including Performance
Goals; provided, however, that the Committee may not adjust upwards the amount
payable with respect to a Qualified Performance-Based Award or waive or alter
the Performance Goals associated therewith except as specifically permitted by
the Plan; to determine to what extent and under what circumstances Common Stock
and other amounts payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred; and to
determine under what circumstances an Award may be settled in cash or Common
Stock under Articles 5, 6, 8 and 9, as applicable. The Committee shall have the
power to interpret this Plan and the Awards made hereunder, to adopt such rules
and procedures for the administration, interpretation, and application of this
Plan as are consistent

                                       12

<PAGE>

therewith, and to interpret, amend or revoke any such rules and procedures. Any
Award under this Plan need not be the same with respect to each Awardee.

         (b) Any determination made by the Committee or pursuant to delegated
authority pursuant to the provisions of the Plan with respect to any Award shall
be made in the sole discretion of the Committee or such delegate at the time of
the grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the
Plan, at any time thereafter. All decisions made by the Committee or any
appropriately delegated officer pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be
final and binding on all persons, including the Company, Awardees and
Beneficiaries.

11.3     Action by Committee

         (a) The Committee shall act by a majority of its members in office. The
Committee may act either by vote at a meeting, or by a memorandum or other
written instrument signed by a majority of the Committee. The Committee may
delegate to (i) the CEO the authority to make decisions pursuant to, and
interpretations of, the Plan (provided that no such delegation may be made that
would cause Awards or other transactions under the Plan to cease to be exempt
from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or cause Qualified Performance-Based
Awards to fail to qualify for the Section 162(m) exemption), including the
authority to grant Awards to any Employee who is not an "officer" of the Company
(within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as
amended), subject to any limitations the Committee may impose, and (ii) the CEO
or Secretary, or both, or any or all of the administrative and interpretive
duties and authority of the Committee under the Plan.

         (b) Any authority granted to the Committee under this Plan may also be
exercised by the full Board, except to the extent that the grant or exercise of
such authority would cause any Award designated as a Qualified Performance-Based
Award not to qualify for, or to cease to qualify for, the Section 162(m)
Exemption. To the extent that any permitted action taken by the Board conflicts
with action taken by the Committee, the Board action shall control.

11.4     Compensation; Professional Assistance; Good Faith Actions

         Expenses and liabilities which members of the Committee incur in
connection with the administration of this Plan shall be borne by the Company.
The Committee may employ attorneys, consultants, accountants, appraisers,
brokers, or other persons. The Committee, the Company, and its officers and
Directors shall be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions or valuations of
any such persons. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations
made by the Committee in good faith shall be final and binding upon all Awardees
and Beneficiaries, the Company, and all other interested persons. No members of
the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or
interpretation made in good faith with respect to this Plan, any Option, any
Stock Appreciation Right, any Performance Award, any Dividend Equivalent, any
Stock Payment, or any Restricted Stock, and all members of the Committee shall
be fully protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination
or interpretation.

ARTICLE 12        MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

12.1     Not Transferable

         Except as specifically provided in the Plan with respect to Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights, as provided in Article 12.8 regarding designation of
Beneficiaries, and as may be otherwise provided in the applicable Award
Agreement: (i) Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in any
manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; (ii) no Award
or interest or right therein shall be subject to the debts, contracts or
engagements of the Awardee or his Beneficiaries and successors in interest or
shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge,
encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary
or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment
or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy); and (iii)
any attempted disposition of an Award shall be null and void and of no effect.

12.2     Unfunded Status of Plan

         It is presently intended that the Plan constitutes an "unfunded" plan
for incentive and deferred compensation. The Committee may authorize the
creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations

                                       13

<PAGE>

created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or make payments; provided,
however, that unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such
trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the
Plan.

12.3     General Provisions

         (a) The Committee may require each person purchasing or receiving
shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award, as a condition to delivery of such
shares, to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person
is acquiring the shares without a view to the distribution thereof and to
provide such other representations and such documents as the Committee, in its
absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with
all applicable laws. Such shares may be delivered in by book entry or in
certificate form, with such legends or other notations as the Committee deems
appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.

         (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award
Agreement, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any shares of
Common Stock under the Plan prior to fulfillment of all of the following
conditions:

                  (i) Listing or approval for listing upon notice of issuance,
         of such shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., or such other
         securities exchange as may at the time be the principal market for the
         Common Stock;

                  (ii) Any registration or other qualification of such shares of
         the Company under any state or federal law or regulation, or the
         maintaining in effect of any such registration or other qualification
         which the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion upon the advice
         of counsel, deem necessary or advisable;

                  (iii) Obtaining any other consent, approval, or permit from
         any state or federal governmental agency, which the Committee shall, in
         its absolute discretion after receiving the advice of counsel,
         determine to be necessary or advisable;

                  (iv) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the
         exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the vesting or
         other event that results in the settlement of an Award, as the
         Committee may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative
         convenience; and

                  (v) The receipt by the Company of full payment (if any) for
         such shares and the satisfaction of any tax withholding obligations
         relating thereto.

An Awardee shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a
stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares of Common Stock that may
become deliverable pursuant to an Award unless and until such shares have been
delivered to the Awardee.

         (c) In the event an Award is granted to an Employee who is employed
outside the United States and who is not compensated from a payroll maintained
in the United States, the Committee may, in its discretion, modify the
provisions of the Plan as they pertain to such Award or Awardee to comply with
applicable foreign law, and/or related regulations or requirements.

         (d) The Committee may (but need not) establish rules under which
Awardees may be permittd to elect to defer receipt of cash or shares in
settlement of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Units for a specified period
or until a specified event, either under an existing plan of the Company or
otherwise.

12.4     Amendment, Suspension, or Termination of this Plan
         The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time [prior
to a Change of Control], but no such amendment, suspension or termination shall
impair the rights of Awardees under Awards previously granted without the
Awardee's consent. In addition, no such amendment shall be made without the
approval of the Company's stockholders to the extent such approval is required
by applicable law or the rules of any exchange on which the Common Shares are
then listed.

                                       14

<PAGE>

         The Committee may amend the terms of any Award after it is granted,
prospectively or retroactively, but no such amendment shall reprice an option,
cause a Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the Section
162(m) Exemption or impair the rights of the Awardee without the Awardee's
consent.

12.5     Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock

         In the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split,
share combination, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, acquisition of
property or shares, separation, spinoff, reorganization, stock rights offering,
liquidation, Disaffiliation of a Subsidiary or similar event, the Committee
shall make such adjustments (if any) as it deems appropriate and equitable, in
its discretion, to the following:

         (a) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available under
         Article 2.1 and Article 7.1, and the limits on grants of Options under
         Article 3.2 and grants of Qualifying Performance-Based Awards under
         Articles 7 and 8; (b) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
         outstanding Awards; (c) the option price of outstanding Options, and
         (d) such other adjustments to outstanding Awards as the Committee may
         determine to be appropriate and equitable;

Such adjustments may include, without limitation, (i) the cancellation of
outstanding Awards in exchange for payments of cash, property or a combination
thereof having an aggregate value equal to the value of such Awards, as
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, (ii) the substitution of
other property (including, without limitation, other securities) for the Stock
covered by outstanding Awards, and (iii) in connection with any Disaffiliation
of a Subsidiary, arranging for the assumption, or replacement with new awards,
of Awards held by Awardees employed by the affected Subsidiary by the Subsidiary
or an entity that controls the Subsidiary following the Disaffiliation.

12.6     Approval of Plan by Stockholders

         This Plan, as amended and restated, was approved by the Board on
February 27, 2003, and will be submitted for the approval by the Company's
stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 24, 2003.

12.7     Tax Withholding

         No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible
in the gross income of an Awardee for federal income tax purposes with respect
to any Award under the Plan, such an Awardee shall pay to the Company, or make
arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal,
state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with
respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Company, withholding
obligations may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is
part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement; provided,
however, that not more than the legally required minimum withholding may be
settled with Common Stock. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall
be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any
such taxes from any payment otherwise due to such an Awardee. The Committee may
establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including making irrevocable
elections, for the settlement of withholding obligations with Common Stock.

12.8     Beneficiaries

         The Committee or the Company shall establish such procedures as it
deems appropriate for Awardees to designate one or more persons (each, a
"Beneficiary") to whom any amounts payable under this Plan in the event of the
applicable Awardee's death are to be paid and/or by whom any rights of the
applicable Awardee's, after the Awardee's death, may be exercised. Designation,
revocation and redesignation of Beneficiaries must be made in writing in
accordance with procedures established by the Committee or the Company, and
shall be effective upon delivery to the Committee or the Company.

12.10    Effect of Plan

         The adoption of this Plan shall not affect any other compensation or
incentive plans in effect for the

                                       15

<PAGE>

Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to limit the
right of the Company (a) to establish any other forms of incentives or
compensation for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or
assume options or other rights otherwise than under this Plan in connection with
any proper corporate purpose, including the grant or assumption of options in
connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, firm or
association. Nothing in this Plan or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon
any Awardee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary
or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Awardee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause.

12.11    Titles

         Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as
a basis for interpretation or construction of this Plan.

12.12    Governing Law

interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of Delaware, without
reference to the principle of conflict of laws.
