                                      -22-

<PAGE>

     (b) Swing Line Revolving Facility. Loans to the Borrower under the Swing
Line Revolving Facility (each a "Swing Line Revolving Loan" and, collectively,
the "Swing Line Revolving Loans"): (i) shall be made only by the Swing Line
Lender; (ii) may be made at any time and from time to time on and after the

time outstanding its Swing Line Revolving Commitment at such time.

     (c) Increase in General Revolving Commitments.

          (i) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent
     from time to time, request that the Total General Revolving Commitment be
     increased by an amount not to exceed the Incremental General Revolving
     Facility Amount at such time. The Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy
     thereof to each Lender with a General Revolving Commitment. Such notice
     shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in the Total General
     Revolving Commitment (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000
     and a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or equal to the remaining Incremental
     General Revolving Facility Amount) and the date on which such increase is
     requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business
     Days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice and that, in any
     event, must be on or prior to the Maturity Date), and shall offer each
     Lender (each such Lender so agreeing being an "Increasing General Revolving
     Lender" and each such Lender declining or being deemed to have declined
     being a "Non-Increasing General Revolving Lender") or such other banks or
     entities (any such bank or other entity referred to in this clause being an
     "Augmenting General Revolving Lender") the opportunity to increase its
     General Revolving Commitment or to extend additional General Revolving
     Commitments. Each Augmenting General Revolving Lender, if not already a
     Lender with a General Revolving Commitment hereunder, shall be subject to
     the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be
     unreasonably withheld), and the Company and each Augmenting General
     Revolving Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative
     Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence its General Revolving Commitment
     and/or its status as a Lender with a General Revolving Commitment
     hereunder. Any increase in the Total General Revolving Commitment may be
     made in an amount that is less than the increase requested by the Company
     if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for,
     Augmenting General Revolving Lenders.

          (ii) Each of the parties hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent
     may take any and all actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that
     after giving effect to any increase in the Total General Revolving
     Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), the outstanding General
     Revolving Loans (if any) are held by the Lenders with General Revolving
     Commitments in accordance with their new General Revolving Facility
     Percentages. This may be accomplished at the discretion of the
     Administrative Agent: (w) by requiring the outstanding General Revolving
     Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of new Borrowings; (x) by causing
     Non-Increasing Revolving Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding
     General Revolving Loans to Increasing General Revolving Lenders and
     Augmenting General Revolving Lenders; (y) by permitting the Borrowings
     outstanding at the time of any increase in the Total General Revolving
     Commitment pursuant to this section 2.1(c) to remain outstanding until the
     last days of the respective Interest Periods therefor, even though the
     Lenders would hold such Borrowings other than in accordance with their new
     Revolving Facility Percentages; or (z) by any combination of the foregoing.
     Any prepayment or assignment described in this paragraph (ii) shall be
     subject to section 2.11 hereof but otherwise without premium or penalty.

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Total General
     Revolving Credit Commitment (or in the General Revolving Commitment of any
     Lender) or addition of a new Lender shall become effective under this
     section 2.1(c) unless: (x) on the date of such increase, the conditions set
     forth in section 7.2 shall be satisfied, and the Administrative Agent shall
     have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by
     a responsible financial officer of the Company; and (y) the Administrative
     Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders
     with General Revolving Commitments) certificates, legal opinions, board
     resolutions and an officer's certificate consistent with those delivered on
     the Closing Date under sections 7.1(c), (d), (e) and (f).

          (iv) Nothing in this section 2.1(c) shall be deemed to require any
     Lender to increase its General Revolving Commitment at any time without the
     written consent of such Lender.

     2.2. Minimum Borrowing Amounts, etc.; Pro Rata Borrowings. (a) The
aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing by the Borrower shall not be less
than the Minimum Borrowing Amount. More than one Borrowing may be incurred by
the Borrower on any day, provided that: (i) if there are two or more Borrowings
on a single day under the General Revolving Facility that consist of Eurodollar
Loans, each such Borrowing shall have a different initial Interest Period; (ii)
only one Borrowing under the Swing Line Revolving Facility may be made on any
single day; and (iii) at no time shall there be more than an aggregate of 8
Borrowings under the General Revolving Facility and the Swing Line Revolving
Facility.

     (b) All Borrowings under a Facility shall be made by the Lenders having
Commitments under such Facility pro rata on the basis of their respective
Commitments under such Facility. It is understood that no Lender shall be
responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to
be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to
fulfill its Commitment hereunder.

     2.3. Procedures for Borrowing. (a) Notice of Borrowing. Whenever the
Borrower desires to incur Loans, it shall give the Administrative Agent at its
Notice Office:

Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender that has a Commitment under
any applicable Facility written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed
in writing) of each proposed Borrowing under the applicable Facility, of such
Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the
Notice of Borrowing relating thereto.

     (b) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans Denominated in an Alternative Currency.
In the case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Loans that are Eurodollar Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency, the obligation of each affected Lender
to make its Eurodollar Loan in the requested Alternative Currency as part of
such Borrowing is subject to:

          (A) if such requested Alternative Currency is an Alternative Currency
     described in clause (i) of the definition of the term Alternative Currency,
     the confirmation by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower not later than
     the fourth Business Day before the requested date of such Borrowing that
     such Alternative Currency is readily and freely transferable and
     convertible into Dollars, or

          (B) if such requested Alternative Currency is not an Alternative
     Currency described in clause (i) of the definition of the term Alternative
     Currency, the confirmation by such Lender to the Administrative Agent not
     later than the fourth Business Day before the requested date of such
     Borrowing that such Alternative Currency is acceptable to such Lender,
     which confirmation shall be notified immediately by the Administrative
     Agent to the Borrower.

If the Administrative Agent shall not have provided the confirmation referred to
in clause (A) above, or any affected Lender shall not have so provided to the
Administrative Agent the confirmation referred to in clause (B) above, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each affected Lender
that a Lender has not provided any such confirmation referred to in such clause
(B), whereupon the Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent not later
than the third Business Day before the requested date of such Borrowing,
withdraw the Notice of Borrowing relating to such requested Borrowing. If the
Borrower does so withdraw such Notice of Borrowing, the Borrowing requested in
such Notice of Borrowing shall not occur and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly so notify each affected Lender. If the Borrower does not so withdraw
such Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify each
affected Lender and such Notice of Borrowing shall be deemed to be a Notice of
Borrowing that requests a Borrowing of Loans comprised of Eurodollar Loans in an
aggregate amount in Dollars equivalent, on the date the Administrative Agent so
notifies each affected Lender, to the amount of the originally requested
Borrowing in an Alternative Currency; and in such notice by the Administrative
Agent to each affected Lender the Administrative Agent shall state such
aggregate equivalent amount of such Borrowing in Dollars and such Lender's
ratable portion of such Borrowing.

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

     (c) Actions by Administrative Agent on Telephonic Notice. Without in any
way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic
notice permitted to be given hereunder, the Administrative Agent may act prior
to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such
telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from
an Authorized Officer of the Borrower entitled to give telephonic notices under
this Agreement on behalf of the Borrower. In each such case, the Administrative
Agent's record of the terms of such telephonic notice shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

     2.4. Disbursement of Funds. (a) No later than 2:00 P.M. (local time at the
Payment Office) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender
with a Commitment under the Facility under which any Borrowing pursuant to such
Notice of Borrowing is to be made will make available its pro rata share, if
any, of each Borrowing under such Facility requested to be made on such date in
the manner provided below. All amounts shall be made available to the
Administrative Agent in U.S. dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency and
immediately available funds at the Payment Office and the Administrative Agent
promptly will make available to the Borrower by depositing to its account at the
Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available in the type of
funds received. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any
Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make
available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings
to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of
Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may
(in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to
the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact
made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative
Agent has made available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower,
and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover
from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding
amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the
date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a
rate per annum equal to (x) if paid by such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds
Effective Rate, in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, or at the
weighted average overnight or weekend borrowing rate for immediately available
and freely transferrable funds in the applicable Alternative Currency that is
offered to the Administrative Agent in the international markets, in the case of
any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, or (y) if paid by the Borrower,
the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with section 2.8,
for the respective Loans (but without any requirement to pay any amounts in
respect thereof pursuant to section 2.11).

     (b) Nothing herein and no subsequent termination of the Commitments
pursuant to section 5.1 or 5.2 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder and in existence from time to
time or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as
a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

     2.5. Refunding of, or Participation in, Swing Line Revolving Loans. (a) If
any Event of Default exists, the Swing Line Lender may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, direct that the Swing Line Revolving Loans owing to it be refunded
by delivering a notice to such effect to the Administrative Agent, specifying
the aggregate principal amount thereof (a "Notice of Swing Line Refunding").
Promptly upon receipt of a Notice of Swing Line Refunding, the Administrative
Agent shall give notice of the contents thereof to the Lenders with General
Revolving Commitments and, unless an Event of Default specified in section
11.1(g) in respect of the Borrower has occurred, also to the Borrower. Each such
Notice of Swing Line Refunding shall be deemed to constitute delivery by the
Borrower of a Notice

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

of Borrowing requesting General Revolving Loans consisting of Prime Rate Loans
in the amount of the Swing Line Revolving Loans to which it relates. Each Lender
with a General Revolving Commitment (including the Swing Line Lender, in its
capacity as a Lender) hereby unconditionally agrees (notwithstanding that any of
the conditions specified in section 7.2 hereof or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall not have been satisfied, but subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)
below) to make a General Revolving Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to
such Lender's General Revolving Facility Percentage of the aggregate amount of
the Swing Line Revolving Loans to which such Notice of Swing Line Refunding
relates. Each such Lender shall make the amount of such General Revolving Loan
available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the
Payment Office not later than 2:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment Office), if
such notice is received by such Lender prior to 11:00 A.M. (local time at its
Domestic Lending Office), or not later than 2:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment
Office) on the next Business Day, if such notice is received by such Lender
after such time. The proceeds of such General Revolving Loans shall be made
immediately available to the Swing Line Lender and applied by it to repay the
principal amount of the Swing Line Revolving Loans to which such Notice of Swing
Line Refunding related. The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
General Revolving Loans made as herein provided in response to a Notice of Swing
Line Refunding shall constitute General Revolving Loans hereunder consisting of
Prime Rate Loans.

     (b) If prior to the time a General Revolving Loan would otherwise have been
made as provided above as a consequence of a Notice of Swing Line Refunding, any
of the events specified in section 11.1(g) shall have occurred in respect of the
Borrower or one or more of the Lenders with General Revolving Commitments shall
determine that it is legally prohibited from making a General Revolving Loan
under such circumstances, each Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender), or
each Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender) so prohibited, as the case may
be, shall, on the date such General Revolving Loan would have been made by it
(the "Purchase Date"), purchase an undivided participating interest in the
outstanding Swing Line Revolving Loans to which such Notice of Swing Line
Refunding related, in an amount (the "Swing Line Participation Amount") equal to
such Lender's General Revolving Facility Percentage of such Swing Line Revolving
Loans. On the Purchase Date, each such Lender or each such Lender so prohibited,
as the case may be, shall pay to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available
funds, such Lender's Swing Line Participation Amount, and promptly upon receipt
thereof the Swing Line Lender shall, if requested by such other Lender, deliver
to such Lender a participation certificate, dated the date of the Swing Line
Lender's receipt of the funds from, and evidencing such Lender's participating
interest in such Swing Line Revolving Loans and its Swing Line Participation
Amount in respect thereof. If any amount required to be paid by a Lender to the
Swing Line Lender pursuant to the above provisions in respect of any Swing Line
Participation Amount is not paid on the date such payment is due, such Lender
shall pay to the Swing Line Lender on demand interest on the amount not so paid
at the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate from the due date until such
amount is paid in full.

     (c) Whenever, at any time after the Swing Line Lender has received from any
other Lender such Lender's Swing Line Participation Amount, the Swing Line
Lender receives any payment from or on behalf of the Borrower on account of the
related Swing Line Revolving Loans, the Swing Line Lender will promptly
distribute to such Lender its General Revolving Facility Percentage of such
payment on account of its Swing Line Participation Amount (appropriately
adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during
which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded);
provided, however, that in the event such payment received by the Swing Line
Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Swing Line
Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swing Line
Lender.

     (d) Each Lender's obligation to make General Revolving Loans and/or to
purchase participations in connection with a Notice of Swing Line Refunding
(that shall in all events be within

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

such Lender's Unutilized General Revolving Commitment, taking into account all
outstanding participations in connection with Swing Line Refundings) shall be
subject to the conditions that:

          (i) such Lender shall have received a Notice of Swing Line Refunding
     complying with the provisions hereof, and

          (ii) at the time the Swing Line Revolving Loans that are the subject
     of such Notice of Swing Line Refunding were made, the Swing Line Lender had
     no actual written notice from another Lender that an Event of Default had
     occurred and was continuing,

but otherwise shall be absolute and unconditional, shall be solely for the
benefit of the Swing Line Lender, and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including, without limitation, (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right that such Lender may have against any other Lender, the
Borrower, or any other person, may have against any Lender or other person, as
the case may be, for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of
a Default or Event of Default; (C) any event or circumstance involving a
Material Adverse Effect upon the Borrower; (D) any breach of any Credit Document
by any party thereto; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event, whether
or not similar to any of the foregoing.

     2.6. Notes and Loan Accounts. (a) Forms of Notes. The Borrower's obligation
to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loans made to it by each Lender
shall be evidenced: (i) if General Revolving Loans, by a promissory note
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 with blanks appropriately completed in
conformity herewith (each a "General Revolving Note" and, collectively, the
"General Revolving Notes"); and (ii) if Swing Line Revolving Loans, by a
promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 with blanks
appropriately completed in conformity herewith (the "Swing Line Revolving
Note").

     (b) General Revolving Notes. The General Revolving Note issued to a Lender
with a General Revolving Commitment shall: (i) be executed by the Borrower; (ii)
be payable to the order of such Lender and be dated on or prior to the date the
first Loan evidenced thereby is made; (iii) be in a stated principal amount
equal to the General Revolving Commitment of such Lender and be payable in the
principal amount of General Revolving Loans evidenced thereby; (iv) mature on
the Maturity Date; (v) bear interest as provided in section 2.8 in respect of
the Prime Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans, as the case may be, evidenced
thereby; (vi) be subject to mandatory prepayment as provided in section 6.2; and
(vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents.

     (c) Swing Line Revolving Note. The Swing Line Revolving Note issued to the
Swing Line Lender shall: (i) be executed by the Borrower; (ii) be payable to the
order of such Lender and be dated on or prior to the date the first Loan
evidenced thereby is made; (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the
Swing Line Revolving Commitment of such Lender and be payable in the principal
amount of Swing Line Revolving Loans evidenced thereby; (iv) mature as to any
Swing Line Revolving Loan no later than the Maturity Date; (v) bear interest as
provided in section 2.8 in respect of Prime Rate Loans or Eurodollar Market
Index Rate Loans, as the case may be; (vi) be subject to mandatory prepayment as
provided in section 6.2; and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents.

     (d) Loan Accounts of Lenders. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with
its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
to time hereunder.

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

     (e) Loan Accounts of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
maintain accounts in which it shall record: (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Type thereof, the particular Facility under which such Loan was
made, and the Interest Period or maturity date and applicable interest rate if
such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan; (ii) the amount of any principal due and payable
or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder; and
(iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for
the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

     (f) Effect of Loan Accounts, etc. The entries made in the accounts
maintained pursuant to section 2.6(d) and (e) shall be prima facie evidence of
the existence and amounts and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay or prepay the Loans in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

     (g) Endorsements of Amounts on Notes Prior to Transfer. Each Lender will,
prior to any transfer of any of the Notes issued to it by the Borrower, endorse
on the reverse side thereof or the grid attached thereto the outstanding
principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation
or any error in any such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in
respect of such Loans.

     2.7. Voluntary Conversions of Dollar Denominated Loans; Redenomination of
Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the option to Convert on any Business Day all
or a portion at least equal to the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount of the
outstanding principal amount of its General Revolving Loans denominated in
Dollars of one Type owing by it into a Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to the
General Revolving Facility of another Type of Loans denominated in Dollars that
can be made pursuant to such Facility, provided that:

          (i) no Conversion may be made with respect to any Swing Line Revolving
     Loans;

          (ii) no partial Conversion of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall
     reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans made
     pursuant to such Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount
     applicable thereto;

          (iii) any Conversion of Eurodollar Loans into Prime Rate Loans shall
     be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such
     Eurodollar Loans;

          (iv) Prime Rate Loans may only be Converted into Eurodollar Loans if
     no Default under section 11.1(a) or Event of Default is in existence on the
     date of the Conversion unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree;

          (v) Prime Rate Loans may not be Converted into Eurodollar Loans during
     any period when such Conversion is not permitted under section 2.10; and

          (vi) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans resulting from this section 2.7
     shall conform to the requirements of section 2.2(a).

Each such Conversion shall be effected by the Borrower giving the Administrative
Agent at its Notice Office, prior to 12:00 noon (local time at such Notice
Office), at least three Business Days', in the case of Conversion into a
Eurodollar Loans (or prior to 12:00 noon (local time at such Notice Office) same
Business Day's, in the case of a Conversion into Prime Rate Loans), prior
written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing if so
requested by the Administrative Agent) (each a "Notice of Conversion"),
substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, specifying the Loans to be so
Converted, the Type

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

of Loans to be Converted into and, if to be Converted into a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any such proposed
Conversion affecting any of its Loans. For the avoidance of doubt, the
prepayment or repayment of any General Revolving Loans out of the proceeds of
other General Revolving Loans by the Borrower is not considered a Conversion of
General Revolving Loans into other General Revolving Loans.

     (b) The Borrower may, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent at
least five Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Redenomination,
request that all Loans comprising the same Borrowing, or a portion of such Loans
at least equal to the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount, by the Borrower be
Redenominated from Dollars into an Alternative Currency or from an Alternative
Currency into Dollars or another Alternative Currency; provided, however, that
after giving effect to such Redenomination, there shall be no more than an
aggregate of 8 Borrowings under the General Revolving Facility and the Swingline
Facility; and provided, further, that any Redenomination of Eurodollar Loans
shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such
Loans; and provided, still further, that no Redenomination shall be made that
would cause any Prime Rate Loans to be denominated in any currency other than
Dollars. Each such notice of request of a Redenomination (a "Notice of
Redenomination") shall be by telecopier, telex or cable (confirmed immediately
in writing if so requested by the Administrative Agent), in substantially the
form of Exhibit B-3 hereto, specifying: (i) the Loans comprising the Borrowing
to be Redenominated; (ii) the date of the proposed Redenomination (which shall
be a Business Day); (iii) the currency into which such Loans are to be
Redenominated; and (iv) if such Loans as so Redenominated are to be Eurodollar
Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for such Loans upon being so
Redenominated. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected
Lender of any such requested Redenomination. In the case of a Notice of
Redenomination that requests a Redenomination of Loans into an Alternative
Currency not described in clause (i) of the definition of the term Alternative
Currency, such Redenomination is subject to the confirmation by each Lender to
the Administrative Agent, not later than the third Business Day before the
requested date of such Redenomination that such Lender agrees to such
Redenomination, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
of such confirmation. If any affected Lender shall not have so provided to the
Administrative Agent such confirmation, the requested Redenomination will not
occur, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each
affected Lender that a Lender has not provided such confirmation and that the
requested Redenomination will not occur. If each affected Lender shall have so
provided to the Administrative Agent such confirmation or if such Notice of
Redenomination requests a Redenomination of Loans into Dollars, each Loan so
requested to be Redenominated will be Redenominated, on the date specified
therefor in such Notice of Redenomination, into an equivalent amount thereof in
the currency requested in such Notice of Redenomination, such equivalent amount
to be determined on such date by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
section 1.5, and in the case of any such Loan being so Redenominated that will
be a Eurodollar Loan, such Eurodollar Loan will have an initial Interest Period
as requested in such Notice of Redenomination.

     2.8. Interest. (a) Interest Rate for Prime Rate Loans. During such periods
as a General Revolving Loan or a Swing Line Revolving Loan is a Prime Rate Loan,
the unpaid principal amount thereof shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate
per annum that shall at all times be equal to the Prime Rate in effect from time
to time plus the Applicable Prime Rate Margin (as defined below) in effect from
time to time.

     (b) Interest Rate for Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as a General
Revolving Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, the unpaid principal amount thereof shall
bear interest at a rate per annum that shall at all times during any Interest
Period applicable thereto be the Applicable Eurodollar Margin (as defined below)
for such Eurodollar Loan plus the relevant Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period.

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

     (c) Interest Rate for Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loans. During such
periods as a Swing Line Revolving Loan is a Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loan,
the unpaid principal amount thereof shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate
that shall at all times be equal to the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin (as
defined below) plus the Eurodollar Market Index Rate plus 50 basis points.

     (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the above provisions, if an Event of
Default is in existence, all outstanding amounts of principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, all overdue interest, in respect of each Loan shall bear
interest, payable on demand, at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to 2% per
annum above the interest rate that would be applicable under section 2.8(a) to
Prime Rate Loans in effect from time to time. If any amount (other than the
principal of and interest on the Loans) payable by the Borrower under the Credit
Documents is not paid when due, all amounts outstanding shall bear interest,
payable on demand, at a fluctuating rate per annum equal 2% per annum above the
interest rate that would be applicable under section 2.8(a) to Prime Rate Loans
in effect from time to time.

     (e) Accrual and Payment of Interest. Interest shall accrue from and
including the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any prepayment
or repayment thereof and shall be payable:

          (i) in the case of any Swing Line Revolving Loan, (A) at the maturity
     date thereof, (B) on the last Business Day of each month, (C) on any
     prepayment (on the amount prepaid), and (D) after maturity (whether by
     acceleration or otherwise), on demand; and

          (ii) in the case of any General Revolving Loan, (A) that is a Prime
     Rate Loan, monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar
     month, (B) that is a Eurodollar Loan, on the last day of each Interest
     Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess
     of three months, on the dates that are successively three months after the
     commencement of such Interest Period, and (C) on any repayment, prepayment
     or Conversion (on the amount repaid, prepaid or Converted), at maturity
     (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

     (f) Computations of Interest. All computations of interest hereunder shall
be made in accordance with section 13.7(b).

     (g) Information as to Interest Rates. The Administrative Agent upon
determining the interest rate for any Borrowing shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the affected Lenders thereof. If the Administrative Agent is unable
to determine the Eurodollar Rate for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or the
Eurodollar Market Index Rate for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Market Index Rate
Loans by reference to the Telerate screen or other information provided by a
service organization referred to in clause (i) of the definition of the term
Eurodollar Rate, then each Reference Bank agrees to furnish the Administrative
Agent timely information for the purpose of determining the Eurodollar Rate for
any such Borrowing. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not timely
furnish such information, the Administrative Agent shall determine the
Eurodollar Rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining
Reference Banks.

     (h) Interest Margins. As used herein, the term "Applicable Prime Rate
Margin," as applied to any Loan that is a Prime Rate Loan, and the term
"Applicable Eurodollar Margin," as applied to any Loan that is a Eurodollar
Loan, means the particular rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with the Pricing Grid Table that appears below, based on the
Borrower's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA and such
Pricing Grid Table, and the following provisions:

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

          (i) Initially, until changed hereunder in accordance with the
     following provisions, the Applicable Prime Rate Margin will be zero basis
     points per annum and the Applicable Eurodollar Margin for General Revolving
     Loans will be 140 basis points per annum.

          (ii) Commencing with the fiscal quarter of the Borrower ended on or
     nearest to September 30, 2003, and continuing with each fiscal quarter
     thereafter, the Administrative Agent will determine the Applicable Prime
     Rate Margin for any Prime Rate Loan and the Applicable Eurodollar Margin
     for any Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loan in accordance
     with the Pricing Grid Table, based on the Borrower's ratio of (x)
     Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of the fiscal quarter, to (y)
     Consolidated EBITDA for the Testing Period ended on the last day of the
     fiscal quarter, and identified in such Pricing Grid Table. Changes in the
     Applicable Prime Rate Margin and the Applicable Eurodollar Margin based
     upon changes in such ratio shall become effective on the first day of the
     month following the receipt by the Administrative Agent pursuant to section
     9.1(a) or (b) of the financial statements of the Borrower, accompanied by
     the certificate and calculations referred to in section 9.1(c),
     demonstrating the computation of such ratio, based upon the ratio in effect
     at the end of the applicable period covered (in whole or in part) by such
     financial statements.

          (iii) Notwithstanding the above provisions, during any period when (A)
     the Borrower has failed to timely deliver its consolidated financial
     statements referred to in section 9.1(a) or (b), accompanied by the
     certificate and calculations referred to in section 9.1(c), or (B) an Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Applicable Prime Rate Margin
     and the Applicable Eurodollar Margin shall each be the highest rate per
     annum indicated therefor in the Pricing Grid Table, regardless of the
     Borrower's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA at such
     time.

          (iv) Any changes in the Applicable Prime Rate Margin or the Applicable
     Eurodollar Margin shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in
     accordance with the above provisions and the Administrative Agent will
     promptly provide notice of such determinations to the Borrower and the
     Lenders. Any such determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
     this section 2.8(h) shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

     2.9. Selection and Continuation of Interest Periods. (a) The Borrower shall
have the right

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

          (x) at the time it gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion
     in respect of the making of, or a Conversion into, General Revolving Loans
     consisting of Eurodollar Loans, to select in such Notice the Interest
     Period to be applicable to such Borrowing; and

          (y) prior to 11:00 A.M. (local time at the Notice Office) on the third
     Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a
     Borrowing of General Revolving Loans consisting of Eurodollar Loans, to
     elect by giving the Administrative Agent written or telephonic notice (in
     the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed in writing if so
     requested by the Administrative Agent) to Continue all or the Minimum
     Borrowing Amount of the principal amount of such Loans as one or more
     Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans and to select the Interest Period to be
     applicable to any such Borrowing (any such notice, a "Notice of
     Continuation"),

which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three
or six month period; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained above, the Borrower's right to select an Interest Period or to effect
any Continuation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of section 2.10
and to the following:

          (i) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans
     shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (the date of a Borrowing
     resulting from a Conversion or Continuation shall be the date of such
     Conversion or Continuation) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter
     in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next
     preceding Interest Period expires;

          (ii) if any Interest Period begins on a day for which there is no
     numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
     Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of
     such calendar month;

          (iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is
     not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
     succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest Period would
     otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the
     month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
     Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

          (iv) no Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan may be selected that
     would end after the Maturity Date;

          (v) each Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans resulting from any Continuation
     shall be in at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto; and

          (vi) no Interest Period may be elected at any time when a Default
     under section 11.1(a) or an Event of Default is then in existence unless
     the Required Lenders otherwise agree.

     (b) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period the Borrower has failed
to (or may not) elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to the respective
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans as provided above, in the case of any such
Eurodollar Loans that are denominated in Dollars, the Borrower shall be deemed
to have elected to Convert such Borrowing to Prime Rate Loans effective as of
the expiration date of such current Interest Period, and in the case of any such
Eurodollar Loans that are denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have elected effective as of the expiration date of such
current Interest Period to Redenominate such Loans from the applicable
Alternative Currency into an equivalent amount thereof in Dollars, such
equivalent amount to be determined on such date by the

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent in accordance with section 1.5, and to treat such Loans as
so Redenominated as Prime Rate Loans.

     2.10. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that (x) in the
case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) below, any Lender, shall have determined on a reasonable basis
(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto):

          (i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar
     Loans denominated in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency for any Interest
     Period, or for Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loans, as applicable, that, by
     reason of any changes arising after the Effective Date affecting the
     interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
     ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
     definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

          (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
     reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder in an amount
     that such Lender reasonably deems material with respect to any Eurodollar
     Loans (other than any increased cost or reduction in the amount received or
     receivable resulting from the imposition of or a change in the rate of
     taxes or similar charges) because of (x) any change since the Effective
     Date in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order
     or request (whether or not having the force of law), or in the
     interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of
     any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order or request
     (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve
     requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves includable in the
     Eurodollar Rate pursuant to the definition thereof) and/or (y) other
     circumstances adversely affecting the interbank Eurodollar market or the
     position of such Lender in such market; or

          (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar
     Loan denominated in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency has become
     unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any change since
     the Effective Date in any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
     order, or the interpretation or application thereof, or would conflict with
     any thereof not having the force of law but with which such Lender
     customarily complies or has become impracticable as a result of a
     contingency occurring after the Effective Date that materially adversely
     affects the interbank Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent in the
case of clause (i) above) shall (x) on or promptly following such date or time
and (y) within 10 Business Days of the date on which such event no longer exists
give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other applicable Lenders).
Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans, or for
Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loans, as applicable, shall no longer be available
in the applicable currency until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies
the Borrower and the applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of
Borrowing, Notice of Conversion or Notice of Redenomination given by the
Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans denominated in Dollars or such
Alternative Currency, or for Eurodollar Market Index Rate Loans, as applicable,
that have not yet been incurred, Converted or Redenominated shall be deemed
rescinded by the Borrower or, in the case of a Notice of Borrowing, shall, at
the option of the Borrower, be deemed Converted into a Notice of Borrowing for
Prime Rate Loans to be made on the date of Borrowing contained in such Notice of
Borrowing, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

such Lender shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender, for
such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a written
notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing the basis for
the calculation thereof, which basis must be reasonable, submitted to the
Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive
and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above,
the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in section 2.10(b) as
promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.

     (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan denominated in Dollars or in an
Alternative Currency is affected by the circumstances described in section
2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan
affected pursuant to section 2.10(a)(iii) the Borrower shall) either (i) if the
affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, by giving
the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing)
thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to
section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), cancel said Borrowing, convert the related Notice
of Borrowing into one requesting a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans or require the
affected Lender to make its requested Loan as a Prime Rate Loan, or (ii) if the
affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least one Business Day's
notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to Convert each
such Eurodollar Loan denominated in Dollars into a Prime Rate Loan or require
the affected Lender to Redenominate each such Eurodollar Loan denominated in an
Alternative Currency into a Prime Rate Loan, provided that if more than one
Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the
same pursuant to this section 2.10(b).

     (c) If any Lender shall have determined that after the Effective Date, the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy,
or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
by law with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such
Lender or its parent corporation with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank, or comparable agency, in each case made subsequent to the Effective Date,
has or would have the effect of reducing by an amount reasonably deemed by such
Lender to be material the rate of return on such Lender's or its parent
corporation's capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender's commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent
corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or its parent corporation's
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 15
days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or its parent corporation for such reduction. Each
Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be
payable pursuant to this section 2.10(c), will give prompt written notice
thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which basis must be
reasonable, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or
diminish any of the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to
this section 2.10(c) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no
Lender shall be entitled to compensation or payment or reimbursement of other
amounts under section 2.10 for any amounts incurred or accruing more than 270
days prior to the giving of notice to the Borrower of additional costs or other
amounts of the nature described in such section, and (ii) no Lender shall demand
compensation for any reduction referred to in section 2.10(c) if it shall not at
the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such
compensation, payment or reimbursement in similar circumstances under comparable
provisions of other credit agreements.

     2.11. Breakage Compensation. The Borrower shall compensate each applicable
Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth the detailed
basis for requesting and the method of calculating such compensation), for all
reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its
Eurodollar Loans) that such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other
than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent), a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of
Borrowing, Notice of Conversion or Notice of Redenomination (whether or not
rescinded or withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed rescinded or withdrawn pursuant
to section 2.10(a)); (ii) if any repayment, prepayment, Conversion,
Redenomination or Continuation of any of its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date
that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any
prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a
notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; (iv) if such Lender transfers its
Eurodollar Loans pursuant to a request by the Borrower under section 2.12(b)
hereof; or (v) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to
repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (y)
an election made pursuant to section 2.10(b). Such loss, cost, expense and
liability to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
interest rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from
the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to effect a Borrowing, Conversion,
Redenomination or Continuation, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan, over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid
were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such request within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

     2.12. Change of Lending Office; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Each Lender
agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or 2.10(c), with respect to such Lender, it will,
if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to designate another Applicable Lending Office
for any Loans or Commitment affected by such event, provided that such
designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its Applicable Lending
Office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of
avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such
section.

     (b) If any Lender requests any compensation, reimbursement or other payment
under section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or 2.10(c) with respect to such Lender, or if
any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with the
restrictions contained in section 13.4(c)), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee
(to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or
the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including any breakage
compensation under section 2.11 hereof), and (iii) in the case of any such
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation, reimbursement or other
payments required to be made under section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or 2.10(c) with
respect to such Lender, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation, reimbursement or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make
any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

     (c) Nothing in this section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in section 2.10.

     SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

     3.1. Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions
herein set forth, the Borrower may request a Letter of Credit Issuer at any time
and from time to time on or after the Closing Date and prior to the date that is
15 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date to issue, for the account of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and in support of workers' compensation,
liability insurance, releases of contract retention obligations, contract
performance guarantee requirements and other bonding and other obligations of
the Borrower or any such Subsidiary incurred in the ordinary course of its
business, and such other standby obligations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries that are acceptable to the Letter of Credit Issuer, and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, such Letter of Credit Issuer
agrees to issue from time to time, irrevocable standby letters of credit
denominated and payable in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency in such form as
may be approved by such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent
(each such letter of credit (and each Existing Letter of Credit described in
section 3.1(d)), a "Letter of Credit" and collectively, the "Letters of
Credit").

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued
the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at
such time, would exceed either (x) $30,000,000 ("Letter of Credit Sublimit"), or
(y) when added to the aggregate principal amount of all Loans then outstanding,
an amount equal to the Total Commitment at such time; (ii) no individual Letter
of Credit (other than any Existing Letter of Credit) shall be issued that has an
initial Stated Amount less than $10,000 unless such lesser Stated Amount is
acceptable to the Letter of Credit Issuer; and (iii) each Letter of Credit shall
have an expiry date (including any renewal periods) occurring not later than the
earlier of (A) one year from the date of issuance thereof, unless a longer
period is approved by the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer and Lenders (other
than any Defaulting Lender) holding a majority of the Total Commitment, and (B)
15 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, in each case on terms acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer, provided,
however, that in the case of this subclause (B), the expiry date (including any
renewal periods) may be permitted to occur beyond the Maturity Date so long as
the Borrower shall pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer an amount in
cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal to 100% of the Letter of Credit Outstandings
and such Letter of Credit Issuer shall hold such payment as security for the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrower in respect of the applicable Letter of
Credit pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Borrower (which shall permit certain investments in Cash Equivalents
satisfactory to such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower until the proceeds
are applied to the secured obligations).

     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Lender Default exists, no
Letter of Credit Issuer shall be required to issue any Letter of Credit unless
either: (i) such Letter of Credit Issuer has entered into arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Letter of Credit Issuer's
risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of the Defaulting
Lender or Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or
Lenders' Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings; or (ii) the issuance
of such Letter of Credit, taking into account the potential failure of the
Defaulting Lender or Lenders to risk participate therein, will not cause the
Letter of Credit Issuer to incur aggregate credit exposure hereunder with
respect to Loans and Letter of Credit Outstandings in excess of its Commitment,
and the Borrower has undertaken, for the benefit of such Letter of Credit
Issuer, pursuant to an instrument satisfactory in form and substance to such
Letter of Credit Issuer, not to thereafter incur Loans or Letter of Credit
Outstandings hereunder that would cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to incur
aggregate credit exposure hereunder with respect to Loans and Letter of Credit
Outstandings in excess of its Commitment.

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

     (d) Annex VI hereto contains a description of all letters of credit
outstanding on, and to continue in effect after, the Closing Date. Each such
letter of credit issued by a bank that is or becomes a Lender under this
Agreement on the Effective Date (each, an "Existing Letter of Credit") shall
constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement, issued, for
purposes of section 3.4(a), on the Closing Date, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Lenders hereby agree that, from and
after such date, the terms of this Agreement shall apply to such Letters of
Credit, superseding any other agreement theretofore applicable to them to the
extent inconsistent with the terms hereof.

     3.2. Letter of Credit Requests; Notices of Issuance. (a) Whenever it
desires that a Letter of Credit be issued, the Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer written or telephonic
notice (in the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed in writing if so
requested by the Administrative Agent) that, if in the form of written notice
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4, or transmit by electronic
communication (if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Letter of
Credit Issuer), prior to 11:00 A.M. (local time at its Notice Office) at least
three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the relevant
Letter of Credit Issuer) prior to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be
a Business Day) (each a "Letter of Credit Request"), which Letter of Credit
Request shall include such supporting documents that such Letter of Credit
Issuer customarily requires in connection therewith (including, in the case of a
Letter of Credit for an account party other than the Borrower, an application
for, and if applicable a reimbursement agreement with respect to, such Letter of
Credit). Any such documents executed in connection with the issuance of a Letter
of Credit, including the Letter of Credit itself, are herein referred to as
"Letter of Credit Documents." In the event of any inconsistency between any of
the terms or provisions of any Letter of Credit Document and the terms and
provisions of this Agreement respecting Letters of Credit, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall control. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of each Letter of Credit Request.

     (b) Each Letter of Credit Issuer shall provide to the Administrative Agent
and each other Lender a quarterly (or monthly if requested by the Administrative
Agent or any applicable Lender) summary describing each Letter of Credit issued
by such Letter of Credit Issuer and then outstanding and an identification for
the relevant period of the daily aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings
represented by Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer. Each
Letter of Credit Issuer shall, if requested by the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, provide a copy of each Letter of Credit issued by it.

     3.3. Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The Borrower hereby
agrees to reimburse (or cause any Subsidiary for whose account a Letter of
Credit was issued to reimburse) each Letter of Credit Issuer, by making payment
directly to such Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available funds at the
payment office of such Letter of Credit Issuer, for any payment or disbursement
made by such Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit (each such
amount so paid or disbursed until reimbursed, an "Unpaid Drawing") not later
than the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which such
Letter of Credit Issuer notifies the Borrower (or any such Subsidiary for whose
account such Letter of Credit was issued) of such payment or disbursement (which
notice to the Borrower (or such Subsidiary) shall be delivered reasonably
promptly after any such payment or disbursement), such payment to be made in
Dollars, with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Letter of
Credit Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (local time at
the payment office of the Letter of Credit Issuer) on the date of such payment
or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to but not
including the date such Letter of Credit Issuer is reimbursed therefor at a rate
per annum that shall be the rate then applicable to Loans that are Prime Rate
Loans (plus an additional 2% per annum if not reimbursed by the third Business
Day after the date of such payment or disbursement), any such interest also to
be payable on demand. If by 11:00 A.M. on the Business Day immediately following
notice to it of its obligation to make reimbursement in respect of an Unpaid
Drawing, the Borrower has not made such reimbursement out of its available cash
on hand or a contemporaneous Borrowing hereunder, (x) the Borrower will be
deemed to have given a Notice of

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

Borrowing for Prime Rate Loans in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to
reimburse such Unpaid Drawing (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give
notice to the Lenders of such deemed Notice of Borrowing), (y) the Lenders
shall, unless they are legally prohibited from doing so, make the Loans
contemplated by such deemed Notice of Borrowing (which Loans shall be considered
made under section 2.1 hereof), and (z) the proceeds of such Prime Rate Loans
shall be disbursed directly to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer to the
extent necessary to effect such reimbursement, with any excess proceeds to be
made available to the Borrower in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

     (b) The Borrower's obligation under this section 3.3 to reimburse, or cause
a Subsidiary to reimburse, each Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid
Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had
against such Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any other Letter
of Credit Issuer or any Lender, including, without limitation, any defense based
upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms
of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the
beneficiary of the proceeds of such drawing, provided, however that the Borrower
shall not be obligated to reimburse, or cause a Subsidiary to reimburse, a
Letter of Credit Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such Letter of Credit
Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Letter of Credit
Issuer.

     3.4. Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the issuance by
a Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit (and on the Closing Date with
respect to any Existing Letter of Credit), such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be
deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender with a Commitment, and each
such Lender (each a "Participant") shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Letter of Credit
Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation,
to the extent of such Lender's Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each
substitute letter of credit, each drawing made thereunder, the obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto (although Letter of
Credit Fees shall be payable directly to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders as provided in section 4.2 and the Participants shall
have no right to receive any portion of any fees of the nature contemplated by
section 4.3), the obligations of any Subsidiary of the Borrower under any Letter
of Credit Documents pertaining thereto, and any security for, or guaranty
pertaining to, any of the foregoing. Upon any change in the Commitments of the
Lenders pursuant to section 13.4(b), it is hereby agreed that, with respect to
all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings, there shall be an
automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this section 3.4 to
reflect the new Percentages of the assigning and assignee Lender.

     (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, a Letter of
Credit Issuer shall not have any obligation relative to the Participants other
than to determine that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter
of Credit have been delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with
the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be
taken by a Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of
Credit if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, shall not create for such Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting
liability.

     (c) In the event that a Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed (or caused any
applicable Subsidiary to reimburse) such amount in full to such Letter of Credit
Issuer pursuant to section 3.3(a), such Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and
unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter
of Credit Issuer, the amount of such Participant's Percentage of such payment in
U.S. dollars and in same day funds, provided, however, that no Participant shall
be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent its Percentage of such
unreimbursed amount for any wrongful payment made by such Letter of Credit
Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of
such Letter of Credit Issuer. If the Administrative Agent so notifies any
Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit prior to 11:00
A.M. (local time at its Notice Office) on any Business Day, such Participant
shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant
Letter of Credit Issuer such Participant's Percentage of the amount of such
payment on such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such
Participant shall not have so made its Percentage of the amount of such payment
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Letter of
Credit Issuer, such Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer, forthwith on demand such amount,
together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such
amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of
Credit Issuer at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The failure of any
Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
relevant Letter of Credit Issuer its Percentage of any payment under any Letter
of Credit shall not relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to
make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of
Credit Issuer its Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the
date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Participant to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer such other Participant's
Percentage of any such payment.

     (d) Whenever a Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for
the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer any payments from the Participants
pursuant to section 3.4(c) above, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall pay to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each
Participant that has paid its Percentage thereof, in U.S. dollars and in same
day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's Percentage of the principal
amount thereof and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the
respective participations, as and to the extent so received.

     (e) The obligations of the Participants to make payments to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Letter of Credit Issuer with
respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to
counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception
whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the
following circumstances:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
     the other Credit Documents;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off defense or other right that
     the Borrower (or any Subsidiary) may have at any time against a beneficiary
     named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any
     person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative
     Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer, any Lender, or other person, whether in
     connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
     contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying
     transaction between the Borrower (or any Subsidiary) and the beneficiary
     named in any such Letter of Credit), other than any claim that the Borrower
     (or any Subsidiary that is the account party with respect to a Letter of
     Credit) may have against any applicable Letter of Credit Issuer for gross
     negligence or willful misconduct of such Letter of Credit Issuer in making
     payment under any applicable Letter of Credit;

          (iii) any draft, certificate or other document presented under the
     Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
     in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
     respect;

          (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
     or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents: or

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

          (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

     (f) To the extent the Letter of Credit Issuer is not indemnified by the
Borrower, the Participants will reimburse and indemnify the Letter of Credit
Issuer, in proportion to their respective Percentages, for and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions,
judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature that
may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer
in performing its respective duties in any way related to or arising out of its
issuance of Letters of Credit, provided that no Participants shall be liable for
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the
Letter of Credit Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     3.5. Increased Costs. If after the Effective Date, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) by any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency (in each case made subsequent to
the Effective Date) shall either: (i) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against Letters of
Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender's participation
therein; or (ii) shall impose on such Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender any
other conditions affecting this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or such Lender's
participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the
cost to such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender of issuing, maintaining or
participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender hereunder
(other than any increased cost or reduction in the amount received or receivable
resulting from the imposition of or a change in the rate of taxes or similar
charges), then, upon demand to the Borrower by such Letter of Credit Issuer or
such Lender (a copy of which notice shall be sent by such Letter of Credit
Issuer or such Lender to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate any such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender for such
increased cost or reduction. A certificate submitted to the Borrower by any
Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender, as the case may be (a copy of which
certificate shall be sent by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender to the
Administrative Agent), setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for the
determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate any
Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender as aforesaid shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower absent manifest error, although the failure to deliver
any such certificate shall not release or diminish any of the Borrower's
obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this section 3.5. Reference is
hereby made to the provisions of sections 2.10(d) and 2.12 for certain
limitations upon the rights of a Letter of Credit Issuer or Lender under this
section.

     3.6. Guaranty of Subsidiary Letter of Credit Obligations. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally guarantees, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, the full and punctual payment of the Obligations of each
Subsidiary under each Letter of Credit Document to which such Subsidiary is now
or hereafter becomes a party. Upon failure by any such Subsidiary to pay
punctually any such amount, the Borrower shall forthwith on demand by the
Administrative Agent pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the currency
and otherwise in the manner specified in this Agreement or any applicable Letter
of Credit Document.

     (b) As a separate, additional and continuing obligation, the Borrower
unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes and agrees, for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that, should any amounts not be
recoverable from the Borrower under section 3.6(a) for any reason whatsoever
(including, without limitation, by reason of any provision of any Credit
Document or any other agreement or instrument executed in connection therewith
being or becoming void, unenforceable, or otherwise

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

invalid under any applicable law) then, notwithstanding any notice or knowledge
thereof by any Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective
Affiliates, or any other person, at any time, the Borrower as sole, original and
independent obligor, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, will make payment
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent, of all such obligations not so recoverable by way of full
indemnity, in such currency and otherwise in such manner as is provided in the
Credit Documents.

     (c) The obligations of the Borrower under this section shall be
unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing
shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by the occurrence, one
or more times, of any of the following:

          (i) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release
     in respect to any obligation of any Subsidiary under any Letter of Credit
     Document, by operation of law or otherwise;

          (ii) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement,
     any Note or any other Credit Document;

          (iii) any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or
     indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement,
     any Note or any other Credit Document or of any Subsidiary under any Letter
     of Credit Document;

          (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
     any Subsidiary or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
     similar proceeding affecting any Subsidiary or its assets or any resulting
     release or discharge of any obligation of any Subsidiary contained in any
     Letter of Credit Document;

          (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that the
     Borrower may have at any time against any Subsidiary, the Administrative
     Agent, any Lender or any other person, whether in connection herewith or
     any unrelated transactions;

          (vi) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any
     Subsidiary for any reason of any Letter of Credit Document, or any
     provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the
     payment by any Subsidiary of any Obligations in respect of any Letter of
     Credit; or

          (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any
     Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other person or any
     other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this
     section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's
     obligations under this section.

     (d) The Borrower's obligations under this section shall remain in full
force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal
of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under
the Credit Documents and by any Subsidiary under the Letter of Credit Documents
shall have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of any of the
Obligations of any Subsidiary in respect of any Letter of Credit Documents is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of such Subsidiary, the Borrower's obligations
under this section with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time
as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.

     (e) The Borrower irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand,
protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that
at any time any action be taken by any

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

person against any Subsidiary or any other person, or against any collateral or
guaranty of any other person.

     (f) The Borrower hereby subordinates all rights, whether arising by
operation of law or otherwise, that it may have upon making any payment under
this section to be subrogated to the rights of the payee against any Subsidiary
with respect to such payment or otherwise to be reimbursed, indemnified or
exonerated by any Subsidiary in respect thereof, to the indefeasible payment in
full of all of the Obligations.

     (g) In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount
payable by any Subsidiary under any Letter of Credit Document is stayed upon
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Subsidiary, all such amounts
otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any applicable Letter of
Credit Document shall nonetheless be payable by the Borrower under this section
forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.

     SECTION 4. FEES.

     4.1. Facility Fee. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent a Facility Fee ("Facility Fee"), for the account of each Non-Defaulting
Lender that has a General Revolving Commitment, for the period from and
including the Effective Date to but not including the date the Total General
Revolving Commitment has been terminated and no General Revolving Loans are
outstanding, which Facility Fee, in the case of any such Non-Defaulting Lender,
shall be computed on the amount of the Total General Revolving Commitment of
such Non-Defaulting Lender, whether used or unused, at the Applicable Facility
Fee Rate. The Facility Fee shall be due and payable in arrears on a
nonrefundable basis, on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December and on the Maturity Date, for the preceding quarter (or shorter period,
if applicable), based on a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed in such period.

     (b) As used herein, the term "Applicable Facility Fee Rate" means the
particular rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with the Pricing Grid Table that appears in section 2.8(h) hereof, based on the
Borrower's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, and the
following provisions:

          (i) Initially, until changed hereunder in accordance with the
     following provisions, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate will be 35 basis
     points per annum.

          (ii) Commencing with the fiscal quarter of the Borrower ended on or
     nearest to September 30, 2003, and continuing for each fiscal quarter
     thereafter, the Administrative Agent will determine the Applicable Facility
     Fee Rate in accordance with the Pricing Grid Table, based on the Borrower's
     ratio of (x) Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of the fiscal quarter,
     to (y) Consolidated EBITDA for the Testing Period ended on the last day of
     the fiscal quarter, and identified in such Pricing Grid Table. Changes in
     the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be made and effective as of the same
     date as is provided in section 2.8(h) in the case of the determination or
     re-determination of the Applicable Prime Rate Margin or Applicable
     Eurodollar Margin.

          (iii) Notwithstanding the above provisions, during any period when (A)
     the Borrower has failed to timely deliver its consolidated financial
     statements referred to in section 9.1(a) or (b), accompanied by the
     certificate and calculations referred to in section 9.1(c), or (B) an Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate
     shall be the highest rate per annum indicated therefor in the Pricing Grid
     Table, regardless of the Borrower's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to
     Consolidated EBITDA at such time.

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

          (iv) Any changes in the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be
     determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the above
     provisions and the Administrative Agent will promptly provide notice of
     such determinations to the Borrower and the Lenders. Any such determination
     by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this section 4.1(b) shall be
     conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

     4.2. Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of each Non-Defaulting Lender, pro rata on
the basis of its Percentage, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the
"Letter of Credit Fee"), payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day
of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date, computed
at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Eurodollar Margin then in effect
on the Stated Amount thereof for the period from the date of issuance (or any
increase in the amount, or renewal or extension) to the expiration date thereof
(including any extensions of such expiration date that may be made at the
election of the beneficiary thereof). Notwithstanding the above provisions, if
an Event of Default is in existence, the Borrower will pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, for the account of each Non-Defaulting Lender, pro rata on the
basis of its Percentage, an additional Letter of Credit Fee, computed at 2% per
annum on the Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit for the period such Default
or Event of Default is in existence.

     4.3. Facing Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay directly to each Letter of
Credit Issuer, for its own account, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit
issued by it (a "Facing Fee"), payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date,
computed at a rate of 1/8 of 1% per annum on the Stated Amount thereof for the
period from the date of issuance (or increase, renewal or extension) to the
expiration date thereof (including any extensions of such expiration date that
may be made at the election of the beneficiary thereof.

     4.4. Letter of Credit Administrative Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay
directly to each Letter of Credit Issuer upon each issuance of, drawing under,
and/or amendment, extension, renewal or transfer of, a Letter of Credit issued
by it such amount as shall at the time of such issuance, drawing, amendment,
extension, renewal or transfer be the administrative or processing charge that
such Letter of Credit Issuer customarily charges for issuances, drawings under
or amendments, extensions, renewals or transfers of, letters of credit issued by
it.

     4.5. Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent on the
Effective Date and thereafter for its own account and/or for distribution to the
Lenders such fees as heretofore agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent in the Commitment Letter dated February 19, 2003.

     4.6. Computations of Fees. All computations of Fees under this Agreement
shall be made in accordance with section 13.7(b).

     SECTION 5. REDUCTIONS AND TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.

     5.1. Voluntary Termination/Reduction of Commitments. Upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice confirmed in writing)

Commitment, provided that any partial reduction of the Unutilized Swing Line

     5.2. Mandatory Termination/Adjustments of Commitments, etc. (a) The Total
Commitment (and the Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate on March 31,
2003, unless the Closing Date has occurred on or prior to such date.

shall terminate) on the earlier of (x) the Maturity Date and (y) the date on

     (c) The Total General Revolving Commitment shall be permanently reduced,
without premium or penalty, at the time that any mandatory prepayment of General
Revolving Loans would be made pursuant to section 6.2(e), (f), (g) or (h) if
General Revolving Loans were then outstanding in the full amount of the Total
General Revolving Commitment then in effect, in an amount equal to the required
prepayment of principal of General Revolving Loans that would be required to be
made in such circumstance. Any such reduction shall apply to proportionately and
permanently reduce the General Revolving Commitment of each of the Lenders. The
Borrower will provide at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or

reduction.

     SECTION 6. PAYMENTS.

     6.1. Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay any
of its Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, from time to time
on the following terms and conditions:

Borrower so indicates that such reinvestment will take place. If at the end of
any such 12 month period any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds has not been so
reinvested, the Borrower will immediately make a prepayment of the outstanding
Swing Line Revolving Loans and General Revolving Loans as provided above in an
amount, conforming to the requirements as to amount of prepayments contained in
section 6.1, at least equal to such remaining amount.

     (f) Proceeds of Debt Incurrence. Concurrently with the receipt by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Net Debt Proceeds, the Borrower shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the amount of such Net Debt
Proceeds and make a mandatory prepayment at least equal to 100% of such Net Debt
Proceeds to be applied as a mandatory prepayment of principal of first, Swing
Line Revolving Loans and, second, after Swing Line Revolving Loans have been
paid in full, Unpaid Drawings and, third, after Unpaid Drawings have been paid
in full, General Revolving Loans.

     (g) Event of Loss. If during any fiscal year of the Company, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have received cumulative Net Cash Proceeds during such
fiscal year from one or more Events of Loss of at least $5,000,000, not later
than the fifth Business Day following the date of receipt of any Net Cash
Proceeds in excess of such amount, an amount, conforming to the requirements as
to the amount of partial prepayments contained in section 6.1, at least equal to
100% of the Net Cash Proceeds then received in excess of such amount from any
Event of Loss, shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of principal.

     (h) Material Recovery Event. Concurrently with the receipt by the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of Net Cash Proceeds in respect of any Material Recovery
Event, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of
the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds and make a mandatory prepayment at least

     (i) Change of Control. On the date of which a Change of Control occurs,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no further
Borrowings shall be made and the then outstanding principal amount of all Loans,
if any, and other Obligations, shall become due and payable and shall be prepaid
in full, together with accrued interest and Fees and the Borrower shall
contemporaneously either (i) cause all outstanding Letters of Credit to be
surrendered for cancellation (any such Letters of Credit to be replaced by
letters of credit issued by other financial institutions acceptable to the
Required General Revolving Lenders), or (ii) the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent an amount in cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal to 100% of
the Letter of Credit Outstandings and the Administrative Agent shall hold such
payment as security for the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower in respect
of Letters of Credit pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, each
Letter of Credit Issuer and the Company (which shall permit certain investments
in Cash Equivalents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, each Letter of
Credit Issuer and the Borrower until the proceeds are applied to the secured
obligations).

     (j) Particular Loans to be Prepaid. With respect to each repayment or
prepayment of Loans required by this section 6.2, the Borrower shall designate
the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant
to which such repayment or prepayment is to be made, provided that (i) the
Borrower shall first so designate all Loans that are Prime Rate Loans and
Eurodollar Loans with Interest Periods ending on the date of repayment or
prepayment prior to designating any other Eurodollar Loans for repayment or
prepayment, (ii) if the outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar Loans made
pursuant to a Borrowing is reduced below the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount
as a result of any such repayment or prepayment, then all the Loans outstanding
pursuant to such Borrowing shall be Converted into Prime Rate Loans, and (iii)
each repayment and prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be
applied pro rata among such Loans. In the absence of a designation by the
Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall,
subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion with a view,
but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under section 2.11. Any
repayment or prepayment of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this section 6.2 shall
in all events be accompanied by such compensation as is required by section
2.11.

     6.3. Method and Place of Payment. (a) Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable (based on its pro rata share) account of
the Lenders entitled thereto, not later than 11:00 A.M. (local time at the
Payment Office) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available
funds and in lawful money of the United States of America (in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars), or in the applicable Alternative Currency (in the case
of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency), at the Payment Office, it
being understood that written notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower's account at the Payment Office
shall constitute the making of such payment to the extent of such funds held in
such account. Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 11:00
A.M. (local time at the Payment Office) shall be deemed to have been made on the
next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable
rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.

     (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and Fees
then due hereunder and an Event of Default is not then in existence, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and Fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and Fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.

     6.4. Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under
any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as
provided for in section 6.4(b), all such payments will be made free and clear
of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature
now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but
excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax,
imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to
the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Lender is organized or the
jurisdiction in which the principal office or Applicable Lending Office of such
Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest,
penalties or similar liabilities with respect to such nonexcluded taxes, levies
imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges (all such nonexcluded taxes
levies, imposts, duties, fees assessments or other charges being referred to
collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower
agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes and such additional amounts as may
be necessary so that every payment by them of all amounts due hereunder or under
any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes will not
be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. If any amounts are
payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower
agrees to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender for
taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or profits of such Lender
pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in
which the principal office or Applicable Lending Office of such Lender is
located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing authority of
any such jurisdiction in which the principal office or Applicable Lending Office
of such Lender is located and for any withholding of income or similar taxes
imposed by the United States of America as such Lender shall determine are
payable by, or withheld from, such Lender in respect of such amounts so paid to
or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of
any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence, which
request shall be accompanied by a statement from such Lender setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the computations used in determining such amounts. The
Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date
the payment of any Taxes, or any withholding or deduction on account thereof, is
due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts, or other
evidence satisfactory to the relevant Lender, evidencing such payment by the
Borrower. The Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, and reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender upon its
written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid or
withheld by such Lender.

     (b) Each Lender that is a Foreign Lender agrees to provide to the Company
and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Effective Date, or in the cases
of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this
Agreement pursuant to section 13.4 (unless the respective Lender was already a
Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer and such
Lender is in compliance with the provisions of this section 6.4(b)), on the date
of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) two accurate and complete
original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or
successor forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption
from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under
this Agreement or any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the
meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such certificate, a
"Section 6.4(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or successor form)
certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United
States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under
this Agreement or any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to
time after the Effective Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances
renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material
respect, it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new
accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI, and a Section 6.4(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and
such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in
United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or
any Note, or it shall immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case
such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Certificate
pursuant to this section 6.4(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in section 6.4(a), but subject to section 13.4(g) and the immediately
succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is
required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes
imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for
the account of any Lender that is a Foreign Lender and that has not provided to
the Borrower such forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction
or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to section
6.4(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income
or similar taxes imposed by the United States or any additional amounts with
respect thereto (I) if such Lender has not provided to the Borrower the Internal
Revenue Service forms required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this
section 6.4(b) or (II) in the case of a payment other than interest, to a Lender
described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such forms do not establish a
complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this section
6.4 and except as specifically provided for in section 13.4(g), the Borrower
agrees to pay additional amounts and indemnify each Lender in the manner set
forth in section 6.4(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction
requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any Taxes deducted or
withheld by it as described in the previous sentence as a result of any changes
after the Effective Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to
the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes.

     (c) If any Lender, in its sole opinion, determines that it has finally and
irrevocably received or been granted a refund in respect of any Taxes paid as to
which indemnification has been paid by the Borrower pursuant to this section, it
shall promptly remit such refund (including any interest received in respect
thereof), net of all out-of-pocket costs and expenses; provided, that the
Borrower agrees to promptly return any such refund (plus interest) to such
Lender in the event such Lender is required to repay such refund to the relevant
taxing authority. Any such Lender shall provide the Borrower with a copy of any
notice of assessment from the relevant taxing authority (redacting any unrelated
confidential information contained therein) requiring repayment of such refund.
Nothing contained herein shall impose an obligation on any Lender to apply for
any such refund.

     6.5. Late Charges. If any principal of any Loan is not paid within 10 days
after the Administrative Agent shall have given the Borrower notice of demand
for the payment of the same or within 10 days after any Event of Default
described in section 11.1(g) in respect of the Borrower shall have occurred, or
if any interest on any Loan is not paid within 10 days after the same becomes
due, then and in any such case the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
assess a late charge, payable by the Borrower upon demand, in an amount equal to
the greater of $20.00 or 3% of the amount not timely paid. Any such late charge
shall be for the account of the Lenders for the benefit of whom such amount was
not timely paid and shall be in addition to any other amounts payable by the
Borrower under the Credit Documents.

     SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

     In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the

     8.1. Corporate Status, etc. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries: (i)
is a duly organized or formed and validly existing corporation, partnership or
limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws

limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to own its
property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and
presently proposes to engage; and (ii) has duly qualified and is authorized to

Subsidiary of the Borrower (and the direct and indirect ownership interest of
the Borrower therein).

     8.3. Corporate Power and Authority, etc. The Borrower has the corporate
power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions
of the Credit Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary
corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Credit Documents to which it is party. The Borrower has duly executed and
delivered each Credit Document to which it is party and each Credit Document to
which it is party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement or
obligation of the Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

     8.4. No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is party nor compliance with the
terms and provisions thereof: (i) will contravene any provision of any law,
statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality applicable to the Borrower or its properties and
assets; (ii) will conflict with or result in any breach of, any of the terms,
covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result
in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any
Lien upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower pursuant to the terms of
any promissory note, bond, debenture, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit
or loan agreement, or any other material agreement or other instrument, to which
the Borrower is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets are
bound or to which it may be subject; or (iii) will violate any provision of the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower.

     8.5. Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or
exemption by, any foreign or domestic governmental or public body or authority,
or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize or is required as a
condition to: (i) the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of any
Credit Document to which it is a party; or (ii) the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of any Credit Document to which the Borrower is a
party.

     8.6. Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to,
the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened with respect to the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries: (i) that have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a

any of the Credit Documents, or of any action to be taken by the Borrower

     8.7. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. (a) The proceeds of all Loans
shall be utilized in order to refinance indebtedness of the Borrower, provide
working capital and funds for capital expenditures and other general corporate
purposes, consummate Permitted Acquisitions or obtain Letters of Credit as
permitted hereunder.

     (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used directly or indirectly
to purchase or carry Margin Stock, or to extend credit to others for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock, in violation of any of the
provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System. The Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit
for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. At no time would
more than 25% of the value of the assets of the Borrower or of the Borrower and
its consolidated Subsidiaries that are subject to any "arrangement" (as such
term is used in section 221.2(g) of such Regulation U) hereunder be represented
by Margin Stock.

     8.8. Financial Statements, etc. (a) The Borrower has furnished to the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent complete and correct copies of (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the end of its fiscal year ended on or nearest to December
31, 2001, and the related audited consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, accompanied
by the unqualified report thereon of the Borrower's independent accountants;
(ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 2002 and the related unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of income and of cash flows of the Borrower
and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter or quarters then ended,
as contained in the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report of the Borrower filed with the
SEC for such fiscal quarter; and (iii) the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December
31, 2002 and the related unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income
and of cash flows of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries for the
fiscal year then ended. All such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (except as stated therein), and
fairly present the financial position of the Borrower and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates indicated and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods indicated, subject
in the case of any such financial statements that are unaudited, to normal audit
adjustments, none of which will involve a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) The Borrower has delivered or caused to be delivered to the Lenders
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement: (i) a copy of the
Borrower's Report on Form 10-K as filed (without Exhibits) with the SEC for its
fiscal year ended on or nearest to December 31, 2001, that contains a general
description of the business and affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries;
and (ii) financial projections prepared by management of the Borrower for the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal years 2003-2005 (the "Financial
Projections"). The Financial Projections were prepared on behalf of the Borrower
in good faith after taking into account the existing and historical levels of
business activity of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, known trends, including
general economic trends, and all other information, assumptions and estimates
considered by management of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to be pertinent
thereto. The Financial Projections were considered by management of the
Borrower, as of such date of preparation, to be realistically achievable;
provided, that no representation or warranty is made as to the impact of future
general economic conditions or as to whether the Borrower's projected
consolidated results as set forth in the Financial Projections will actually be
realized. No facts are known to the Borrower at the date hereof that, if
reflected in the Financial Projections, would result in a material adverse
change in the assets, liabilities, results of operations or cash flows reflected
therein.

     8.9. No Material Adverse Change. Except as reflected in the financial
statements delivered pursuant to section 8.8(a) hereof, since December 31, 2001,
there has been no change in the condition, business or affairs of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or their properties and assets

                                      -54-

considered as an entirety, except for changes, none of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

     8.10. Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has filed all federal income tax returns and all other material tax
returns, domestic and foreign, required to be filed by it and has paid all
material taxes and assessments payable by it that have become due, other than
those not yet delinquent and except for those contested in good faith. The
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has established on its books such charges,
accruals and reserves in respect of taxes, assessments, fees and other
governmental charges for all fiscal periods as are required by GAAP. The
Borrower knows of no proposed assessment for additional federal, foreign or
state taxes for any period, or of any basis therefor, that, individually or in
the aggregate, taking into account such charges, accruals and reserves in
respect thereof as the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have made, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     8.11. Title to Properties, etc. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
has good and marketable title, in the case of real property, and good title (or
valid Leaseholds, in the case of any leased property), in the case of all other
property, to all of its properties and assets free and clear of Liens other than
Liens permitted by section 10.3. The interests of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries in the properties reflected in the most recent balance sheet
referred to in section 8.8, taken as a whole, were sufficient, in the judgment
of the Borrower, as of the date of such balance sheet for purposes of the
ownership and operation of the businesses conducted by the Borrower and such
Subsidiaries.

     8.12. Lawful Operations, etc. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries:
(i) holds all necessary federal, state and local governmental licenses,
registrations, certifications, permits and authorizations necessary to conduct
its business; and (ii) is in full compliance with all material requirements
imposed by law, regulation or rule, whether federal, state or local, that are
applicable to it, its operations, or its properties and assets, including
without limitation, applicable requirements of Environmental Laws, except for
any failure to obtain and maintain in effect, or noncompliance, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     8.13. Environmental Matters. (a) The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
is in compliance with all Environmental Laws governing its business, except to
the extent that any such failure to comply (together with any resulting
penalties, fines or forfeitures) would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All licenses, permits, registrations or approvals
required for the conduct of the business of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries under any Environmental Law have been secured and the Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance therewith, except for such
licenses, permits, registrations or approvals the failure to secure or to comply
therewith is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice, or
otherwise knows, that it is in any respect in noncompliance with, breach of or
default under any applicable writ, order, judgment, injunction, or decree to
which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is a party or that would affect the
ability of the Borrower or such Subsidiary to operate any Real Property and no
event has occurred and is continuing that, with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both, would constitute noncompliance, breach of or default
thereunder, except in each such case, such noncompliance, breaches or defaults
as would not reasonably be expected to, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. There are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or
finding would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There
are no facts, circumstances, conditions or occurrences on any Real Property now
or at any time owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or on any property adjacent to any such Real Property, that are
known by the Borrower or as to which the Borrower or any such Subsidiary has
received written notice, that could reasonably be expected: (i) to form the
basis of an Environmental Claim against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Real Property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or (ii) to
cause such Real Property to be subject to any

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, use or transferability of such Real
Property under any Environmental Law, except in each such case, such
Environmental Claims or restrictions that individually or in the aggregate would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) Hazardous Materials have not at any time been: (i) generated, used,
treated or stored on, or transported to or from, any Real Property of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or (ii) released on any such Real Property,
in each case where such occurrence or event is not in compliance with
Environmental Laws and is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     8.14. Compliance with ERISA. Compliance by the Borrower with the provisions
hereof and Loans contemplated hereby will not involve any prohibited transaction
within the meaning of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. The Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries: (i) has fulfilled all obligations under minimum funding
standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan that is not a
Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan; (ii) has satisfied all
respective contribution obligations in respect of each Multiemployer Plan and
each Multiple Employer Plan; (iii) is in compliance in all material respects
with all other applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each

incurred any liability under the Title IV of ERISA to the PBGC with respect to
any Plan, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, or any trust
established thereunder, except for PBGC premiums in the ordinary course. No Plan
or trust created thereunder has been terminated, and there have been no
Reportable Events, with respect to any Plan or trust created thereunder or with
respect to any Multiple Employer Plan, which termination or Reportable Event
will or could result in the termination of such Plan or Multiple Employer Plan
and give rise to a material liability of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate in
respect thereof. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is at the date
hereof, or has been at any time within the two years preceding the date hereof,
an employer required to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan, or a "contributing sponsor" (as such term is defined in section
4001 of ERISA) in any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. Neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability with respect to
any post-retirement "welfare benefit plan" (as such term is defined in ERISA)
except as disclosed on Annex IX hereto.

     8.15. Intellectual Property, etc. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
has obtained or has the right to use all material patents, trademarks,
servicemarks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and other rights with respect to
the foregoing necessary for the present and planned future conduct of its
business, without any known conflict with the rights of others, except for such
patents, trademarks, servicemarks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights,
the loss of which, and such conflicts, that in any such case individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     8.16. Investment Company Act, etc. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to regulation with respect to the creation or incurrence
of Indebtedness under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the
Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, the Federal Power Act, as amended, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or any applicable state
public utility law.

corporate restriction, judgment, decree or order; (ii) is a party to any labor

(iii) is subject to any material strike, slow down, workout or other concerted
interruptions of operations by employees of the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
whether or not relating to any labor contracts; (iv) is subject to any
significant pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, unfair
labor practice complaint, before the National Labor Relations Board; and (v) is
subject to any significant pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened, grievance or significant

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

arbitration proceeding arising out of or under any collective bargaining
agreement; (vi) is subject to any significant pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened, significant strike, labor dispute, slowdown or
stoppage; or (vii) is, to the knowledge of the Borrower, involved or subject to
any union representation organizing or certification matter with respect to the
employees of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except (with respect to
any matter specified in any of the above clauses), for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     8.18. Existing Indebtedness. Annex III sets forth a true and complete list,
as of the date or dates set forth therein, of all Indebtedness of the Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, that: (i) has an
outstanding principal amount of at least $1,000,000, or may be incurred pursuant
to existing commitments or lines of credit; or (ii) is secured by any Lien on
any property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, and that will be outstanding on
the Closing Date after giving effect to the initial Borrowing hereunder, other
than the Indebtedness created under the Credit Documents (all such Indebtedness,
whether or not in a principal amount meeting such threshold and required to be
so listed on Annex III, herein the "Existing Indebtedness"). As and to the
extent the Administrative Agent has so requested, the Borrower has provided to
the Administrative Agent prior to the date of execution hereof true and complete
copies (or summary descriptions) of all agreements and instruments governing the
Indebtedness listed on Annex III (the "Existing Indebtedness Agreements").

     8.19. True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information (taken as a
whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower

such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf
of such person in writing to any Lender will be, true and accurate in all
material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified

information (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided, except that any such
future information consisting of financial projections prepared by management of
the Borrower is only represented herein as being based on good faith estimates
and assumptions believed by such persons to be reasonable at the time made, it
being recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future events are
not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods
covered by any such projections may differ materially from the projected
results. As of the Effective Date, there is no fact known to the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries that has, or could reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect that has not theretofore been disclosed in writing to
the Lenders.

     8.20. Insurance. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance coverage by such insurers and in such forms and amounts and against
such risks as are generally consistent with industry standards.

amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, modifying any of the
financial covenants or related provisions hereof in such manner as the Required

Administrative Agent, provided that the purpose of such Hedge Agreement is to
provide protection to the Borrower or any such Subsidiary from fluctuations and
other changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, as and to the
extent considered reasonably necessary by the Borrower, but without exposing the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries to predominantly speculative risks unrelated to the
amount of assets, Indebtedness or other liabilities intended to be subject to
coverage on a notional basis under all such Hedge Agreements.

     9.11. Most Favored Covenant Status. Should the Borrower at any time after
the Effective Date, issue or guarantee any unsecured Indebtedness denominated in
U.S. dollars for money borrowed or represented by bonds, notes, debentures or
similar securities in an aggregate amount exceeding $2,500,000, to any lender or
group of lenders acting in concert with one another, or one or more
institutional investors, pursuant to a loan agreement, credit agreement, note
purchase agreement, indenture, guaranty or other similar instrument, which
agreement, indenture, guaranty or instrument, includes affirmative or negative
business or financial covenants (or any events of default or other type of
restriction that would have the practical effect of any affirmative or negative
business or financial covenant, including, without limitation, any "put" or
mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness upon the occurrence of a "change of
control") that are applicable to the Borrower, other than those set forth herein
or in any of the other Credit Documents, the Borrower shall promptly so notify
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and, if the Administrative Agent shall
so request by written notice to the Borrower (after a determination has been
made by the Required Lenders that any of the above-referenced documents or
instruments contain any such provisions, that either individually or in the
aggregate, are more favorable to the holders of such unsecured Indebtedness than
any of the provisions set forth herein), the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders shall promptly amend this Agreement to incorporate some or all
of such provisions, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent and the
Required Lenders, into this Agreement and, to the extent necessary and
reasonably desirable to the Administrative

                                      -62-

Agent and the Required Lenders, into any of the other Credit Documents, all at
the election of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders. Except with
respect to those documents set forth on Annex X hereto, the Borrower covenants
and agrees that no later than 30 days after the date hereof, the Borrower shall
have caused any document relating to any Indebtedness that would violate the
provisions of this section 9.11 to be: (a) amended so that such document no
longer violates the provisions of this section 9.11, provided that any such
amendment shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; or (b)
terminated.

     9.12. Senior Debt. The Borrower will at all times ensure that: (a) the
claims of the Lenders in respect of the Obligations of the Borrower will not be
subordinate to, and will in all respects at least rank pari passu with, the
claims of every other senior unsecured creditor of the Borrower; and (b) any
Indebtedness subordinated in any manner to the claims of any other senior
unsecured creditor of the Borrower will be subordinated in like manner to such
claims of the Lenders.

thereafter for so long as this Agreement is in effect and until such time as the

been paid in full:

     10.1. Changes in Business. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
will engage in any business if, as a result, the general nature of the business,
taken on a consolidated basis, that would then be engaged in by the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, would be substantially changed from the business engaged in by
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof.

     10.2. Consolidation, Merger, Acquisitions, Asset Sales, etc. The Borrower

(3) make or otherwise effect any Acquisition, (4) sell or otherwise dispose of
any of its property or assets outside the ordinary course of business, or

and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders; (ii) no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom; (iii) no

     SECTION 12. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

     12.1. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
NCB as Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the other Credit
Documents, and each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes NCB as the
Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions
contained in this section 12. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other
Credit Documents, nor any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied

                                      -72-

<PAGE>

covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.
The provisions of this section 12 are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, and the Lenders, and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions
hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of
agency or trust with or for the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     12.2. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care except to the extent otherwise required by
section 12.3.

     12.3. Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates shall be: (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such person under or in connection with this Agreement (except
for its or such person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct); or (ii)
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by the Borrower or of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective officers contained in this Agreement, any other Credit
Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for any failure
of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their respective
officers to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Credit
Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made
herein or therein or made in any written or oral statement or in any financial
or other statements, instruments, reports, certificates or any other documents
in connection herewith or therewith furnished or made by the Administrative
Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or be required to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or
as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Event of Default.

     12.4. Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, facsimile transmission, telex or teletype message, statement, order or
other document or conversation believed by it, in good faith, to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation,
counsel to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected
in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or all of
the Lenders, as to any matter that, pursuant to section 13.12, can only be
effectuated with the consent of all Lenders),

                                      -73-

<PAGE>

and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Lenders.

     12.5. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

     12.6. Non-Reliance. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates have made any representations or warranties to
it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent
to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and made its own decision
to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other
conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide
any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, assets, property, financial and other conditions, prospects or
creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that may come into
the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

     12.7. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such ratably according to their respective General
Revolving Loans and Unutilized General Revolving Commitments, from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time
following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing, but only to the extent that any of the
foregoing is not paid by the Borrower, provided that no Lender shall be liable
to the Administrative Agent for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting solely from the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to
the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative
Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the
acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The
agreements in this section 12.7 shall survive the payment of all Obligations.

                                      -74-

<PAGE>

     12.8. The Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity. The Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates as though not acting as Administrative Agent hereunder. With respect
to the Loans made by it and all Obligations owing to it, the Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity.

     12.9. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign
as the Administrative Agent upon not less than 30 Business Days' notice to the
Lenders and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may be removed as the
Administrative Agent for cause upon not less than 30 Business Days' notice to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower from the Required Lenders. The
Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative
Agent for the Lenders, subject to prior approval by the Borrower if no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall include such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the resigning or removed Administrative Agent's rights, powers
and duties as the Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of
the parties to this Agreement. After the retiring or removed Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this section 12 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

     12.10. Other Agents. Any Lender identified herein as a Co-Agent,
Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent, Managing Agent, Manager or any other
corresponding title, other than "Administrative Agent," shall have no right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any
other Credit Document except those applicable to all Lenders as such. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any Lender so
identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking
any action hereunder.

<PAGE>

     (d) Without limitation of the preceding section 13.1(c), in the event of
the bankruptcy, insolvency, rehabilitation or other similar proceeding in
respect of the Borrower, the Borrower agrees to pay all costs of collection and
defense, including reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith and in
connection with any appellate proceeding or post-judgment action involved
therein, that shall be due and payable together with all required service or use
taxes.

     (e) The Borrower agrees to pay and hold the Administrative Agent and each
of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp

than to the extent attributable to any such indemnified person) to pay such
taxes.

     (f) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender,
and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, representatives,
agents and Affiliates, and the successors and assigns of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Indemnities") from and hold each of them harmless against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses reasonably incurred
by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or
by reason of:

          (i) any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not
     any Lender is a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or
     performance of any Credit Document or the use of the proceeds of any Loans
     hereunder or the consummation of any transactions contemplated in any
     Credit Document, other than any such investigation, litigation or
     proceeding arising out of transactions solely between any of the Lenders or
     the Administrative Agent, transactions solely involving the assignment by a
     Lender of all or a portion of its Loans and Commitments, or the granting of
     participations therein, as provided in this Agreement, or arising solely
     out of any examination of a Lender by any regulatory or other governmental
     authority having jurisdiction over it; or

          (ii) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials in the air,
     surface water or groundwater or on the surface or subsurface of any Real

     predecessors in interest, the release, generation, storage, transportation,
     handling or disposal of Hazardous Materials at any location, whether or not
     owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its past or current
     Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
     predecessors in interest, if the Borrower or any such Subsidiary or
     Affiliate could have or is alleged to have any responsibility in respect
     thereof, the non-compliance of any such Real Property with foreign,
     federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances (including
     applicable permits thereunder) applicable thereto, or any Environmental
     Claim asserted against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
     their respective Affiliates, in respect of any such Real Property,

including, in each case, without limitation, the reasonable documented fees and
disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the person to be indemnified or of any other
Indemnitee who is such person or an Affiliate of such person). To the extent
that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless any person set forth in
the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law
or public policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to the
payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities that is
permissible under applicable law.

     13.2. Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the maturity or the acceleration of the Loans, each Lender is

such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and
apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at
any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation, by
branches and agencies of such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit or
the account of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations and
liabilities of the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement or under any of
the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all interests in
Obligations of the Borrower purchased by such Lender pursuant to section
13.4(b), and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or
connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although
said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or
unmatured.

its rights and obligations hereunder shall be effected in accordance with
section 13.4(c).

     (b) Participations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender may at any
time grant participations in any of its rights hereunder or under any of the
Notes to (x) an Affiliate of such Lender that is a commercial bank, financial
institution or other "accredited investor" (as defined in SEC Regulation D), (y)
another Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, or (z) one or more Eligible
Transferees, provided that in the case of any such participation:

          (i) the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or
     any of the other Credit Documents, including rights of consent, approval or
     waiver (the participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
     participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such
     Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto);

          (ii) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including,
     without limitation, its Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged;

          (iii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
     hereto for the performance of such obligations;

          (iv) such Lender shall remain the holder of any Note for all purposes
     of this Agreement; and

          (v) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders
     shall continue to deal solely and directly with the selling Lender in
     connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
     and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be

                                      -77-

<PAGE>

     determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that
     the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of sections 2.10 and 2.11
     of this Agreement to the extent that such Lender would be entitled to such
     benefits if the participation had not been entered into or sold;

and, provided further, that no Lender shall transfer, grant or sell any
participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any
amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to
the extent such amendment or waiver would (x) extend any final date on or by
which any Loan in which such participant is participating may be incurred, or on
which any such Loan is scheduled to be repaid or mature, or extend any final
date on which any Commitment in which such participant is participating is
scheduled to expire or terminate, or reduce the rate of interest or Fees thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of the applicability of any post-default
increase in interest rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase
such participant's participating interest in any Commitment over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of any such
Commitment), or (y) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement.

     (c) Assignments by Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any Lender
may assign all or a fixed portion of its Loans and/or Commitment, and its rights
and obligations hereunder, to another Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, or
to an Affiliate of any Lender (including itself) that is not a Defaulting Lender
and that is a commercial bank, financial institution or other "accredited
investor" (as defined in SEC Regulation D), and (y) any Lender may assign all,
or if less than all, a fixed portion, equal to at least $5,000,000 in the
aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of its Loans and/or
Commitment and its rights and obligations hereunder, to one or more Eligible
Transferees, each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a
Lender by execution of an Assignment Agreement, provided that:

          (i) in the case of any assignment of a portion of any Loans and/or
     Commitment of a Lender, such Lender shall retain a minimum fixed portion of
     all Loans and Commitments equal to at least $5,000,000;

          (ii) the Swing Line Lender may only assign its Swing Line Revolving
     Commitment and its Swing Line Revolving Loans as an entirety and only if
     the assignee thereof is or becomes a Lender with a General Revolving
     Commitment;

          (iii) at the time of any such assignment the Lender Register shall be
     deemed modified to reflect the Commitments of such new Lender and of the
     existing Lenders;

          (iv) upon surrender of the old Notes, new Notes will be issued to such
     new Lender and to the assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity
     with the requirements of section 2.6 (with appropriate modifications) to
     the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments;

          (v) in the case of clause (y) only, the consent of the Administrative
     Agent shall be required in connection with any such assignment (which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and

          (vi) the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such
     assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a
     non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500;

and, provided further, that such transfer or assignment will not be effective
until the Assignment Agreement in respect thereof is recorded by the
Administrative Agent on the Lender Register maintained by it as provided herein.

                                      -78-

<PAGE>

     To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this section 13.4(c), the
assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to
its assigned Commitments.

     At the time of each assignment pursuant to this section 13.4(c) to a person
that is not already a Lender hereunder and that is not a United States person
(as such term is defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income
tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if
applicable a Section 6.4(b)(ii) Certificate) described in section 6.4(b). To the
extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Commitment and
related outstanding Obligations pursuant to this section 13.4(c) would, at the
time of such assignment, result in increased costs under section 2.10 from those
being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then
the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
referred to above in this sentence resulting from changes after the date of the
respective assignment).

     Nothing in this section 13.4(c) shall prevent or prohibit: (i) any Lender
that is a bank, trust company or other financial institution from pledging its
Notes or Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such
Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank; or (ii) any Lender that is a trust,
limited liability company, partnership or other investment company from pledging
its Notes or Loans to a trustee or agent for the benefit of holders of
certificates or debt securities issued by it. No such pledge, or any assignment
pursuant to or in lieu of an enforcement of such a pledge, shall relieve the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.

     (d) No SEC Registration or Blue Sky Compliance. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this section 13.4, no transfer or assignment of the interests or
obligations of any Lender hereunder or any grant of participation therein shall
be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower to
file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the
"Blue Sky" laws of any State.

     (e) Representations of Lenders. Each Lender initially party to this
Agreement hereby represents, and each person that became a Lender pursuant to an
assignment permitted by this section 13.4 will, upon its becoming party to this
Agreement, represent that it is a commercial lender, other financial institution
or other "accredited" investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) that makes or
acquires loans in the ordinary course of its business and that it will make or
acquire Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of such business,
provided that subject to the preceding sections 13.4(b) and (c), the disposition
of any promissory notes or other evidences of or interests in Indebtedness held
by such Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

     (f) Grants by Lenders to SPCs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any Lender, (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special
purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to
time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
other Lenders, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan
that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan,
the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms
hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of
the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for
any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise
be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such
indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in

                                      -79-

<PAGE>

full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any
SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting
against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State
thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
section 13.4, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written
consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any
processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans
to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity
and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding
or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer
or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such
SPC. In no event shall the Borrower be obligated to pay to an SPC that has made
a Loan any greater amount than the Borrower would have been obligated to pay
under this Agreement had the applicable Granting Lender made such Loan. This
section 13.4(f) may not be amended without the written consent of any Granting
Lender affected thereby.

     13.5. No Waiver: Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower
in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

     13.6. Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that promptly
after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect
of any Obligations, it shall distribute such payment to the Lenders (other than
any Lender that has expressly waived in writing its right to receive its pro
rata share thereof) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the
Obligations with respect to which such payment was received. As to any such
payment received by the Administrative Agent prior to 1:00 P.M. (local time at
its Payment Office) in funds that are immediately available on such day, the
Administrative Agent will use all reasonable efforts to distribute such payment
in immediately available funds on the same day to the Lenders as aforesaid.

     (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise) that is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans or Fees, of a sum that with respect to the related sum or sums
received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such
receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash
without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the
Obligations to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional
participation by all of the Lenders in such amount, provided that if all or any
portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such
purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of
such recovery, but without interest.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of the preceding sections 13.6(a) and (b) shall be subject to the
express provisions of this Agreement that

                                      -80-

<PAGE>

require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Lenders that are not
Defaulting Lenders, as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.

     13.7. Calculations: Computations. (a) The financial statements to be
furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved
(except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing
by the Borrower to the Lenders); provided, that if at any time the computations
determining compliance with section 10 utilize accounting principles different
from those utilized in the financial statements furnished to the Lenders, such
computations shall set forth in reasonable detail a description of the
differences and the effect upon such computations.

     (b) All computations of interest on Prime Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans
hereunder and all computations of Facility Fees and other Fees hereunder shall
be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

     13.8. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury
Trial. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE BORROWER HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM TO ASSERT THAT THE LAW OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER
THAN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNS THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
CREDIT DOCUMENTS. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement
or any other Credit Document may be brought in the Courts of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, or of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby
irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Borrower hereby
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its
address for notices pursuant to section 13.3, such service to become effective
30 days after such mailing or at such earlier time as may be provided under
applicable law. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any
other jurisdiction.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in section 13.8(a) above and
hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such
court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

     (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS OR OTHER MODIFICATIONS
RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING), OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED

     13.13. Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including, without

Loans.

     13.14. Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at,
to or for the account of any branch office, subsidiary or affiliate of such

section 2.12) to the extent not otherwise applicable to such Lender prior to
such transfer.

     13.15. Confidentiality. (a) The Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees
to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information (as defined
below), except that Confidential Information may be disclosed: (i) to its and
its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the
persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Confidential Information and instructed to keep such Confidential
Information confidential); (ii) to any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to any such contractual
counterparty's professional advisor, so long as such contractual counterparty
(or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
section 13.15; (iii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (iv)
to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (v) to any other party to this Agreement; (vi) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any of the other
Credit Documents, or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any of the other Credit Documents or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder; (vii) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially
the same as those of this section 13.15, to any assignee of or participant in,
or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement; (viii) with the consent of the Borrower; or
(ix) to the extent such Confidential Information (x) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this section 13.15, or (y) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower.

     (b) For the purposes of this section 13.15, "Confidential Information"
means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower and/or
its Subsidiaries or their business, other than any such information that is (i)
identified at the time of delivery as non-confidential, or (ii) available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower.

     (c) Any person required to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential
Information as provided in this section 13.15 shall be considered to have
complied with its obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same
degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information
as such person would accord to its own confidential information. The Borrower
hereby agrees that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
comply with the provisions of this section 13.15 shall not relieve the Borrower
of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents.

     13.16. Lender Register. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative
Agent to serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this section 13.16, to
retain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and
to maintain a register (the "Lender Register") on or in which it will record the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments from time to time of
each of such Lenders to the Borrower, the Loans made to the Borrower by each of
such Lenders and each repayment and prepayment in respect of the principal
amount of such Loans of each such Lender. Failure to make any such recordation,
or (absent manifest error) any error in such recordation, shall not affect the
Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the
transfer of any Commitment of such Lender and the rights to the principal of,
and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitment shall not be
effective until such transfer is recorded on the Lender Register maintained

                                      -83-

<PAGE>

by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitment and
Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with
respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitment and
Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Lender Register only
upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and
delivered Assignment Agreement pursuant to section 13.4(c). The Borrower agrees
to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature that may be imposed on,
asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its
duties under this section 13.16. The Lender Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

     13.17. General Limitation of Liability. No claim may be made by the
Borrower, any Lender or the Administrative Agent or any other person against the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or the Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, attorneys or agents of any of them, for any damages other than actual
compensatory damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other
theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, or any act, omission or
event occurring in connection therewith, and the Borrower, each Lender and the
Administrative Agent hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, waives, releases and agrees not to sue or counterclaim upon any such claim
for any special, consequential or punitive damages, whether or not accrued and
whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

     13.18. No Duty. All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, consultants and
other professional persons (including the firms or other entities on behalf of
which any such person may act) retained by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents
shall have the right to act exclusively in the interest of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and shall have no duty of disclosure,
duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any type or nature
whatsoever to the Borrower, to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any
other person, with respect to any matters within the scope of such
representation or related to their activities in connection with such
representation. The Borrower agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries,
not to assert any claim or counterclaim against any such persons with regard to
such matters, all such claims and counterclaims, now existing or hereafter
arising, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseeable, being hereby
waived, released and forever discharged.

     13.19. Lenders and Agents Not Fiduciary to Borrower, etc. The relationship
among the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, is solely that of
debtor and creditor, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no
fiduciary or other special relationship with the Borrower and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and no term or provision of any Credit Document, no
course of dealing, no written or oral communication, or other action, shall be
construed so as to deem such relationship to be other than that of debtor and
creditor.

     13.20. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties herein shall survive the making of Loans hereunder, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and any other documents the forms of which
are attached as Exhibits hereto, the issue and delivery of the Notes, any
disposition thereof by any holder thereof, and any investigation made by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other holder of any of the Notes or on
its behalf. All statements contained in any certificate or other document
delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any holder of any Notes
by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
pursuant hereto or otherwise specifically for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and warranties
by the Borrower hereunder, made as of the respective dates specified therein or,
if no date is specified, as of the respective dates furnished to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                                      -84-

<PAGE>

     13.21. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action, event, condition or
circumstance is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would
be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations or
restrictions of, another covenant, shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default
or an Event of Default if such action is taken or event, condition or
circumstance exists.

To the Administrative Agent and
   each of the Lenders (as defined below)

     Re: $100,000,000 Credit Agreement with Calgon Carbon Corporation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I am the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Calgon Carbon
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and have acted as such in
connection with (i) the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, dated as
of March 21, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, the lending
institutions named therein as lenders (the "Lenders"), and National City Bank of
Pennsylvania, as a Lender, the Swing Line Lender and as Administrative Agent
(the "Administrative Agent"), and (ii) the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit
Agreement. This Opinion Letter is delivered by me to you at the request of the
Borrower in accordance with the requirements of section 7.1(f) of the Credit
Agreement.

     I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
my satisfaction, of such documents, records and matters of law as I have
considered necessary as a basis for the opinions set forth herein, including
without limitation (i) the Credit Agreement, and (ii) the $100,000,000 aggregate
face amount of General Revolving Notes, and $10,000,000 face amount Swing Line
Revolving Note, executed and delivered by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the "Credit Documents").

     In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to
original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies and the
authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to questions of fact not
independently verified by me, I have relied, to the extent I deemed appropriate,
upon representations and certificates of officers of the Borrower, public
officials and other appropriate persons. All assumptions and statements of
reliance as to factual matters herein have been made without any independent
investigation or verification on my part, except to the extent otherwise
expressly stated, and I express no opinion with respect to the subject matter or
accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.

     My examination of matters of law in connection with the opinions expressed
herein has been limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, in each instance as existing and in effect on the date hereof and
accordingly, no opinions expressed herein shall be deemed to cover any other
laws.

<PAGE>

     I have neither examined nor requested an examination of the indices or
records of any court or governmental or other agency, authority, instrumentality
or entity, nor have I made inquiry of any person or entity, except as expressly
set forth in this Opinion Letter. In addition, I have not independently verified
or investigated the accuracy or completeness of any factual information and,
because the scope of my examination did not include such verification, I assume
no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such information.

     As used herein, "to my knowledge" shall mean to my actual knowledge.

     Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and
limitations contained in this Opinion Letter, I am of the opinion that:

          1. Corporate Status of Borrower, etc. The Borrower (i) is a validly
     existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of
     Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to own its property and
     assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and presently
     proposed to engage, and (ii) to my knowledge, is qualified and in good
     standing in each jurisdiction in which it has a facility, except in each
     instance where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

          2. Corporate Power and Authority, etc. The Borrower has the corporate
     power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and
     provisions of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and has taken all
     necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and
     performance of the Credit Documents to which it is a party.

          3. Credit Documents. The Borrower has duly executed and delivered each
     Credit Document to which it is a party and each such Credit Document to
     which it is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement or
     obligation of such the Borrower enforceable against it in accordance with
     its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be
     limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
     fraudulent transfer, moratorium or similar laws, and related judicial
     doctrines, from time to time in effect affecting creditors' rights and
     remedies generally, (ii) general principles of equity (including, without
     limitation, standards of materiality, good faith, fair dealing and
     reasonableness, equitable defenses and limits on the availability of
     equitable remedies), whether such principles are considered in a proceeding
     at law or in equity, and (iii) the qualification that certain other
     provisions of such Credit Documents may be unenforceable in whole or in
     part under the laws (including judicial decisions) of the Commonwealth of
     Pennsylvania, but the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the
     validity as against the Borrower of any of such Credit Documents as a
     whole, and such Credit Documents contain adequate provisions for enforcing
     payment of the obligations governed thereby.

          4. No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and performance by
     the Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is party nor compliance
     with the terms and provisions thereof (i) will contravene any provision of
     any United States Federal or Pennsylvania law, statute, rule, regulation,
     order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental
     instrumentality applicable to the Borrower or its properties and assets,
     (ii) will conflict with or result in any breach of, any of the terms,
     covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
     result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or
     impose) any Lien upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower
     pursuant to the terms of any promissory note, bond, debenture, indenture,
     mortgage, deed of trust, credit or loan agreement, or any other material
     agreement or other instrument, known to me after due inquiry, to which the
     Borrower is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets are
     bound or to which it may be subject, or (iii) will violate any provision of
     the articles of incorporation or by laws of the Borrower.

          5. Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
     authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with,
     or exemption by, any Pennsylvania or

<PAGE>

     United States federal governmental or public body or authority, is required
     to authorize or is required as a condition to (i) the execution, delivery
     and performance by the Borrower of any Credit Document to which it is a
     party, or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of
     any Credit Document to which the Borrower is a party.

          6. Litigation. To my knowledge, there are no actions, suits or
     proceedings pending or overtly threatened in writing with respect to the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) that have, or could reasonably be
     expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) which question the
     validity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents, or the validity
     of any action to be taken by the Borrower pursuant to any of the Credit
     Documents.

          7. Investment Company Act, etc. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
     Subsidiaries is subject to regulation with respect to the creation or
     incurrence of Indebtedness under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended, the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, the Federal Power Act, as
     amended, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or any
     applicable Pennsylvania state public utility law.

                                   **********

     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following assumptions,
qualifications and limitations:

          (1) With respect to the opinion in paragraph 4, I call your attention
     to the provisions of Section 911(b) of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code (the
     "Crimes Code"), 18 Pa.C.S. (S) 911(b), which makes it unlawful to use or
     invest income derived from a pattern of "racketeering activity" in the
     establishment or operation of any enterprise. "Racketeering activity", as
     defined in the Crimes Code, includes the collection of money or other
     property in full or partial satisfaction of a debt which arose as the
     result of the lending of money or other property at a rate of interest
     exceeding 25% per annum where not otherwise authorized by law. Accordingly,
     the opinion in paragraph 4 is qualified to the extent, if any, that the
     statute referenced in this paragraph (1) may be applicable to this
     transaction.

          (2) I express no opinion as to Section 13.2 of the Credit Agreement
     insofar as it authorizes each Lender to set off and apply any deposits at
     any time held, and any other indebtedness at any time owing, by such Lender
     to or for the account of the Borrower, and insofar as it provides that any
     Person purchasing a participation from a Lender may exercise set-off or
     similar rights with respect to such participation.

          (3) I express no opinion as to Section 6.5 of the Credit Agreement.

          (4) My opinions above are subject to the proviso that no opinion is
     given as to the application of any antitrust or securities laws.

          (5) In making my examination of documents which call for execution by
     parties other than the Borrower ("Other Parties"), I have assumed the
     enforceability thereof against all the Other Parties; and I have assumed
     that each of the Other Parties (i) has satisfied those legal requirements
     that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make the Loan
     Documents enforceable against it, and (ii) has complied with all legal
     requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights
     to enforce the Credit Documents against the Borrower.

          (6) As used in paragraph 3, the term "fraudulent transfer laws" is
     understood to include laws relating to restrictions on the ability of a
     corporation to declare or pay dividends, reacquire shares of its own stock,
     or make other distributions on or with respect to its capital stock.

<PAGE>

          (7) The opinions in this Opinion Letter are limited to the matters set
     forth herein; no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters
     expressly stated in this Opinion Letter; and the opinions must be read in

                              SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE

                              SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE

     CALGON CARBON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), hereby
certifies that the officer executing this Solvency Certificate is the Chief
Financial Officer of the Borrower and that such officer is duly authorized to
execute this Solvency Certificate, which is hereby delivered on behalf of the
Borrower pursuant to section 7.1(g) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of March
21, 2003 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement"; terms defined or referenced therein and not otherwise
defined or referenced herein being used herein as therein defined or
referenced), among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein, and National City
Bank of Pennsylvania, as Administrative Agent.

     The Borrower further certifies that such officer is generally familiar with
the properties, businesses and assets of the Borrower and has carefully reviewed
the Credit Documents and the contents of this Solvency Certificate and, in
connection herewith, has reviewed such other documentation and information and
has made such investigations and inquiries as the Borrower and such officer deem
necessary and prudent therefor. The Borrower further certifies that the
financial information and assumptions that underly and form the basis for the
representations made in this Solvency Certificate were reasonable when made and
were made in good faith and continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof.

     The Borrower will apply a portion of the proceeds from the Loans under the
Credit Agreement to retire approximately $48,736,845.35 million of other
Indebtedness of the Borrower.

     The Borrower understands that the Lenders are relying on the truth and
accuracy of this Solvency Certificate in connection with the Credit Documents.

     The Borrower hereby further certifies that:

     1. The Borrower has reviewed the Financial Projections that were prepared
on the basis of the estimates and assumptions stated therein, a copy of that
Financial Projections were furnished to the Lenders. The Financial Projections
were prepared in good faith and represent reasonable estimates of future
financial performance and are reasonable in light of the business conditions
existing on the date hereof. However, the Borrower can provide no assurances as
to the outcome of any such projections. On the date hereof, immediately before
and immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, to the
best of the Borrower's knowledge, the fair value of the property and assets of
the Borrower is greater than the total amount of liabilities (including
contingent, subordinated, absolute, fixed, matured or unmatured and liquidated
or unliquidated liabilities) of the Borrower.

     2. On the date hereof, the present fair salable value of the property and
assets of the Borrower exceeds the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of the Borrower on its debts as they become absolute and
matured.

     3. The Borrower does not currently intend or believe that it will incur
debts and liabilities that will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts and
liabilities mature.

     4. On the date hereof, the Borrower is not engaged in business or in a
transaction, and is not about to engage in business or in a transaction, for
that its property and assets would constitute unreasonably small capital.

     5. The Borrower does not intend to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors or any other person to which the Borrower is or, on or after
the date hereof, will become indebted.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower has caused this Solvency Certificate
to be executed by its Chief Financial Officer thereunto duly authorized, on
and as of this 21st day of March, 2003.
