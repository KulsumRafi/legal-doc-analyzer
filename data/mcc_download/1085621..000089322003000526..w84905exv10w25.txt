Dear Henry,

The Board of Directors and I place a high priority upon retaining your services

         -        A target bonus of 150% beginning effective beginning for

         -        A modification of your severance agreement dated September 20,
                  2001 which adds "a voluntary resignation six months after the
                  naming of any individual other than Walter Buckley as Chief
                  Executive Officer, or any individual other than yourself as
                  President or Chief Operating Officer prior to December 31,

                  and the remainder will vest monthly over next three years.
                  225,000 of these stock options cliff vest 100% after four
                  years with accelerated vesting upon achievement of specific
