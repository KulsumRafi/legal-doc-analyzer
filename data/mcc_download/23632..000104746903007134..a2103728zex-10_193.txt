        This Amendment No. 1 dated as of April 2, 2002 to Lease Agreement
("AMENDMENT NO. 1"), between HAWKEYE FUNDING, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware

liability company ("LESSEE"), amending the Original Lease referred to below.

        WHEREAS, Lessor and Lessee have heretofore entered into a Lease
Agreement dated as of November 14, 2000 (the "ORIGINAL LEASE"); and

        WHEREAS, Lessor and Lessee wish to amend the Original Lease as
hereinafter provided (the Original Lease, as amended hereby and as may hereafter
be further amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time, the
"LEASE");

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce
Lessor to amend the Original Lease, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1.   DEFINITIONS.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Original Lease.

SECTION 2.   AMENDMENTS.  The Original Lease is hereby amended as follows:

     2.1  Paragraph (c) of Section 12 of the Original Lease is amended by
          deleting such paragraph and inserting the following in its place:

               "(c) In the event the Lessee exercises its right to terminate the
          lease of the Project pursuant to this Section 12 on the last day of
          the last month of the Extended Term or on any Basic Rent Payment Date
          during any Renewal Term or in the event a termination of the lease of
          the Project occurs pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 14 hereof or
          the Lessee exercises its option under paragraph (e) of Section 13 to
          arrange for the Project to be sold and the date on which such
          termination occurs or such option is exercised is on or before the
          last day of the last month of the Extended Term or during any Renewal
          Term and the Lessee chooses to effect a sale pursuant to this
          Section 12:

               (i)    if the Cash Proceeds are greater than the Adjusted
                      Acquisition Cost, the Lessor shall pay to the Lessee the
                      amount by which such Cash Proceeds exceed the Adjusted
                      Acquisition Cost;

               (ii)   if the Cash Proceeds are equal to or less than the
                      Adjusted Acquisition Cost, but greater than or equal to
                      the percentage of the Adjusted Acquisition Cost described
                      under the heading "Column I" on Exhibit H hereto and for
                      the periods described therein, the Lessee shall pay to the
                      Lessor an amount equal to (A) the Adjusted Acquisition
                      Cost less (B) the Cash Proceeds; and

               (iii)  if the Cash Proceeds are less than the percentage of the
                      Adjusted Acquisition Cost described under the heading
                      "Column I" on Exhibit H hereto and for the periods
                      described therein (or if there are no Cash Proceeds), the
                      Lessee shall pay to the Lessor an amount equal to the sum

                                       -1-
<Page>

                      of (A) the percentage of the Adjusted Acquisition Cost
                      described under the heading "Column II" on Exhibit H
                      hereto and for the periods described therein and (B) the
                      amount, if any, by which the residual value of the Project
                      has been reduced by wear and tear in excess of that
                      attributable to normal and proper use (the amount of such
                      excess wear and tear to be such amount as the Lessor and
                      the Lessee agree, or if no agreement is reached, the
                      amount determined pursuant to the Appraisal Procedure)."

     2.2  Exhibit H to the Original Lease is amended by deleting such Exhibit
          and inserting the following Exhibit H to read in its entirety in the
          form attached hereto and made a part hereof as Annex I.

          affecting Lessee.

     3.2  The representations and warranties of Lessee contained in the Original
          Lease, after giving effect to this Amendment No. 1, are and remain
          true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of
          this Amendment No. 1 with the same effect as though such

          instrument.
