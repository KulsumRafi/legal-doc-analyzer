</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Cable Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is
intended to provide incentives which will attract, retain and motivate highly
competent persons as non-employee directors and employees of General Cable
Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and any of its subsidiary corporations, limited
liability companies or other forms of business entities now existing or
hereafter formed or acquired (&#147;Subsidiaries&#148;), by providing them opportunities
to acquire shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company
(&#147;Common Stock&#148;). Furthermore, the Plan is intended to assist in aligning the
interests of the Company&#146;s non-employee directors and employees with those of
its stockholders.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2. Administration</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan generally shall be administered by a committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;), which shall be the Board of Directors of the Company (the
&#147;Board&#148;), or, once established, a committee or subcommittee of the Board of
Directors appointed by the Board from among its members. The Committee may be
the Board&#146;s Compensation Committee. Unless the Board determines otherwise, the
Committee shall be comprised solely of not less than two members who each shall
qualify as a (i) &#147;Non-Employee Director&#148; within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;16b-3(b)(3)
(or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;an &#147;outside director&#148; within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;)
and the regulations thereunder.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is authorized, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to
establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan and to make such determinations and interpretations
and to take such action in connection with the Plan and any Stock Options (as
described in Section&nbsp;6 below) granted as it deems necessary or advisable. All
determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be binding and
conclusive on all Participants (as defined in Section&nbsp;3) and their legal
representatives. No member of the Board, no member of the Committee and no
employee of the Company shall be liable for any act or failure to act
hereunder, except in circumstances involving his or her bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct, or for any act or failure to act hereunder by
any other member or employee or by any agent to whom duties in connection with
the administration of this Plan have been delegated. The Company shall
indemnify members of the Committee and any agent of the Committee who is an
employee of the Company, against any and

any act or failure to act with respect to their duties on behalf of the Plan,
except in circumstances involving such person&#146;s bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have authority to grant Stock Options to
non-employee directors and to the executive officers of the Company (&#147;Executive
Officers&#148;). The Chief Executive Officer shall have the authority to determine
and grant Stock Options to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
are not Executive Officers and to take all necessary administrative actions
required to implement his actions under the Plan. With respect to Stock
Options proposed for groups of employees, the Chief Executive Officer shall
make recommendations to the Committee on the aggregate amount of Stock Options
and the eligible Participants and the Committee shall have the authority to
change or modify the aggregate amount of such Stock Options. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the three-year period commencing on the date the Plan is
adopted, at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock underlying Stock
Options awarded under the Plan must be awarded to employees who are not
officers or directors of the Company.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members, or to one or
more agents, such administrative duties as it may deem advisable, and the
Committee, or any person to whom it has delegated duties as aforesaid, may
employ one or more persons to render advice with respect to any responsibility
the Committee or such person may have under the Plan. The Committee may employ
such legal or other counsel, consultants and agents as it may deem desirable
for the administration of the Plan and may rely upon any opinion or computation
received from any such counsel, consultant or agent. Expenses incurred by the
Committee in the engagement of such counsel, consultant or agent shall be paid
by the Company, or the Subsidiaries or affiliate whose employees have benefited
from the Plan, as determined by the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer in
administering the Plan may obtain and rely upon opinions or computations from
counsel, consultants or agents and the Company will pay all expenses incurred
in connection with such consultations, advice or computations.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>3. Participants</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of the Plan, &#147;Participants&#148; shall mean the following
persons who are eligible to receive Stock Options under the Plan: (i)&nbsp;such
non-employee directors as the Committee in its sole discretion may designate
from time to time to receive Stock Options under the Plan, and (ii)&nbsp;certain
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are &#147;exempt employees&#148; as
defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (&#147;Exempt Employees&#148;) whom
the Committee may designate as Participants from time to time, <I>provided that </I>at
all times more than 50% of all Exempt Employees are designated as Participants.
Designation of a Participant to receive a Stock Option in any year shall not
require the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer

<P><FONT size="2">as applicable to designate
such person to receive a Stock Option in any other year or,
once designated, a Stock Option with terms identical to those of a Stock
Option as granted to the Participant in any other year. The Committee or the
Chief Executive Officer as applicable shall consider such factors as they deem
pertinent in selecting Participants and in determining the type and amount of
their respective Stock Options.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>4. Stock Option Agreements</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options shall be evidenced by agreements (which need not be
identical) in such forms as the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may
from time to time approve; <I>provided, however</I>, that in the event of any conflict
between the provisions of the Plan and any such agreements, the provisions of
the Plan shall prevail.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>5. Common Stock Available Under the Plan</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shares Available. </I>The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that
may be subject to Stock Options granted under this Plan shall be 1,500,000
shares of Common Stock, which may be authorized and unissued or treasury
shares, subject to any adjustments made in accordance with Section&nbsp;7 below.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maximum Individual Limit</I>. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock
with respect to which Stock Options may be granted to any individual
Participant under the Plan during the term of the Plan shall not exceed 250,000
shares (subject to adjustments made in accordance with Section&nbsp;7 below).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shares Underlying Stock Options That Again Become Available</I>. Any
shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option, which for any reason are
cancelled, terminated without having been exercised, forfeited, settled in cash
or delivered to the Company as part or full payment for the exercise of a Stock
Option, shall again be available for Stock Options under the Plan. The
preceding sentence shall apply only for purposes of determining the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock subject to Stock Options, but shall not apply
for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
subject to Stock Options that any individual Participant may receive.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>6. Stock Options</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>In General</I>. The Committee is authorized to grant Stock Options to
non-employee directors and key employees of the Company who are Executive
Officers and shall, in its sole discretion, determine such non-employee
directors and Executive Officers who will receive Stock Options and the number
of shares of Common Stock underlying each Stock Option. The Chief Executive
Officer is authorized to grant Stock Options to employees of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries who are not Executive Officers and shall in his
discretion determine such persons and the number

<P><FONT size="2">of shares of Common Stock underlying each Stock Option. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during the three-year period commencing on the date the Plan is
adopted, at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock underlying Stock
Options awarded under the Plan must be awarded to employees who are not
officers or directors of the Company. Stock Options must be Stock Options
which do not qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code. The Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may grant to any
Participant one or more Stock Options. Each Stock Option shall be subject to
such terms and conditions consistent with the Plan as the Committee or the
Chief Executive Officer may impose from time to time. In addition, each Stock
Option shall be subject to the following limitations set forth in this Section
6.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exercise Price</I>. Each Stock Option granted hereunder shall have such
per-share exercise price as the Committee may determine on the date of grant;
<I>provided, however</I>, that the per-share exercise price shall not be less than 100
percent of the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section&nbsp;12 below) of the Common
Stock on the date the option is granted.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Payment of Exercise Price</I>. The Stock Option exercise price may be paid
in cash or, at the discretion of the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer,
by the delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by the Participant for at
least six months, by the withholding of shares of Common Stock for which a
Stock Option is exercisable, or by a combination of these methods. At the
discretion of the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer, a payment may also
be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company
together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver
promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise
price. To facilitate the foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for
coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms. The Committee or the
Chief Executive Officer may prescribe any other method of paying the exercise
price that it determines to be consistent with applicable law and the purpose
of the Plan, including, without limitation, in lieu of the exercise of a Stock
Option by delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by a Participant for at
least six months, providing the Company with a notarized statement attesting to
the number of shares owned, where upon verification by the Company, the Company
would issue to the Participant only the number of incremental shares to which
the Participant is entitled upon exercise of the Stock Option. In determining
which methods a Participant may utilize to pay the exercise price, the
Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may consider such factors as they
determine are appropriate.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exercise Period</I>. Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be
exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as
shall be determined by the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer; <I>provided,
however</I>, that no Stock Option shall be exercisable later than ten years after
the date it is granted. All Stock Options shall terminate at such earlier
times and upon such conditions or

Executive Officer shall, in their discretion, set forth in such option
agreement on the date of grant.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>7. Adjustment Provisions</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there shall be any change in the Common Stock of the Company, through
merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, split up, spinoff, combination of shares, exchange
of shares, dividend in kind or other like change in capital structure or
distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company,
an adjustment shall be made to each outstanding Stock Option such that each
such Stock Option shall thereafter be exercisable for such securities, cash
and/or other property as would have been received in respect of the Common
Stock subject to such Stock Option had such Stock Option been exercised in full
immediately prior to such change or distribution, and such an adjustment shall
be made successively each time any such change shall occur. In addition, in
the event of any such change or distribution, in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of Participants&#146; rights under the Plan, the Committee or the Chief
Executive Officer shall have the authority to adjust, in an equitable manner,
the number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan, the number and
kind of shares subject to outstanding Stock Options, the exercise price
applicable to outstanding Stock Options, and the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Stock
Options. Appropriate adjustments may also be made by the Committee or the
Chief Executive Officer in the terms of any Stock Options under the Plan to
reflect such changes or distributions and to modify any other terms of
outstanding Stock Options on an equitable basis.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Accelerated Vesting</I>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan,
if there is a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in Section&nbsp;8(b)
below), the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer, in their discretion, may
take such actions as they deem appropriate with respect to outstanding Stock
Options, including, without limitation, accelerating the exercisability,
vesting and/or payout of such Stock Options.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Definition</I>. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;8, (i)&nbsp;if there is an
employment agreement or a change-in-control agreement between the Participant
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect, &#147;Change in Control&#148; shall
have the same definition as the definition of &#147;change in control&#148; contained in
such employment agreement or change-in-control agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;if &#147;Change in
Control&#148; is not defined in such employment agreement or change-in-control
agreement, or if there is no employment agreement or change-in-control
agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
effect, a &#147;Change in Control&#148; of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred
upon any of the following events:

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Stock Option granted under the Plan to a Participant which is subject
to restrictions on transferability and/or exercisability shall not be
transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution,
and/or shall be exercisable, during the Participant&#146;s lifetime, only by the
Participant. In the event of the death of a Participant, each Stock Option
theretofore granted to him or her shall be exercisable during such period after
his or her death as the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer shall, in
their discretion, set forth in such option on the date of grant and then only
by the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased Participant or
the person or persons to whom the deceased Participant&#146;s rights under the Stock
Option shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the discretion of the Committee or the Chief
Executive Officer, a Stock Option may permit the transferability of such Stock
Option by a Participant solely to members of the Participant&#146;s immediate family
or trusts or family partnerships for the benefit of such persons, subject to
any restriction included in the Stock Option agreement.

provisions (whether or not applicable to the Stock Option granted to any other
Participant) as the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer determines on the
date of grant to be appropriate, including, without limitation, for the
installment purchase of Common Stock under Stock Options, to assist the
Participant in financing the acquisition of Common Stock, for the forfeiture
of, or restrictions on resale or other disposition of, Common Stock acquired
under any form of Stock Option, for the acceleration of exercisability or
vesting of Stock Options in the event of a change in control of the Company,
for the payment of the value of Stock Options to Participants in the event of a
change in control of the Company, or to comply with federal and state
securities laws, or understandings or conditions as to the Participant&#146;s
employment in addition to those specifically provided for under the Plan. In
addition, except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant may defer receipt
or payment of any Stock Option granted under this Plan, in accord with the
terms any deferred compensation plan or arrangement of the Company.

Market Value shall be (i)&nbsp;the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of
calculation (or on the last preceding trading date if Common Stock was not
traded on such date) if the Common Stock is readily tradeable on a national
securities exchange or other market system or (ii)&nbsp;if the Common Stock is not
readily tradeable, the amount determined in good faith by the Committee or the
Chief Executive Officer as the fair market value of the Common Stock.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payments or distributions of Stock Options made pursuant to the Plan
shall be net of any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to applicable
federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. If the Company proposes
or is required to distribute Common Stock pursuant to the Plan, it may require
the recipient to remit to it or to the corporation that employs such recipient
an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding requirements prior to the
delivery of any certificates for such Common Stock. In lieu thereof, the
Company or the employing corporation shall have the right to withhold the
amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from such
corporation to the recipient as the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer
shall prescribe. The Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may, in their
discretion, and subject to such rules as it may adopt (including any as may be
required to satisfy applicable tax and/or non-tax regulatory requirements),
permit an optionee to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local
withholding taxes arising in connection with any Stock Option consisting of
shares of Common Stock by electing to have the Company withhold shares of
Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of tax to be
withheld, such tax calculated at rates required by statute or regulation.

under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to
its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or
a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary,
legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any person
acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such
right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of
the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general
funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and
no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except
as expressly set forth in the Plan. The Plan is not intended to be subject to
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Date; <I>provided, however, </I>that the terms and conditions applicable to any Stock
Option granted prior to such date may thereafter be amended or modified by
mutual agreement between the Company and the Participant or such other persons
