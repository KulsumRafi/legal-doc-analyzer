During the period of one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall immediately pay to any Continuing Employee whose employment in the Business is terminated by Buyer after the Closing Date without cause, the sum of fifteen percent (15%) of such terminated Continuing Employee's annual base salary, provided, however, that during the three (3) month period commencing on the Closing Date the Buyer shall not terminate the employment of, or decrease the compensation paid to, any Continuing Employee other than for cause.</P>

Seller shall pay to the Continuing Employees that portion of any such bonus that is attributable to service during such year on or before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall pay to the Continuing Employees that portion of any such bonus that is attributable to service during such year after the Closing Date in which such Continuing Employee is employed by Buyer.  In determining the amount of the bonus to be paid by Buyer in accordance with the preceding sentence, Buyer shall establish criteria under which the bonus will be paid consistent with that provided to similarly situated employees in the industry.</P>
