<PAGE>
4.2. Negotiable Collateral. In the event that any Collateral, including
proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable Collateral, and if and to
the extent that perfection or priority of Lender's security interest is
dependent on or enhanced by possession, the applicable Obligor, immediately upon

diligently prosecuted) to be registered with such appropriate filing office in a
manner sufficient to impart constructive notice of Obligor's ownership thereof,
and (iii) cause to be prepared, executed, and delivered to Lender supplemental

notify Lender whenever such separate insurance is taken out, specifying the
insurer thereunder and full particulars as to the policies evidencing the same,
and copies of such policies promptly shall be provided to Lender.

6.6. Location of Inventory and Equipment. Keep the Inventory and Equipment only

are bound, unless such payments are the subject of a Permitted Protest.

Obligor's valid existence and good standing and any rights and franchises
material to Obligors' businesses.

6.9. Environmental. Promptly provide Lender with written notice within 10 days
of the receipt of any of the following: (a) notice that an Environmental Lien
has been filed against any


                                       16
<PAGE>
of the real or personal property of any Obligor and (b) commencement of any
Environmental Action or notice that an Environmental Action will be filed
against any Obligor.

7. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

         Each Obligor covenants and agrees that, so long and until full and
final payment of the Obligations, Obligors will not and will not permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries to do any of the following:

7.1. Change Name. Change any Obligor's name, FEIN, corporate structure or
identity, or add any new fictitious name; provided, however, that a Obligor may
change its name upon at least 30 days prior written notice by Parent to Lender
of such change and so long as, at the time of such written notification, such
Obligor provides any financing statements or fixture filings necessary to
perfect and continue perfected Lender's Liens.

7.2. Change in Location of Chief Executive Office; Inventory and Equipment with
Bailees. Relocate its chief executive office to a new location without Parent
providing 30 days prior written notification thereof to Lender and so long as,
at the time of such written notification, the applicable Obligor provides any
financing statements or fixture filings necessary to perfect and continue
perfected the Lender's Liens and also provides to Lender a Collateral Access
Agreement with respect to such new location. The Inventory and Equipment shall
not at any time now or hereafter be stored with a bailee, warehouseman, or
similar party without Lender's prior written consent.

7.3. Securities Accounts. Establish or maintain any Securities Account unless
Lender shall have received a Control Agreement in respect of such Securities
Account (in the case of the DDAs, within the time period referred to in Section
6.1(c)). Obligors agree to not transfer assets out of any Securities Account;
provided, however, that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or would result therefrom, Obligors may use such assets (and the
proceeds thereof) to the extent not prohibited by this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.

8. SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT.

         The rights and obligations of the Lender and each Obligor under this
Agreement are subject in all respects to the provisions of the Subordination
Agreement.

9. THE LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

9.1. Rights and Remedies. Subject to the provisions of the Subordination
Agreement, upon the occurrence, and during the continuation, of an Event of
Default, Lender (at its election but without notice of its election and without
demand) may do any one or more of the following, all of which are authorized by
Obligors:

         (a) Cause Obligors to hold all returned Inventory in trust for Lender,
segregate all returned Inventory from all other assets of Obligors or in
Obligors' possession and conspicuously label said returned Inventory as the
property of Lender;


                                       17
<PAGE>
         (b) Without notice to or demand upon any Obligor make such payments and
do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to protect its security
interests in the Collateral. Each Obligor agrees to assemble the Personal
Property Collateral if Lender so requires, and to make the Personal Property
Collateral available to Lender at a place that Lender may designate which is
reasonably convenient to both parties. Each Obligor authorizes Lender to enter
the premises where the Personal Property Collateral is located, to take and
maintain possession of the Personal Property Collateral, or any part of it, and
to pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any Lien that in Lender's determination
appears to conflict with the Lender's Liens and to pay all expenses incurred in
connection therewith. With respect to any of Obligors' owned or leased premises,
each Obligor hereby grants Lender a license to enter into possession of such
premises and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to exercise any of the
Lender's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

         (c) Without notice to any Obligor (such notice being expressly waived),
and without constituting a retention of any collateral in satisfaction of an
obligation (within the meaning of the Code), set off and apply to the
Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of any Obligor held by Lender
or (ii) Indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit or the account of
any Obligor held by Lender;

         (d) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits of any
Obligor held the Lender to secure the full and final repayment of all of the
Obligations;

         (e) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare
for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided for herein) the
Personal Property Collateral. Each Obligor hereby grants to Lender a license or
other right to use, without charge, such Obligor's labels, patents, copyrights,
trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter,
or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the Personal Property
Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any
Personal Property Collateral and such Obligor's rights under all licenses and
all franchise agreements shall inure to Lender's benefit;

         (f) Sell the Personal Property Collateral at either a public or private
sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash or on
terms, in such manner and at such places (including Obligors' premises) as
Lender determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the
Personal Property Collateral be present at any such sale;

         (g) Lender shall give notice of the disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as follows:

                           (i) Lender shall give Parent (for the benefit of the
         applicable Obligor) a notice in writing of the time and place of public
         sale, or, if the sale is a private sale or some other disposition other
         than a public sale is to be made of the Personal Property Collateral,
         the time on or after which the private sale or other disposition is to
         be made; and

                           (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered or
         mailed, postage prepaid, to Parent as provided in section 8.2 of
         Amendment No. 3, at least 10 days before


                                       18
<PAGE>
         the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no notice
         needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the
         Personal Property Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline
         speedily in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized
         market;

         (h) Lender may credit bid and purchase at any public sale;

         (i) Lender may seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take
possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate same and, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of such a receiver
without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

         (j) Lender shall have all other rights and remedies available to it at
law or in equity pursuant to any other Loan Documents; and

         (k) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by Obligors. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Lender to Parent (for the benefit of the applicable Obligor).

9.2. Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies of Lender under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall be
cumulative. Lender shall have all other rights and remedies not inconsistent
herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender
of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by Lender of
any Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by Lender
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

10. TAXES AND EXPENSES.

         If any Obligor fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, assessments,
insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased properties or assets, rents or
other amounts payable under such leases) due to third Persons, or fails to make
any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all as
required under the terms of this Agreement, then, Lender, in its sole discretion
and without prior notice to any Obligor, may do any or all of the following: (a)
make payment of the same or any part thereof, (b) or in the case of the failure
to comply with Section 6.5 hereof, obtain and maintain insurance policies of the
type referred to in Section 6.5 and take any action with respect to such
policies as Lender deems prudent. Any such amounts paid by Lender shall
constitute Lender Expenses and any such payments shall not constitute an
agreement by Lender to make similar payments in the future or a waiver by Lender
of any Event of Default. Lender need not inquire as to, or contest the validity
of, any such expense, tax, or Lien and the receipt of the usual official notice
for the payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the same was validly
due and owing.

11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1. Demand; Protest; etc. Each Obligor waives demand, protest, notice of
protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment,
nonpayment at maturity, release,


                                       19
<PAGE>
compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of documents, instruments, chattel
paper, and guarantees at any time held by Lender on which any such Obligor may
in any way be liable.

11.2. Lender's Liability for Collateral. Each Obligor hereby agrees that: (a) so
long as Lender complies with its obligations, if any, under the Code, Lender
shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for: (i) the safekeeping
of the Collateral, (ii) any loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any
manner or fashion from any cause, (iii) any diminution in the value thereof, or
(iv) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency,
or other Person, and (b) all risk of loss, damage, or destruction of the
Collateral shall be borne by Obligors.

11.3. Indemnification. The provisions of article 7 of the Purchase Agreement
shall apply to this Agreement as if this Agreement has been executed
contemporaneously with the Purchase Agreement, and references therein to a
"Transaction Document" shall include a reference to this Agreement.

12. NOTICES.

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices or demands by Obligors
or Lender to the other relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be given in accordance with section 8.2 of Amendment No. 3.

13. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.

13.1. GOVERNING LAW. THE VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONSTRUCTION,
INTERPRETATION, AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES HERETO
WITH RESPECT TO ALL MATTERS ARISING HEREUNDER OR RELATED HERETO SHALL BE
DETERMINED UNDER, GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

13.2. NEW YORK COURTS. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED AND LITIGATED ONLY IN THE STATE
AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, COUNTY OF NEW YORK,
STATE OF NEW YORK, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUIT SEEKING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST
ANY COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE BROUGHT, AT LENDER'S OPTION, IN THE
COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION WHERE LENDER ELECTS TO BRING SUCH ACTION OR WHERE
SUCH COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE FOUND. OBLIGORS AND LENDER WAIVE, TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO ASSERT THE
DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE EXTENT ANY
PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 13.2.

13.3. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. OBLIGORS AND LENDER HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE


                                       20
<PAGE>
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH
OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW OR STATUTORY CLAIMS. OBLIGORS AND
LENDER REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER AND EACH KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A
WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

14. ASSIGNMENTS AND SUCCESSORS.

         This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided, however, that Obligors
may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder without the
Lender's prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall be absolutely
void ab initio. No consent to assignment by the Lender shall release any Obligor
from its Obligations. Lender may assign this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and thereunder in accordance with
the Purchase Agreement and, except as expressly required pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, no consent or approval by any Obligor is required in
connection with any such assignment.

15. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.

15.1. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, and no consent with respect to any departure by Obligors therefrom,
shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Lender and
Parent (on behalf of all Obligors) and then any such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given.

15.2. No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by Lender to exercise any
right, remedy, or option under this Agreement, or delay by Lender in exercising
the same, will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by Lender will be
effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically
stated. No waiver by Lender on any occasion shall affect or diminish Lender's
rights thereafter to require strict performance by Obligors of any provision of
this Agreement. Lender's rights under this Agreement will be cumulative and not
exclusive of any other right or remedy that Lender may have.

16. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

16.1. Effectiveness. This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when
executed by Obligors and Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature
pages hereof.

16.2. Section Headings. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for
convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything
contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.

16.3. Interpretation. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity
herein shall be construed or resolved against Lender or Obligors, whether under
any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been
reviewed by all parties and shall be


                                       21
<PAGE>
construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so
as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.

16.4. Severability of Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement shall be
severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of
determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

16.5. Amendments in Writing. This Agreement only can be amended by a writing in
accordance with Section 15.1.

16.6. Counterparts; Telefacsimile Execution. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts,
each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of
this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed
counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of
this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis
mutandis.

16.7. Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations. If the incurrence or payment of
the Obligations by any Obligor or the transfer to Lender of any property should
for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state
or federal law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other
voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property
(collectively, a "Voidable Transfer"), and if Lender is required to repay or
restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so
upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable
Transfer, or the amount thereof that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of Lender
related thereto, the liability of Obligors automatically shall be revived,
reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had
never been made.

16.8. Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents,
reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by
any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.

16.9. Parent as Agent for Obligors. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably appoints
Parent as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Obligors which
appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until prior written
notice signed by each Obligor that such appointment has been revoked and that
another Obligor has been appointed Parent.
