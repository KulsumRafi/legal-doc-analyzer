                 FISCAL YEAR 2003 BIOMEASUREMENT DIVISION BONUS PLAN
                      OF HUTCHINSON TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED


Hutchinson  Technology  Incorporated  ("HTI")  has a bonus  plan that  covers an
executive   officer  and  certain  other   management-level   employees  of  its
BioMeasurement Division. The decision to pay out bonuses is made annually by the
Compensation Committee of HTI's Board of Directors.  The Committee's decision is
based  primarily  on  the  BioMeasurement  Division's  attainment  of an  annual
earnings per share goal for the fiscal year,  as well as other  factors that may
be considered  at the  Committee's  discretion.  Bonuses are paid in cash in the
first quarter of the following fiscal year.
