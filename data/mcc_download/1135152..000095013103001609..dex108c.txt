                                 First Amendment
                                       of
               FMC Technologies, Inc. Savings and Investment Plan

     WHEREAS, FMC Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") maintains the FMC
Technologies, Inc. Savings and Investment Plan (the "Plan"); and

     WHEREAS, since its spin-off from FMC Corporation, the Company has allowed
participants in the Plan to continue to hold or sell balances in the FMC
Corporation Stock Fund in the participants' discretion, but has prohibited new
investments in the FMC Corporation Stock Fund;

     WHEREAS, the Company now deems necessary and desirable to amend the Plan to
eliminate the FMC Corporation Stock Fund from the investment options offered
under the Plan; and

     NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority reserved to the Company by
Section 10.3 of the Plan, the Plan is hereby amended effective as of July 1,
2003, as follows:

     Section 10.3.3. Investment of Accounts is here by amended by adding the
     following to the end thereof:

          "Effective July 1, 2003 the FMC Stock Fund will be eliminated as an
          Investment Fund in the Plan. The Company will direct the Trustee to
          sell any balances remaining in the FMC Corporation Stock Fund on June
          30, 2003 and reinvest the proceeds from such sale into another
          Investment Fund under the Plan to be designated by the Company at the
          time. It is currently anticipated that any remaining balances in the
          FMC Corporation Stock Fund will be transferred to the Fidelity
          Retirement Government Money Market Portfolio."

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned officer has executed the foregoing
amendment on behalf of the Company, this 13/th/ day of August 2002.

                                            FMC Technologies, Inc.
