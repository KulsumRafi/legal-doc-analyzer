Further, the waiver by either party of a particular breach of this Agreement by the other shall neither be construed as nor constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or of other breaches by the same or any other provision of this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.3&#9;<B>Severability.</B> If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator finds any provision of this Agreement be unenforceable, the provision shall be deemed amended as necessary to conform to applicable laws or regulations, or if it cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the parties, the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if the offending provision were not contained herein.</P>
