modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Internal Revenue
Code.

          (c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable laws, including ERISA
and the Internal Revenue Code (including the prohibited transaction rules
thereunder), and contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the

if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the Balance Sheet. No suit,

claims) and there is no pending audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service
or United States Department of Labor with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

Plan.

          (d) Each Company Benefit Plan can be amended, discontinued or
terminated at any time in accordance with its terms, without liability (other
than (A) liability for ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a
termination event or (B) liabilities for which sufficient assets are set aside
in a trust or insurance contract to satisfy such liability or which are
reflected on the Balance Sheet).

          (e) Each Company Benefit Plan and its related trust that is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) or 4975(e)(7) and Section 501(a), respectively,
of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to such qualified status or has been established under a standardized
prototype plan for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion letter has been
obtained by the plan sponsor and was valid when issued as to the adopting
employer.

          (f) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or other pension plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA or the minimum funding rules of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code and no
Company ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or been required to
contribute to any such pension plan.

          (g) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan required to be set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or the
minimum funding rules of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, (i) no reportable
event (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than an event that is
not required to be reported before or within thirty (30) days of such event) has
occurred or is expected to occur, (ii) there was not an accumulated funding
deficiency (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code), whether or not waived, as of the most recently ended
plan year of such Company Benefit Plan; and (iii) there is no "unfunded benefit
liability" (within the meaning of Section 4001 (a) (18) of ERISA). No material
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any other
Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to Company of incurring or being subject
(whether primarily, jointly or secondarily) to a material liability thereunder.
The assets of the Company are not the subject of any lien arising under ERISA or
Section 412(n) of the Internal Revenue Code.

          (h) Except as required by law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any of
the following retiree or post-employment benefits to any person: medical,

correct copies of (i) all consulting agreements of the Company providing for
total annual compensation (including all salary and bonuses) in excess of one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and all employment agreements with officers,
(ii) all severance plans, agreements, programs and policies of the Company with
or relating to their respective employees, directors or consultants, and (iii)
all plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company with or
relating to its employees, directors or consultants which contain "change of
control" provisions. The consummation of the Transactions will not, alone or in
conjunction with any other possible event (including termination of employment)
(i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of the
Company to severance benefits or any other payment, compensation or benefit
(including forgiveness of indebtedness), except as expressly provided by this
Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation or benefit due any such employee or service provider,
alone or in conjunction with any other possible event (including termination of
employment).

          (j) The execution of this Agreement, and performance of the
Transactions, will not (either along with or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company Benefit
Plan or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any payment
(whether severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, vesting or increase in
benefits with respect to any employee, former employee or director of the
Company whether or not any such payment would be an "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code).

          (a) The Company has duly and timely filed all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed, and has duly and timely paid or caused to be duly paid in

and complete in all material respects and accurately reflect all liability for
Taxes for the periods covered thereby. All material unpaid Taxes owed by the

Date (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) are reflected on the Financial
Statements. Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not incurred any

administrative proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company.

claimed or raised by any taxing authority in writing.

          (d) The Company is not a party to any agreement, plan, contract or

     3.15 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ENCUMBRANCES. The Company has good, valid and
marketable title to all the material properties and assets which it purports to
own (real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible) and which are reflected

the Company since the date of the Balance Sheet, in each case free and clear of
all mortgages, title defects or objections, liens, claims, charges, security

respects with all Environmental Laws, including compliance with any permits or
other governmental authorizations or the terms and conditions thereof, (b) the

Agreement are currently in compliance in all material respects with all legal
requirements (including the timely post-registration filing of affidavits of use

          (d) TRADE SECRETS. The Company has taken reasonable steps in
accordance with normal industry practice to protect its rights in the Company's
confidential information and its Trade Secrets, the secrecy of which is material
to the currently conducted and currently contemplated business of the Company.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company generally enforces
a policy of requiring each relevant employee, consultant and contractor to
execute agreements that contain provisions designed to prevent unauthorized
disclosure of the Trade Secrets and all other confidential Intellectual Property
of the Company. With respect to employees, such agreements assign to the Company
all rights to any Intellectual Property relating to the Company's business that
is developed by the employee in the course of his or her activities as an
employee of the Company. With respect to contractors and consultants, the
agreements either assign all Intellectual Property rights developed pursuant to
the agreement, which the Company determined at the time was material to its
business or license such rights on agreed upon terms. Except under
confidentiality obligations, to the Company's knowledge, there has been no
disclosure by the Company, or any of its employees, consultants, or contractors

Company.

knowledge, threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any Inbound
License Agreement or any Outbound License Agreement.

          (f) OWNERSHIP. The Company owns or possesses adequate licenses or
other rights to use, free and clear of Liens, orders and arbitration awards, all
its material Intellectual Property used in its business, as it is currently
conducted and currently contemplated in the field of ribozymes, ribozyme
diagnostics, RNA interference (RNAi) involving small interfering nucleic acid
(siNA, including siRNA) molecules, and process development/cGMP manufacturing of
RNA and siNA, including siRNA. The Intellectual Property identified in Section
3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with the Company's Trade
Secrets, unregistered copyrights, and the Company's rights under the licenses
granted to the Company under the Inbound License Agreements and any other
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or to which the Company has a license
or other right to use, constitute all the material Intellectual Property rights
used in the operation of the Company's business as it is currently conducted and
currently contemplated in the field of ribozymes, ribozyme diagnostics, RNAi
involving small interfering nucleic acid (siNA, including siRNA) and process
development/cGMP manufacturing of RNA and siNA, including siRNA and, to the
Company's knowledge, are all the Intellectual Property rights the Company is
likely to utilize to operate such business after the Closing in substantially
the same manner as such business (in the field of ribozymes, ribozyme
diagnostics, RNAi involving small interfering nucleic acid (siNA, including
siRNA) and process development/cGMP manufacturing of RNA and siNA, including
siRNA) has been operated by the Company prior thereto.

          (g) PROTECTION OF IP. The Company has taken reasonable steps to
protect the material Intellectual Property of the Company.

          (h) NO INFRINGEMENT BY THE COMPANY. To the Company's knowledge, none
of the products manufactured, marketed, used, sold or licensed by the Company
involving ribozymes, ribozyme diagnostics, RNAi involving small interfering
nucleic acid (siNA, including siRNA) and process development/cGMP manufacturing
of RNA and siNA, including siRNA and none of the Intellectual Property used by
the Company in the conduct of the Company's businesses as currently conducted
and currently contemplated in the field of ribozymes, ribozyme diagnostics, RNAi
involving small interfering nucleic acid (siNA, including siRNA) and process
development/cGMP manufacturing of RNA and siNA, including siRNA infringes upon,
violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of any valid and enforceable rights
owned or controlled by any third party.

          (i) NO PENDING OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. No litigation to
which the Company is a party is now pending and, to the Company's knowledge, no
notice or other claim in writing has been received by the Company within the one
(1) year prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) alleging that the Company has
engaged in any activity or conduct that infringes upon, violates or constitutes
the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party or
(ii) challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to or by the Company. To
the Company's knowledge, no Intellectual Property (y) that is owned by the
Company is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or
agreement materially restricting the use, sale, transfer, assignment or
licensing thereof by the Company, except as may be specifically provided in any
such Outbound License Agreement or other Licenses, or (z) that is the subject of
an Inbound License Agreement is, to the knowledge of the Company, subject to any
outstanding judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement materially restricting
the use, sale, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by the Company, except
as provided in the Inbound License Agreements or other Licenses.

          (j) NO INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES. To the Company's knowledge, no
third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any
Intellectual Property owned or licensed by the Company. No such claims have been
brought against any third party by the Company

          (k) ASSIGNMENT; CHANGE OF CONTROL. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
Transactions, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any
right of any third party to terminate or materially alter, any of the Company's
material rights to own any of its Intellectual Property or its material rights
under any Inbound License Agreement or Outbound License Agreement, nor require
the consent of any Governmental Authority or third party in respect of any such
Intellectual Property.

     3.19 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

          (a) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
currently applicable laws and regulations respecting employment, discrimination
in employment, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours and occupational

labor practice. The Company has withheld all amounts required by law or by
agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to
employees, and the Company is not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes
or any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. The Company is

administrative authority, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits,
social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than

workers compensation plan or policy or (ii) for long-term disability benefits.

Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor
union contract. To the Company's knowledge, no employees of the Company are in

agreement, noncompetition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the
Company because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to
be conducted by the Company or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary
information of others. No employee of the Company has given written notice to
the Company, and the Company is not otherwise aware, that any such employee
intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company.

          (b) Section 3.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the name,

     3.24 RIGHTS AGREEMENT; DELAWARE 203 APPROVAL. The Company has taken all
action necessary under the Rights Agreement, so that the execution of this
Agreement and any amendments thereto by the parties hereto and the consummation
of each of the Transactions shall not cause a Distribution Date, a Stock
Acquisition Date or a Flip-in Event or Flip-over Event (as such terms are
defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur. Prior to the date of this Agreement,
the Company's board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (a)
determined that the Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company, (b)
approved the Transactions, and (c) resolved to recommend that the stockholders
of the Company approve the Transactions. The action taken by the Company's board
of directors constitutes approval of the Transactions under the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL such that Section 203 of the DGCL does not apply to this
Agreement or the Transactions, and such approval has not been amended, rescinded
or modified. No other state takeover, antitakeover, moratorium, fair price,
interested stockholder, business combination or similar statute or rule is
applicable to the Transactions. If any state takeover statute other than Section
203 of the DGCL becomes or is deemed to become applicable to this Agreement or
the Transactions, the Company shall take all reasonable action necessary to
render such statute inapplicable to all of the foregoing. On or prior to the
date of this Agreement, (i) each of the Resigning Directors has submitted

respective predecessors (the "Board Consent"), a copy of each such resignation
and the Board Consent having been delivered to the Investors and their counsel.

     3.25 ABSENCE OF QUESTIONABLE PAYMENTS. Neither the Company, nor to the
Company's knowledge, any director, officer, agent, employee or other Person
acting on behalf of the Company has used any corporate or other funds for any
unlawful contribution, payment, gift, or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditure relating to political activity to government officials or others or
established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of
Section 30A of the Exchange Act. Neither the Company, nor to the Company's
knowledge, any current director, officer, agent, employee or other Person acting
on behalf of the Company, has accepted or received any unlawful contribution,
payment, gift or expenditure. The Company is in compliance with the provisions
of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act.

     3.26 INSIDER INTERESTS; RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS. Except for inventors

knowledge no executive officer or director of the Company has any material
interest in any material property, real or personal, tangible or intangible,
including any invention, patent, trademark or trade name, used in or pertaining
to the business of the Company. Section 3.26 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, complete and correct list, as of the date hereof, of any
transaction, arrangement or relationship involving an amount of $50,000 or more
that any director, officer or other affiliate of the Company has or has had in
the last three (3) years, directly or indirectly relating to, (i) an economic
interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit from, any person that
has furnished or sold, or furnishes or sells, services or products that the
Company furnishes or sells, or proposes to furnish or sell, or (ii) an economic
interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit from, any person that
purchases from or sells or furnishes to, the Company, any goods or services;
provided, however, that ownership of no more than one percent (1%) of the
outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation shall not be deemed an
"economic interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit from, any
person" for purposes of this Section 3.26.

     3.27 BROKERS OR FINDERS. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any brokers' or
finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee payable by the Company in
connection with any of the Transactions except for amounts paid or payable to
the Financial Advisor. The Company has no liabilities or obligations (absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) to the Financial Advisor except as set forth
in the amended and restated engagement letter between the Company and the
Financial Advisor, which letter is included in Section 3.27 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

     3.28 NOT AN INVESTMENT COMPANY. The Company is not, and after giving effect
to, but only giving effect to, the offering and sale of the Common Shares and
Warrants (including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(ii)) (without consideration to the application of the proceeds, other
than to the extent such proceeds are used for internal research and development,
working capital or operating expenses) will not be required to register as an
"investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

     3.29 INSURANCE. The Company is insured by insurance providers that, to the
Company's knowledge, are financially sound and reputable. The Company is insured
by such providers with policies in such amounts and with such deductibles and
covering such risks as are generally deemed adequate and customary for the
business of the Company, including worker's compensation insurance, directors'
and officers' liability insurance and policies covering real and personal
property owned or leased by the Company against loss, theft, damage,
destruction, acts of vandalism fire and earthquakes and general liability. The
Company believes that it will be able to renew its existing insurance coverage
as and when such policies expire or to obtain comparable coverage from similar
institutions as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as now
conducted and at a cost that would not result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has not been denied any insurance coverage which it has
sought or for which it has applied. The Company does not have any liability for
which any claim may be made against the Company's insurance policies and, to the
Company's knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred which is likely to
result in such claim.

     3.30 COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Investors set forth in Section 4 hereof,
the offer and sale by the Company of the Common Shares and any Warrants
(including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii))
contemplated hereunder is exempt from (i) the registration and prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act and (ii) the registration
requirements of all applicable state securities and "blue sky" laws. The Company
has not issued, offered or sold any shares of Common Stock (including for this
purpose any securities of the same or a similar class as the Common Stock or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the Common Stock)
within the six (6) month period preceding the date hereof or taken any other
action, or failed to take any action, that, in any such case, would (i)
eliminate the availability of the exemption from registration under Regulation D
under the Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale of the Common
Shares as contemplated hereby or (ii) cause the offering of the Common Shares
pursuant to this Agreement to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company
for purposes of the Securities Act. The Company shall not directly or indirectly
take, and shall not permit any of its directors, or officers indirectly to take,
any action (including any offering or sale to any person or entity of the Common
Shares or any Common Stock) that will make unavailable the exemption from
registration under the Securities Act being relied upon by the Company for the
offer and sale to the Investors of the Common Shares as contemplated by this
Agreement, including the filing of a registration statement under the Securities
Act. No form of general solicitation or advertising within the meaning of Rule
502(c) under the Securities Act has been used or authorized by the Company or
any of its officers or directors in connection with the offer or sale of the
Common Shares or the Warrants (including the additional warrants to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)) as contemplated by this Agreement or any other
agreement to which the Company is a party.

     3.31 NO MANIPULATION OF STOCK. The Company has not taken, nor will take, in
violation of applicable law, any action designed to or that might reasonably be
expected to cause or result in unlawful manipulation of the price of the Common
Stock, including to facilitate the sale or resale of the Common Shares.

     3.32 OFFERING MATERIALS. The Company has not distributed and the Company
will not distribute prior to the Closing Date any offering material in
connection with the offering and sale of the Common Shares.

     3.33 REGISTRATION RIGHTS. There are no registration or other similar rights
to have any securities registered under the Registration Statement and no other
registration rights exist with respect to the issuance or registration of the
Common Shares by the Company under the Securities Act which have not been
satisfied.

     3.34 DISCLOSURE. To the Company's knowledge, after due and reasonable
investigation, no representation or warranty made by the Company contained in
this Agreement and no statement contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
in or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                                   SECTION 4

           REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE INVESTORS

     Each Investor, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to
the Company as follows:

     4.1 AUTHORIZATION. (i) Such Investor has all requisite legal and corporate
or other power and capacity and has taken all requisite corporate or other
action to execute and deliver this Agreement, to purchase the Common Shares and
Warrant (including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(ii)) to be purchased by it and to carry out and perform all of its
obligations under this Agreement; and (ii) this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of such Investor, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except (A) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (B) as limited by equitable principles
generally.

     4.2 INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Such Investor is an "Accredited Investor" as
defined in Rule 501(A) under the Securities Act. Such Investor is aware of the
Company's business affairs and financial condition and has had access to due
diligence information, and the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive
answers from, representatives of the Company, in each case concerning the
finances, operations, and business of the Company, and has acquired sufficient
information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to
acquire the Common Shares and Warrant (including the additional warrants to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)). Such Investor has such sophistication,
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of investing in the Company, and has the
ability to bear the economic risks of investing in the Company, including a
complete loss of such investment.

     4.3 INVESTMENT INTENT. Such Investor is purchasing the Common Shares and
the Warrant (including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(ii)) for its own account as principal, for investment purposes only, and
not with a present view to, or for, resale, distribution or fractionalization
thereof, in whole or in part, within the meaning of the Securities Act. Such
Investor understands that its acquisition of the Common Shares and the Warrant
(including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii))
has not been registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified
under any state securities law in reliance on specific exemptions therefrom,
which exemptions may depend upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of
such Investor's investment intent as expressed herein. Such Investor will not,
directly or indirectly, offer, sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of
(or solicit any offers to buy, purchase or otherwise acquire or take a pledge
of) any of the Common Shares and the Warrant (including the additional warrants
to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)), except in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement and the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or an exemption
thereunder.

     4.4 REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION REQUIREMENTS. Such Investor further
acknowledges and understands that the Common Shares and the Warrant (including
the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)) may not be
resold or otherwise transferred except in a transaction registered under the
Securities Act or unless an exemption from such registration is available. Such
Investor understands that the Warrant (including the additional warrants to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)) and the certificate(s) evidencing the
Common Shares will be imprinted with a legend that prohibits the transfer of
such securities unless (i) they are registered or such registration is not
required, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3(c), if the
transfer is pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and, if the Company shall so request in writing, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Company is obtained to the effect that the
transaction is so exempt.

     4.5 NO LEGAL, TAX OR INVESTMENT ADVICE; NO RELIANCE ON FAIRNESS OPINION.
Such Investor understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other materials
presented to such Investor in connection with the purchase of the Common Shares
or the Warrant (including the additional warrants to be issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(ii)) constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. Such Investor
has consulted such legal, tax and investment advisors as it, in its sole
discretion, has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with its purchase
of the Common Shares and the Warrant (including the additional warrants to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)). Such Investor has not, and will not,
rely on the fairness opinion, if any, that the Financial Advisor may deliver to
the Company's board of directors with respect to the Transactions.

                                   SECTION 5

                     CONDITIONS TO CLOSING OF THE INVESTORS

the Capitalization Threshold (with each of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) measured

                                   SECTION 7

                            COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

     7.1 REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The Investors shall have the following
registration rights:

          (a) Shelf Registration.

               (i) REGISTRATION. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to
          be prepared and filed with the SEC, as soon as practicable but in any
          event no later than five (5) days after the Closing, a registration
          statement including the prospectus, amendments and supplements to such
          registration statement, including post-effective amendments, all
          exhibits and all materials incorporated by reference or explicitly
          deemed to be incorporated by reference in such registration statement,
          for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant
          to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the resale from time to
          time by the Investors of the Registrable Securities (the "Registration
          Statement"). The Registration Statement shall be on an appropriate
          form permitting registration of such securities for resale by such
          Investors in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by
          the Investors and set forth in the Registration Statement. The Company
          shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
          declared effective under the Securities Act no later than five (5)
          Business Days after receipt of notice of "no review" by the SEC or
          ninety (90) days from the initial filing of such Registration
          Statement in the event of SEC review, and to keep such Registration
          Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the
          earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the expiration of the Lock Up
          Period and (ii) such date as all securities registered on such
          Registration Statement have been resold (the earlier to occur of (i)
          and (ii) is the "Effectiveness Termination Date"); provided, however,
          that the Company may suspend sales of Common Stock pursuant to such
          Registration Statement for a period of not more than forty-five (45)
          days in the aggregate for all cases in which it determines in good
          faith that such Registration Statement contains or may contain an
          untrue statement of material fact or omits or may omit to state a
          material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
          statement therein not misleading; provided further and subject to the
          provisions of this Section 7.1(a)(i), the Company shall promptly amend
          such Registration Statement in order to correct any untrue statement
          and/or ensure that such Registration Statement is not misleading. At
          the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, each
          Investor shall be named as a selling securityholder in the
          Registration Statement and the related prospectus in such a manner as
          to permit such Investor to deliver such prospectus to purchasers of
          registered securities in accordance with applicable law.

               (ii) If the Registration Statement ceases to be effective for any
          reason at any time prior to the applicable Effectiveness Termination
          Date (other than because all securities registered thereunder have
          been resold pursuant thereto), the Company shall use its best efforts
          to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
          effectiveness thereof.

               (iii) The Company shall supplement and amend the Registration
          Statement if required by the rules, regulations or instructions
          applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
          Registration Statement, if required by the Securities Act or, to the
          extent to which the Company does not reasonably object, as reasonably
          requested by Consent of the Investors.

               (iv) Each Investor agrees that if such Investor wishes to sell
          securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, it will do so only
          in accordance with Section 7.1 of this Agreement.

          (b) EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with the registrations pursuant to Section 7.1(a) shall be borne by
the Company. "Registration Expenses" shall mean all expenses incurred by the
Company in complying with Sections 7.1(a) hereof, including all registration and
filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of one counsel for the
Company and reasonable fees and disbursements of Investor Counsel up to $5,000,
blue sky fees and expenses, and the expense of any special audits incident to or
required by any such registration (but excluding the compensation of regular
employees of the Company which shall be paid in any event by the Company and
Selling Expenses (as defined hereinafter)). All Selling Expenses incurred in
connection with any registrations hereunder, shall be borne by the Investors.
"Selling Expenses" shall mean all underwriting discounts and selling commissions
applicable to a sale of the Registrable Securities.

          (c) REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. In the case of a registration, and any
qualification, compliance, or effectiveness effected by the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.1, the Company will keep the Investors advised in writing as to
the initiation of such registration, qualification, compliance and effectiveness
and as to the completion thereof. At its expense the Company will:

               (i) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
          to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection
          with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with
          the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition
          of all securities covered by such registration statement;

               (ii) Furnish to the Investors such numbers of copies of a
          prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the
          requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they
          may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of
          Registrable Securities owned by them;

               (iii) Use its best efforts to register and qualify the securities
          covered by such registration statement under such other securities or
          Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested
          by the Investors, provided that the Company shall not be required in
          connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do
          business or to file a general consent to service of process in any
          such states or jurisdictions;

               (iv) In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into
          and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual
          and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering.
          Each Investor participating in such underwriting shall also enter into
          and perform its obligations under such an agreement;

               (v) Notify immediately each Investor holding Registrable
          Securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a
          prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
          Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the
          prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect,
          includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
          material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
          statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
          then existing; provided, however, that the Company shall promptly
          amend such Registration Statement in order to correct any untrue
          statement and/or ensure that such Registration Statement is not
          misleading;

               (vi) Cause all such Registrable Securities registered hereunder
          to be listed or included on each securities exchange or automated
          quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are
          then listed or included;

               (vii) Provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable
          Securities registered hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such
          Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date
          of such registration; and

               (viii) Use its best efforts to furnish, at the request of any
          Investor requesting registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to
          this Section 7.1, on the date that such Registrable Securities are
          delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a
          registration pursuant to this Section 7.1, if such securities are
          being sold through underwriters, or, if such securities are not being
          sold through underwriters, on the date that the registration statement
          with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion,
          dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes
          of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given in
          an underwritten public offering (and reasonably acceptable to the
          counsel for the Investors), addressed to the underwriters, if any, and
          to the Investors, and (ii) a letter dated such date, from the
          independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and
          substance as is customarily given by independent certified public
          accountants in an underwritten public offering (and reasonably
          acceptable to the counsel for the Investors), addressed to the
          underwriters, to the extent such letter is permitted under generally
          recognized accounting practice.

               (ix) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with legal counsel
          selected by Consent of the Investors ("Investor Counsel") in
          performing the Company's obligations under this Section 7.1 and shall:
          (A) permit Investor Counsel to review and comment upon any offering
          pursuant to this Section 7.1 and to review and comment upon (1) the
          Registration Statement prior to its filing with the SEC and (2) all
          amendments and supplements thereto (except for Annual Reports on Form
          10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K
          and any similar or successor reports) prior to their filing with the
          SEC; and (B) furnish to Investor Counsel, without charge, (1) any
          correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or
          its representatives relating to any Registration Statement, (2)
          promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy
          of any Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including
          financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein
          by reference and all exhibits, and (3) upon the effectiveness of any
          Registration Statement, one copy of the prospectus included in such
          Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto;
          provided that the Company will only be responsible for reasonable fees
          and expenses pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) (ix).

          (d) INDEMNIFICATION.

               (i) The Company will indemnify each Investor, its officers,
          directors, employees, partners, affiliates, agents, representatives
          and legal counsel, and each person controlling (or deemed controlling)
          such Investor within the meaning of the Securities Act (collectively,
          the "Investors' Agents"), with respect to which registration,
          qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this Section
          7.1, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions
          in respect thereof), joint or several, arising out of or based on (i)
          any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
          contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other similar
          document or any amendments or supplements thereto (including any
          related registration statement and amendments or supplements thereto,
          notification or the like) incident to any such registration,
          qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged
          omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
          therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
          the light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (ii) any
          violation by the Company of any federal, state or common law rule or
          regulation applicable to the Company in connection with any such
          registration, qualification or compliance or the failure of the
          Company to fulfill any undertaking made in any registration statement
          or any amendments or supplements thereto, and will reimburse each
          Investor, and each Investors' Agent, for any legal and any other
          expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
          defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as
          incurred, provided that the Company will not be liable in any such
          case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
          expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission
          based upon written information furnished to the Company by an
          instrument duly executed by such Investor and stated to be
          specifically for use therein or furnished in writing by such Investor
          to the Company in response to a request by the Company stating
          specifically that such information will be used by the Company
          therein.

               (ii) Each Investor will indemnify, severally and not jointly, the
          Company, each of its directors and officers, each legal counsel and
          independent accountant of the Company, each person who controls the
          Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any underwriter, and
          each other Investor, against all claims, losses, damages and
          liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on
          any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
          contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering
          circular or other similar document, or any omission (or alleged
          omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
          therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
          the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will
          reimburse the Company, such directors, and officers, control persons,
          underwriter and each other Investor for any legal or any other
          expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
          defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as
          incurred, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
          such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or
          alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus,
          offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity
          with written information furnished in writing to the Company by an
          instrument duly executed by such Investor and stated to be
          specifically for use therein or furnished by such Investor to the
          Company in response to a request by the Company stating specifically
          that such information will be used by the Company therein; provided,
          however, that the indemnity agreement provided in this Section 7.1(d)
          (ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
          claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected
          without the written consent of the Investor, which consent shall not
          be unreasonably withheld. In no event shall an Investor's
          indemnification obligation exceed the net proceeds received from its
          sale of Registrable Securities in such offering.

               (iii) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section
          7.1(d) (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party
          required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
          promptly after such Indemnified Party has received written notice of
          any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the
          Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
          litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the
          Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or
          litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval
          shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party may
          participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided,
          however, that the Indemnifying Party shall bear the expense of such
          defense of the Indemnified Party if representation of both parties by
          the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
          conflicts of interest. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give
          notice within a reasonable period of time as provided herein shall
          relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section
          7.1(d), but only to the extent that such failure to give notice shall
          materially adversely prejudice the Indemnifying Party in the defense
          of any such claim or any such litigation. No Indemnifying Party, in
          the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
          consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or
          enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
          term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
          Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such
          claim or litigation.

               (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1(d)
          is held to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any
          loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then
          the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party
          hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
          Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage,
          or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
          relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the
          Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the statements or
          omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or
          expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations;
          provided, that in no event shall any contribution by an Investor under
          this Section 7.1(d) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received
          by such Investor. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of
          the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
          things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
          fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information
          supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the
          parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and
          opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

               (v) The obligations of the Company and each Investor under this
          Section 7.1 shall survive the completion of any offering of the
          Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement under this Section
          7.1, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
          or any officer, director or controlling Person of such Indemnified
          Party and will survive the transfer of securities.

          (e) INFORMATION BY THE INVESTOR. Each Investor shall furnish to the
Company such information regarding such Investor and the distribution proposed
by such Investor as the Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall
be reasonably required in connection with any registration, qualification or
compliance referred to in this Section 7.1.

          (f) PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION. In addition to the registration rights
granted above, but subject to any normal underwriter's "cut-back," which shall
not exceed 30% of the number of shares proposed by each such Investor to be
registered, during the period from the 180th day after the Closing until the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall grant the Investors
unlimited "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to any other
registration statement filed by the Company with respect to its Common Stock,
but only to the extent that the grant or exercise of such "piggy-back"
registration rights will not violate any agreement to which the Company is now a
party.

          (g) DEMAND REGISTRATION. In addition to the registration rights
granted to the Investors pursuant to Section 7.1(a) above, at any time after the
Effectiveness Termination Date, one or more Investors, holding in aggregate
together with its or their Affiliates at least 5% of all of the outstanding
shares of the Company's Common Stock, may make one written request (the
"Initiating Request") to the Company for the registration under the Securities
Act of all such Investor's Registrable Securities, which request shall specify
the number of shares of Common Stock to be disposed of and the proposed plan of
distribution therefor. Upon the receipt of any Initiating Request for
registration pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), the Company will use its best
efforts to effect, at the earliest possible date (taking into account any delay
that may result from any special audit required by applicable law), such
registration under the Securities Act. The applicable provisions of Sections
7.1(b), (c), (d) and (e) with respect to expenses, registration procedures,
indemnification and information shall apply to any registration statement filed
pursuant to this Section 7.1(g).

          (h) PRIORITY. After the Closing and for so long as the Investors and
their respective Affiliates hold at least 15% of all of the outstanding shares
of the Company's Common Stock, the Company shall not grant any new registration
rights unless the Company receives the consent of Investors holding at least 66
2/3% of all the Common Shares then held by the Investors.

     7.2 REPORTS UNDER EXCHANGE ACT. With a view to making available to the
Investors the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act ("SEC
Rule 144") and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time
permit Investors to sell securities of the Company to the public without
registration or pursuant to a resale registration statement, the Company, so
long as the Investors and their respective Affiliates in the aggregate hold at
least 5% of all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, agrees
to:

          (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times so long as the Company
remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Sections 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act;

          (b) use its best efforts to take such action as is necessary to enable
the Investors to utilize Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is unavailable an appropriate
resale registration statement, for the sale of their Registrable Securities;
provided, that, the parties hereto acknowledge that certain requirements to use
Form S-3 are by their express terms beyond the Company's control, namely, the
Company's market capitalization requirements and that as of the date hereof the
Company is not eligible to use Form S-3;

          (c) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act;
and

          (d) furnish to any Investor, so long as the Investor owns any
Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the
Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities
may be resold pursuant to Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is unavailable an appropriate
resale registration statement, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by
the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in
availing any Investor of any rule or regulation of the SEC which permits the
selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form.

     7.3 ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS. The rights to cause the Company to register
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 7.1 may be assigned by an Investor
only to an Affiliate of such Investor or a permitted transferee of such Investor
pursuant to Section 7.8 or, with the written consent of the Company, which shall

of the State of Delaware and the Company's certificate of incorporation,
certificates of designation, and bylaws, as each may be amended, use its best
efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Common Stock (the "Stockholders'
Meeting") within 30 days (or such other time period that is mutually agreed to
by the Company and the Investors) after the date of the Proxy Statement, to
consider and vote upon giving Stockholder Approval. The board of directors of

directors of the Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation
pursuant to Section 7.14 hereof and to effect any action permitted by Section
8.1 hereof. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company Recommendation, the
Company shall nonetheless cause the Stockholders' Meeting to be convened and a

Company of such obligation unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1.

the Exchange Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, and
promptly mail the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company.

          (b) The Company shall keep the Investors apprised of the status of

replacement designated by Oxford, and such designee shall be the Oxford Designee

to cause such vacancy to be filled by a replacement designated by Venrock, and
such designee shall be the Venrock Designee for purposes of this Agreement. For
so long as any Venrock Designee remains a member of the board of directors and

aggregate together with its or their Affiliates at least 5% of all of the

     7.8 LOCK-UP. The Company shall enter into an agreement with each member of
the Management Team, each Investor, and each current director who shall continue
serving as a director after the Closing (each such Investor, director, or member

agreement shall provide that each such Holder shall not, directly or indirectly
sell, offer to sell, contract to sell (including any short sale), grant any

Affiliates who agree to be similarly bound) any securities of the Company held
by it for a period of 180 days following the Closing Date (the "Lock-Up

law, indemnify and hold harmless each Investor, and each of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, agents and employees (the "Investor Indemnitees") from and
against any losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable fees
of counsel and any amounts paid in settlement effected with the Company's prior
written consent) or liabilities (each a "Loss," collectively "Losses") to which
the Investor Indemnitees may become subject insofar as such Losses (or Actions
or Proceedings, as defined below) arise out of or in connection with, directly
or indirectly, any breach or non-fulfillment of, or non-compliance with, any
representations, warranties, agreements, or covenants of the Company in this
Agreement or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement. The Company will
indemnify and hold harmless the Investor Indemnitees from and against any and
all Losses and from and against any and all damages, costs, liabilities and
attorneys' fees, incurred in defending and/or resolving such Losses, Action or
Proceeding; provided, that (i) the Company is promptly notified in writing of
such Action or Proceeding (provided that any failure to deliver such notice will
not relieve the Company of liability under this Section 7.12 except to the
extent such failure is materially prejudicial to the Company's ability to defend
such Action or Proceeding), (ii) the Company will have the sole control of the
defense and/or settlement of such Action or Proceeding (provided that, if
representation of the Investor Indemnitees by counsel retained by the Company
would be inappropriate due to any actual or potential differing interest between
the Investor Indemnitee and the Company or any third party represented by such
counsel, the Investor Indemnitees will have the right to retain one separate
counsel, with reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the Company), (iii) the
Investor Indemnitees furnish to the Company, on reasonable request, information
available to the Investor Indemnitees for such defense, (iv) the Investor
Indemnitees reasonably cooperate in any defense and/or settlement thereof as
long as the Company pays all of the Investor Indemnitees' reasonable out of
pocket expenses and attorneys' fees, and (v) the Company shall have no
indemnification obligations pursuant to this section until the aggregate amount
of such Losses with respect to all Investor Indemnitees exceeds $250,000 in the
aggregate, in which case such Investor Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover
the full amount of all Losses. The Investor Indemnitees will not admit any such
Action or Proceeding or any allegations made in such Action or Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Company (which will not be unreasonably
withheld). For purposes of this Agreement, an "Action or Proceeding" means any
action, suit, litigation, proceeding, mediation, arbitration or investigation or
audit by any Person.

     7.13 OPERATION OF BUSINESS. The Company's budget and planning for 2003 has
been presented to the Investors. The Company agrees that, between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, except as expressly contemplated by any provision of this
Agreement, (i) the business of the Company shall be conducted only in, and the
Company shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of business,
(ii) other than with respect to any compensation arrangement disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall not increase the compensation
payable, or to become payable, to any officer or director of the Company or to
enter into or amend in any material way any employment, consulting, severance or
termination agreement or arrangement with any such officer or director, and
(iii) the Company shall use its best efforts to preserve its business
organization intact, to keep available the services of its current officers and
employees, consistent with the budget and planning presented to the Investors,
and to maintain its existing relations with suppliers, creditors, business
partners and others having business dealings with the Company, to the end that
the Company's goodwill and ongoing business shall be unimpaired at the Closing
Date.

     7.14 NO-SOLICITATION.

          (a) The Company and its directors, officers, employees,
representatives and agents, including investment bankers, attorneys and
accountants of the Company (the "Representatives") shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate (including by way
of furnishing or disclosing nonpublic information), any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, or a transaction to effect, any Alternative Proposal; (ii) have any
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to any Alternative Proposal, or negotiate with any Person concerning an
Alternative Proposal, or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
any Alternative Proposal; (iii) agree to or endorse, or propose publicly to
agree to or endorse, any Alternative Proposal, or authorize or permit any of the
Company's Representatives to take any such action; or (iv) agree to or endorse,
or propose to agree to or endorse, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, financing agreement, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement or propose
publicly to agree to do any of the foregoing relating to any Alternative
Proposal.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company (and its board of directors) shall be permitted to
(i) comply with applicable law with regard to an Alternative Proposal, (ii)
effect a Change in the Company Recommendation or (iii) provide information in
connection with, and negotiate, an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal
regarding an Alternative Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in any such
case referred to in clause (ii) or (iii):

               (i) the Stockholders' Meeting shall not have occurred;

               (ii) the Company's board of directors shall have determined in
          good faith, after considering applicable law, and acting upon the
          written advice of independent outside counsel, that such Alternative
          Proposal is superior from a financial point of view to the
          Transactions and effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation is
          required in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply
          with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
          applicable law; and

               (iii) prior to providing any information or data to any Person or
          entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, the Company
          notifies the Investors within 24 hours of receipt of any proposal or
          offer regarding an Alternative Proposal, or any inquiry or contact
          with any Person with respect thereto, such notice to include the
          identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
          contact, and the terms of such Alternative Proposal.

          (c) Subject to Section 7.21, "Alternative Proposal" means any proposal
or offer from any Person other than the Investors or their Affiliates to (i)
acquire all or substantially all of the business, properties, or other assets of
the Company, or (ii) purchase or acquire twenty percent (20%) or more of the
business, properties or other assets or capital stock or other equity interests
in the Company, whether by share issuance, equity or convertible debt financing,
sale of stock or assets, merger, consolidation, other business combination,
tender offer or exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution, license agreement, mortgage, lease or other transaction involving
the Company, any division or operating or principal business unit or the
Intellectual Property of the Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on
the other hand; or (iii) enter into any transaction, that if consummated, would
result in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning
securities representing 20% or more of the total voting power of the Company (or
of the surviving parent entity in such transaction).

     7.15 REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION; REPRESENTATIONS. Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties to this
Agreement shall use reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this
Agreement shall give prompt notice to each other party to this Agreement upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by such party in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate or that such party has failed to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such party under this Agreement,
in each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 or Section 6.1,
as the case may be, would not be satisfied. No party to this Agreement shall
take any action that would cause any representation or warranty made by such
party in this Agreement to be untrue if made at Closing.

     7.16 PARTICIPATION RIGHTS.

          (a) PARTICIPATION RIGHTS. The parties hereby agree that each Investor,
so long as such Investor and its respective Affiliates hold at least 10% of all
of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock or holds all of the
Common Shares purchased by such Investor hereunder, shall have the right (the
"Participation Right"), but not the obligation, to purchase its Pro Rata Share
(as defined below) of all (or any part) of any New Securities (as defined
below). "Pro Rata Share" equals a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock then owned by such Investor (or receivable
by such Investor upon conversion or exchange of all then outstanding Company
Options held by such investor) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum
of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding plus (ii) the
total number of shares of Common Stock into which all then outstanding Company
Options are then convertible or are exchangeable.

          (b) NEW SECURITIES. For purposes of this Agreement, "New Securities"
shall mean any Common Stock or preferred stock of the Company, whether now
authorized or not, and Company Options; provided, however, that the term "New
Securities" does not include:

               (i) any securities, including shares of Common Stock, to be
          issued pursuant to a "public offering" (as such term is determined by
          the rules, regulations and guidelines of the National Association of
          Securities Dealers) of such securities, or issued pursuant to a
          registration statement on a Form S-4 or S-8 or substantially
          equivalent successor form, or, upon the approval of a majority of the
          entire board of directors of the Company (i.e., a majority of the
          total number of directors then in office), any shares issued pursuant
          to registration statement and offered publicly (the parties hereto
          agree that merely because an offering is to be undertaken as a
          "take-down" from a shelf registration statement, that factor will not
          be the sole determinative factor as to whether such offering is a
          "public offering");

               (ii) shares of the Common Stock (or options therefor) issued or
          issuable to employees, officers, directors, consultants or other
          service providers of the Company pursuant to stock options or other
          stock incentive agreements or plans approved by a majority of the
          Company's board of directors and not for capital-raising transactions;

               (iii) any securities issued upon the conversion or exercise of
          Company Options;

               (iv) any shares of Common Stock (or any other security) issued in
          connection with any stock split, stock dividend, combination,
          recapitalization or similar corporate action for which no
          consideration is paid or payable;

               (v) any shares of Common Stock (or any other security) issued in
          connection with (A) any corporate collaboration agreement, (B) any
          licensing agreement, (C) any payment or settlement of any obligation
          under a Company Agreement, and (D) as compensation for any services
          rendered to the Company;

               (vi) any securities issued pursuant to an acquisition of the
          Company approved by its board of directors by means of (A) merger or
          other form of corporate reorganization in which outstanding shares of
          the Company are exchanged for securities or other consideration
          issued, or caused to be issued, by the acquiring corporation or its
          subsidiary and pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting
          securities of the Company immediately prior to such merger or other
          form of corporate reorganization fail to hold equity securities
          representing a majority of the voting power of the Company or
          surviving entity immediately following such merger or other form of
          corporate reorganization, or (B) a sale of all or substantially all
          the assets of the Company approved by the Company's board of
          directors;

               (vii) any securities issued in connection with bona fide
          equipment financings or bona fide lease agreements; or

               (viii) any securities issued in transactions approved by the
          board of directors (i.e., a majority of the total number of directors
          then in office) as being excluded from the provisions of this Section
          7.16.

          (c) PROCEDURES.

               (i) If the Company proposes to undertake any issuance of New
          Securities, it shall, prior to any such issuance, give written notice
          to the Investors of its bona fide intention to issue New Securities
          (the "Company Notice"), describing the type of New Securities proposed
          to be issued, the total number or quantity of New Securities proposed
          to be issued, and the price and the general terms upon which the
          Company proposes to issue such New Securities. Each Investor may elect
          to purchase or acquire its Pro Rata Share of such New Securities (an
          "Electing Party") by delivering written notice (the "Participation
          Notice") of its election to so purchase or acquire such New Securities
          at the price and upon the general terms specified in the Company
          Notice and stating the quantity of New Securities to be purchased (not
          to exceed its Pro Rata Share). The Participation Notice shall be
          delivered to the Company within five (5) Business Days after the date
          of delivery of the Company Notice, and the obligations of the Electing
          Party thereunder to purchase the elected number or percentage of New
          Securities, and the obligations of the Company to sell such New
          Securities to the Electing Party, shall be contingent upon the
          consummation of the sale or other transaction pursuant to which the
          New Securities are proposed to be issued. The number or amount of New
          Securities specified in the Participation Notice shall be subject to
          automatic and proportionate reduction in the event that the total
          number or quantity of New Securities sold by the Company is reduced
          below the number or quantity specified in the Company Notice.

               (ii) If any Investor fails to give the Participation Notice to
          the Company within such five (5) Business Day period, or specifies in
          the Participation Notice that such Investor will only purchase part,
          but not all, of such Investor's Pro Rata Share (a "Nonpurchasing
          Investor"), then such Nonpurchasing Investor shall forfeit the right
          hereunder to purchase that part of its Pro Rata Share of such New
          Securities that it did not so agree to purchase and the Company shall
          promptly give each Investor (if any) who has timely agreed to purchase
          its full Pro Rata Share of such offering of New Securities (a
          "Purchasing Investor") written notice of the failure of any
          Nonpurchasing Investor to purchase such Nonpurchasing Investor's full
          Pro Rata Share of such offering of New Securities (the "Overallotment
          Notice.") Such Overallotment Notice shall be given to each Purchasing
          Investor within three (3) Business Days of the expiration of the five
          (5) Business Day period. Each Purchasing Investor shall have a right
          of overallotment such that such Purchasing Investor may agree to
          purchase a portion of the Nonpurchasing Investor's unpurchased Pro
          Rata Share of such offering on a pro rata basis according to the
          relative Pro Rata Shares of the Purchasing Investor at any time within
          three (3) Business Days after receiving the Overallotment Notice.

          (d) FAILURE TO EXERCISE. If the Investors fail to exercise in full the
Participation Right within such five (5) plus three (3) plus three (3) Business
Day period, then the Company shall have One Hundred Eighty (180) calendar days
thereafter to sell the New Securities with respect to which the Investors'
Participation Rights hereunder were not exercised, at a price not less than, and
upon general terms not more favorable than those specified in the Company
Notice. If the Company has not issued and sold the New Securities within such
One Hundred Eighty (180) calendar day period, then the Company shall not
thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without again first offering such
New Securities to the Investors pursuant to this Section 7.16.

          (e) SUBSEQUENT PARTICIPATION RIGHT. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any holder or
prospective holder of any securities which would allow such holder or
prospective holder a participation right, right of first refusal, right of first
offer or other similar right which is on terms materially more favorable to such
holder or prospective holder than, or in preference to, the Participation Right
granted to the Investors hereunder.

     7.17 EXECUTIVE RECRUITING FIRM. The Company shall retain an executive
recruiting firm, reasonably acceptable to the Investors, to conduct a search for
a Senior Vice President of Development until such time as a Senior Vice
President of Development is hired by the Company or a majority of the board of
directors (i.e., a majority of the total number of directors then in office)
approves a termination of such search.

     7.18 MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION PLAN. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Company entered into new employment agreements with its C.E.O., C.F.O. and Chief
Scientific Officer in the form of Exhibits H-1, H-2, and H-3, respectively, each
to be effective upon Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall have granted options to the individuals and in the amounts set forth on
Section 7.13 of the Company Disclosure Statement.

     7.19 WAIVERS. The Company shall keep in full force and effect the
agreements listed in Sections 3.11(n)(7) and 3.11(n)(8) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

     7.20 BOARD OBSERVERS. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, a
representative (who shall be acceptable to the Company in its reasonable
judgment) of each of Sprout, Oxford and Venrock (each an "Observer") shall have
the right to attend all meetings of the board of directors of the Company in a
nonvoting observer capacity, to receive notice of such meetings and to receive
the information provided by the Company to the board of directors; provided,
however, that the Company reserves the right to withhold any information and to
exclude any Observer from any meeting or portion thereof (so long as the Company
notifies such Observer of such withholding) if access to such information or
attendance at such meeting would in the good faith determination of the board of
directors (a) adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel or cause the board of directors to breach its fiduciary duties,
(b) result in a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest with the
Company, or (c) impair the Company's ability to enforce its rights under this
Agreement in any bona fide dispute with the Observer. Each Observer agrees to
hold all information received pursuant to this Section 7.20 in confidence, to
enter into a reasonable confidentiality agreement with the Company, and not to
use or disclose any of such information to any third party, except to the extent
such information is known, or when such information becomes known, to the public
(other than as a result of a breach of this sentence by any Observer) (such
non-public information, "Confidential Information"); provided, however, that an
Observer may disclose Confidential Information as may be required by law, after
receiving written advice of counsel that such disclosure is required, provided
that such Observer takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such
required disclosure. The Company recognizes that certain of the Observers or
their Affiliates are engaged in the business of providing venture capital
financing and management advice to companies in which they invest (the "Venture
Investors"), and that in their business the Venture Investors may seek to invest
in and/or provide advice to companies that may be competitive with the Company.
Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company understands and agrees that nothing in this Agreement will restrict the
Venture Investors from investing or participating in the management of any
business or entity which competes or may compete, directly or indirectly, with
the Company so long as such Venture Investor does not disclose any Confidential
Information to such business or entity or help or otherwise assist such business
or entity to use such information in violation hereof. The Company further
agrees that, provided a Venture Investor does not disclose Confidential
Information to a third-party in violation hereof, such Venture Investor shall be
free to use for internal use in its business any information it has obtained or
will obtain from the Company; provided, however, that any recipient of such
information is similarly restricted with respect to Confidential Information;
and provided, further, such Venture Investor shall not disclose any such
information to an officer, director, Affiliate, employee, or significant
stockholder of any business or entity that competes or may reasonably be deemed
to compete, directly or indirectly, with the Company.

     7.21 THIRD PARTY OFFER. During the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing or the effective date of termination of this Agreement, if the
Company intends to seek any financing or to seek any transaction not in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that would qualify as
an Alternative Proposal but for the 20% threshold specified in Section 7.14(c)
or is approached by any third party with any offer to provide such financing or
transaction that the Company does not immediately and unconditionally reject (a
"Third Party Offer"), the Company shall first endeavor to negotiate with the
Investors, for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) Business Days, a financing or
transaction comparable to the Third Party Offer. The Company and the Investors
shall negotiate in good faith with respect to such financing or transaction, but
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Investors to
provide, on the one hand, or the Company to accept, on the other hand, any such
financing or transaction; provided, however, that if the Company receives a
Third Party Offer, the Company shall notify the Investors of the amount of such
offer and all the other material terms of such offer and, if the Investors,
within the fifteen (15) Business Day period specified above, offer to provide
financing to, or enter into a transaction with, the Company in the amount, as
applicable, and on terms no less favorable than those contained in the Third
Party Offer, the Company shall accept the Investors' offer, if it accepts any
offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that any Third Party
Offer involving the right of a Person other than the Investors or their
Affiliates to (i) purchase or acquire less than 20% of the business, properties
or other assets or capital stock or other equity interests in the Company,
whether by share issuance, equity or convertible debt financing, sale of stock
or assets, merger, consolidation, other business combination, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution,
license agreement, mortgage, lease or other transaction involving the Company,
any division or operating or principal business unit or the Intellectual
Property of the Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other
hand or (ii) enter into any transaction, that if consummated, would result in
any Person (or the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning securities
representing less than 20% of the total voting power of the Company (or of the
surviving parent entity in such transaction) shall be deemed a Third Party Offer
and not an Alternative Proposal.

                                   SECTION 8

                                  TERMINATION

     8.1 TERMINATION EVENTS. Without prejudice to other remedies which may be
available to the parties by law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing:

          (a) Mutually, by the written consent of the Company and Consent of the
Investors;

          (b) by either the Company or Consent of the Investors by giving
written notice to the other party or parties if the Closing shall not have
occurred prior to June 30, 2003, unless extended by written agreement of the
parties; provided that the party seeking termination pursuant to this subsection
(b) is not in default or breach hereunder and provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (b) shall not be available (i)
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date or (ii) in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred
as a result of a failure of any representation to be true and correct in all
material respects and the party seeking termination knew of such breach prior to
the date of this Agreement (such failing or knowing party being the "Delaying
Party");

          (c) by either the Company or Consent of the Investors by giving
written notice to the other party or parties if any Governmental Entity shall
have issued an injunction or other ruling prohibiting the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such injunction or other
ruling shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and
unappealable;

          (d) by either the Company or Consent of the Investors in the event
that Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting; or

          (e) by the Company, if the Company's board of directors shall have
recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Alternative Proposal; provided
that, in order for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this clause (e)
to be deemed effective, the Company shall have complied with all provisions of
Sections 7.4, 7.14, and 7.21.

     8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability on the part of any party or its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates in respect thereof; provided, however, that (A) such
termination shall not relieve the Company or any Investor of any liability for
any breach or non-fulfillment of, or non-compliance with, this Agreement; and
(B) if the Company terminates this Agreement (i) pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and
within six (6) months thereafter enters into a definitive agreement regarding an
Alternative Proposal and the Investors are not a Delaying Party or (ii) pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay the Investors an aggregate of
Two-Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) and in addition shall promptly
reimburse the Investors for their reasonable, documented legal, financial, due
diligence, and advisory fees and expenses; and (C) if the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), the Company shall promptly reimburse
the Investors for their reasonable, documented legal, financial, due diligence,
and advisory fees and expenses.

                                   SECTION 9

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

     9.1 WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended,
waived or modified only upon the written consent of the Company and Consent of
the Investors; except that no amendment, waiver or modification of this Section
9.1, the definition of Consent of the Investors, any provision of the Schedule
of Investors on Exhibit A hereto, the form of Warrant annexed as Exhibit B
hereto, or any of the conditions to the Investors' obligations set forth herein
in Section 5, and no amendment, waiver or modification of any provision of this
Agreement which is detrimental to any Investor in a manner materially different
from any other Investor, shall be made without the consent of each affected
Investor. Subject to the foregoing, any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this Section 9.1 shall be binding upon each Investor and the
Company.

     9.2 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without any
regard to conflicts of laws principles.

     9.3 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; TRIAL COSTS. Each of the Company, for itself and
its Affiliates, and Investors hereby irrevocably waive all right to trial by
jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the actions of the Company and the
Investors or their Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement in the negotiation,
administration, performance or enforcement thereof. The party in whose favor a
final judgment is rendered shall be entitled to reasonable costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees.

     9.4 SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing, and all covenants and agreements shall survive until

terminated) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

     9.5 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions hereof shall inure to the
benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and

obligations or benefits under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party.

     9.8 INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits
or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The phrase "provided to," "furnished
to," or "made available" and terms of similar import in this Agreement means
that the information referred to has been made available to the Investors or
their representatives in the data room established at the Company's principal
office while such Investors or their representatives had access to such data
room and that the Company has used a reasonable procedure for informing the
Investors or their representatives of new or changed information in the data
room. In this Agreement, the phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date
hereof", and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to February 11, 2003. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     9.9 SEVERABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid, legal, and
enforceable under all applicable laws and regulations. If, however, any
provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under
any such law or regulation in any jurisdiction, it shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be deemed modified to conform to the minimum requirements of such
law or regulation, or, if for any reason it is not deemed so modified, it shall
be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality, or limitation on enforceability without affecting the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, or the validity, legality, or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     9.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument.

     9.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party to this Agreement shall do and perform
or cause to be done and performed all such further acts and things and shall
execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and
documents as the other party hereto may reasonably request in order to carry out
the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     9.12 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Except as may be required by law or regulation,
the Company shall not use the name of, or make reference to, any Investor or any
of its Affiliates in any press release or in any public manner (including any
reports or filings made by the Company under the Exchange Act) without such
Investor's prior written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be approved by the Company and Sprout, Oxford and Venrock on
behalf of the Investors. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
Company and the Investors shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement
or the Transactions without the prior consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the Company, on the
one hand, and the Investors, on the other hand, may, without the prior consent
of the other party, issue a press release or make such public statement as may,
upon the advice of counsel, be required by law if it has used all reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party.

     9.13 EXPENSES. The Company shall bear its own expenses, and shall, subject
to the Closing, pay the Investor's reasonable legal fees and expenses of the
Investor Counsel, up to $175,000, and financial, due diligence, and advisory
fees and expenses, up to $75,000, incurred with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions.

     9.14 COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE.

          (a) Disclosure of information in any one section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosure in another section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule if and to the extent it is clear from a reading of
such section, without any additional information, that such disclosure is
applicable to such other section. The Company Disclosure Schedule is qualified
in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement, and is
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representation or warranties of the Company except as and to the extent provided
in this Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule: (1)
does not represent a determination by the Company that such item (i) is material
nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality (except to the
extent that this Agreement provides otherwise) or (ii) did not arise in the
ordinary course of business (except to the extent that this Agreement provides
otherwise) and (2) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any
third party concerning such item by the Company.

          (b) Notwithstanding any disclosure to the contrary in the Disclosure
Schedule, if the Company were deemed to have any Subsidiary, then (i) the
Company's representations and warranties referencing the Company hereunder shall
be deemed to be modified so that for each such representation and warranty the
Company shall be deemed to have made a corresponding representation and warranty
referencing such Subsidiary, and (ii) the definitions in Section 1 that make
reference to the Company shall, as appropriate, be deemed to be modified to also
make reference to such Subsidiary.

                                 FORM OF WARRANT


THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED UPON EXERCISE HEREOF
HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY
STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO SALE OR DISPOSITION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT (I) AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO, (II) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR
OTHER EVIDENCE, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT SUCH REGISTRATION
IS NOT REQUIRED, (III) RECEIPT OF NO-ACTION LETTERS FROM THE APPROPRIATE
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, OR (IV) OTHERWISE COMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
SECTION 7 OF THIS WARRANT.

                         RIBOZYME PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

                         WARRANT TO PURCHASE ____ SHARES
                                 OF COMMON STOCK

                                                              Warrant No. W-___

     THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, ___________and its assigns are
entitled to subscribe for and purchase [___________________________] shares (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the "SHARES") of the fully paid and
nonassessable common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("COMMON STOCK"), of
Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), at the
price of $0.42 per share (such price and such other price as shall result, from
time to time, from the adjustments specified in Section 4 hereof is herein
referred to as the "WARRANT PRICE"), subject to the provisions and upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. As used herein, (a) the term "DATE
OF GRANT" means the date of the "Closing" as defined in the Common Stock and
Warrant Purchase Agreement dated as of February ___, 2003 among the Company and
the investors listed on EXHIBIT A thereto (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), and (b)
the term "OTHER WARRANTS" means any other warrants issued by the Company in
connection with the transaction with respect to which this Warrant was issued,
and any warrant issued upon transfer or partial exercise of this Warrant. The
term "WARRANT" as used herein shall be deemed to include Other Warrants unless
the context clearly requires otherwise.

     1. TERM. The purchase right represented by this Warrant is exercisable, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from the Date of Grant
through five (5) years after the Date of Grant.

     2. METHOD OF EXERCISE; PAYMENT; ISSUANCE OF NEW WARRANT. Subject to Section
1 hereof, the purchase right represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the
holder hereof, in whole or in part and from time to time, at the election of the
holder hereof, by (a) the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise
substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A-1 duly completed and
executed) at the principal office of the Company and by the payment to the
Company, by certified or bank check, or by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Company (a "WIRE TRANSFER") of an amount equal to the then
applicable Warrant Price multiplied by the number of Shares then being
purchased, or (b) if in connection with a registered public offering of the
Company's securities, the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise
form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A-2 duly completed and executed) at the
principal office of the Company together with notice of arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Company for payment to the Company either by certified or
bank check or by Wire Transfer from the proceeds of the sale of shares to be
sold by the holder in such public offering of an amount equal to the then
applicable Warrant Price per share multiplied by the number of Shares then being
purchased, or (c) exercise of the "net issuance" right provided for in Section
10.2 hereof. The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s)
representing the Shares shall be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder(s) of, the shares represented thereby (and such
shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of
business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised. In the event
of any exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, certificates for the
shares of stock so purchased shall be delivered to the holder hereof as soon as
practicable and, if requested by the holder of this Warrant, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to deliver the certificate representing Shares issued
upon exercise of this Warrant to a broker or other person (as directed by the
holder exercising this Warrant) within the time period required to settle any
trade made by the holder after exercise of this Warrant.

     3. STOCK FULLY PAID; RESERVATION OF SHARES. All Shares that may be issued
upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance
pursuant to the terms and conditions herein, be fully paid and nonassessable,
and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be
exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized, and reserved for the
purpose of the issue upon exercise of the purchase rights evidenced by this
Warrant, a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock to provide for the
exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant.

     4. ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE AND NUMBER OF SHARES. The number and kind of
securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Warrant Price
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain
events, as follows:

          (a) RECLASSIFICATION OR MERGER. In case of any reclassification or
     change of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
     (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or
     from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or
     combination), or in case of any merger of the Company with or into another
     corporation (other than a merger with another corporation in which the
     Company is the acquiring and the surviving corporation and which does not
     result in any reclassification or change of outstanding securities issuable
     upon exercise of this Warrant), or in case of any sale of all or
     substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Company, or such
     successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall duly execute
     and deliver to the holder of this Warrant a new Warrant (in form and
     substance satisfactory to the holder of this Warrant), or the Company shall
     make appropriate provision without the issuance of a new Warrant, so that
     the holder of this Warrant shall have the right to receive upon exercise of
     this Warrant, at a total purchase price not to exceed that payable upon the
     exercise of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, and in lieu of the
     shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant,
     the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and
     property receivable upon such reclassification, change or merger by a
     holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then purchasable under this
     Warrant. Such new Warrant shall provide for adjustments that shall be as
     nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in
     this Section 4. The provisions of this subparagraph (a) shall similarly
     apply to successive reclassifications, changes, mergers and transfers.

          (b) SUBDIVISION OR COMBINATION OF SHARES. If the Company at any time
     while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide or
     combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price shall be
     proportionately decreased and the number of Shares issuable hereunder shall
     be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or the Warrant
     Price shall be proportionately increased and the number of Shares issuable
     hereunder shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a combination.

          (c) STOCK DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. If the Company at any
     time while this Warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall pay a dividend
     or make a distribution to all of its stockholders with respect to its
     Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then the Warrant Price shall be
     adjusted, from and after the date of determination of stockholders entitled
     to receive such dividend or distribution, to that price determined by
     multiplying the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such date of
     determination by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total
     number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
     dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the
     total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
     dividend or distribution.

          (d) ADJUSTMENT OF NUMBER OF SHARES. Upon each adjustment in the
     Warrant Price, the number of Shares purchasable hereunder shall be
     adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to the product obtained by
     multiplying the number of Shares purchasable immediately prior to such
     adjustment in the Warrant Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
     be the Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment and the
     denominator of which shall be the Warrant Price immediately thereafter.

     5. NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS. Whenever the Warrant Price or the number of
Shares purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the
Company shall make a certificate signed by its chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or any vice president setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by
which such adjustment was calculated, and the Warrant Price and the number of
Shares purchasable hereunder after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall
cause copies of such certificate to be mailed (without regard to Section 13
hereof, by first class mail, postage prepaid) to the holder of this Warrant at
such holder's last known address.

     6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued
in connection with any exercise hereunder, but in lieu of such fractional shares
the Company shall make a cash payment therefor based on the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date of exercise as reasonably determined in good faith
by the Company's Board of Directors.

     7. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES ACT; DISPOSITION OF WARRANT OR SHARES OF
COMMON STOCK.

          (a) COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES ACT. The holder of this Warrant, by
     acceptance hereof, agrees that this Warrant, and the Shares to be issued
     upon exercise hereof are being acquired for investment and that such holder
     will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of this Warrant, or any Shares
     except under circumstances which will not result in a violation of the
     Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT") or any applicable state
     securities laws. Upon exercise of this Warrant, unless the Shares being
     acquired are registered under the Act and any applicable state securities
     laws or an exemption from such registration is available, the holder hereof
     shall confirm in writing that the Shares so purchased are being acquired
     for investment and not with a view toward distribution or resale in
     violation of the Act and shall confirm such other matters related thereto
     as may be reasonably requested by the Company. This Warrant and all Shares
     issued upon exercise of this Warrant (unless registered under the Act and
     any applicable state securities laws) shall be stamped or imprinted with a
     legend in substantially the following form:

          "THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
          SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO
          SALE OR DISPOSITION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT (I) AN EFFECTIVE
          REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO, (II) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR
          OTHER EVIDENCE, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT SUCH
          REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED, (III) RECEIPT OF NO-ACTION LETTERS FROM
          THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, OR (IV) OTHERWISE COMPLYING
          WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 7 OF THE WARRANT UNDER WHICH THESE
          SECURITIES WERE ISSUED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY."

     Said legend shall be removed by the Company, upon the request of a holder,
at such time as the restrictions on the transfer of the applicable security
shall have terminated. In addition, in connection with the issuance of this
Warrant, the holder specifically represents to the Company by acceptance of this
Warrant as follows:

               (1) The holder is aware of the Company's business affairs and
          financial condition, and has acquired information about the Company
          sufficient to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire
          this Warrant. The holder is acquiring this Warrant for its own account
          for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for the resale
          in connection with, any "distribution" thereof in violation of the
          Act.

               (2) The holder understands that this Warrant has not been
          registered under the Act in reliance upon a specific exemption
          therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona
          fide nature of the holder's investment intent as expressed herein.

               (3) The holder further understands that this Warrant must be held
          indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Act and
          qualified under any applicable state securities laws, or unless
          exemptions from registration and qualification are otherwise
          available. The holder is aware of the provisions of Rule 144,
          promulgated under the Act.

               (4) The holder is an "accredited investor" as such term is
          defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act.

          (b) DISPOSITION OF WARRANT OR SHARES. With respect to any offer, sale
     or other disposition of this Warrant or any Shares acquired pursuant to the
     exercise of this Warrant prior to registration of such Warrant or Shares,
     the holder hereof agrees to give written notice to the Company prior
     thereto, describing briefly the manner thereof, together with a written
     opinion of such holder's counsel, or other evidence satisfactory to the
     Company, to the effect that such offer, sale or other disposition may be
     effected without registration or qualification (under the Act as then in
     effect or any federal or state securities law then in effect) of this
     Warrant or the Shares and indicating whether or not under the Act
     certificates for this Warrant or the Shares to be sold or otherwise
     disposed of require any restrictive legend as to applicable restrictions on
     transferability in order to ensure compliance with such law. Upon receiving
     such written notice and reasonably satisfactory opinion or other evidence,
     the Company, as promptly as practicable but no later than fifteen (15) days
     after receipt of the written notice, shall notify such holder that such
     holder may sell or otherwise dispose of this Warrant or such Shares, all in
     accordance with the terms of the notice delivered to the Company. If a
     determination has been made pursuant to this Section 7(b) that the opinion
     of counsel for the holder or other evidence is not reasonably satisfactory
     to the Company, the Company shall so notify the holder promptly with
     details thereof after such determination has been made. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, this Warrant or such Shares may, as to such federal laws, be
     offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Rule 144 or 144A
     under the Act, provided that the Company shall have been furnished with
     such information as the Company may reasonably request to provide a
     reasonable assurance that the provisions of Rule 144 or 144A have been
     satisfied. Each certificate representing this Warrant or the Shares thus
     transferred (except a transfer pursuant to Rule 144) shall bear a legend as
     to the applicable restrictions on transferability in order to ensure
     compliance with such laws, unless in the aforesaid opinion of counsel for
     the holder, such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with
     such laws. The Company may issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer
     agent in connection with such restrictions.

          (c) APPLICABILITY OF RESTRICTIONS. Neither any restrictions of any
     legend described in this Warrant nor the requirements of Section 7(b) above
     shall apply to any transfer or grant of a security interest in, this
     Warrant (or the shares of Common Stock obtainable upon exercise thereof) or
     any part hereof (i) to a partner of the holder if the holder is a
     partnership or to a member of the holder if the holder is a limited
     liability company, (ii) to a partnership of which the holder is a partner
     or a limited liability company of which the holder is a member, or (iii) to
     any affiliate of the holder if the holder is a corporation; provided,
     however, in any such transfer, if applicable, the transferee shall on the
     Company's request agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Warrant
     as if an original holder hereof.

     8. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS. No holder of this Warrant, as such, shall be
entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of Common Stock or
any other securities which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof
for any purpose, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon
the holder of this Warrant, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the
Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter
submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to receive notice of
meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this
Warrant shall have been exercised and the Shares purchasable upon the exercise
hereof shall have become deliverable, as provided herein.

     9. REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The Company grants registration rights to the
holder of this Warrant for any shares of Common Stock of the Company obtained
upon exercise hereof as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

     10. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

     10.1. MERGERS. The Company shall provide the holder of this Warrant with at
least twenty (20) days' written notice prior to the closing thereof of the terms
and conditions of any of the following transactions: (i) the sale, lease,
exchange, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Company's property or business, or (ii) its merger into or consolidation with
any other corporation (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), or
(iii) any transaction (including a merger or other reorganization) or series of
related transactions, in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Company
is disposed of.

     10.2. RIGHT TO CONVERT WARRANT INTO STOCK: NET ISSUANCE.

          (a) RIGHT TO CONVERT. In addition to and without limiting the rights
     of the holder under the terms of this Warrant, the holder shall have the
     right to convert this Warrant or any portion thereof (the "CONVERSION
     RIGHT") into shares of Common Stock as provided in this Section 10.2 at any
     time or from time to time during the term of this Warrant. Upon exercise of
     the Conversion Right with respect to a particular number of shares subject
     to this Warrant (the "CONVERTED WARRANT SHARES"), the Company shall deliver
     to the holder (without payment by the holder of any exercise price or any
     cash or other consideration) that number of shares of fully paid and
     nonassessable Common Stock as is determined according to the following
     formula:

                    X =   B - A
                          -----
                            Y

             Where: X = the number of shares of Common Stock that may be
                    issued to the holder.

                    Y = the fair market value of one share of Common Stock.

                    A = the aggregate Warrant Price of the specified number of
                    Converted Warrant Shares immediately prior to the exercise
                    of the Conversion Right (i.e., the number of Converted
                    Warrant Shares multiplied by the Warrant Price).

                    B = the aggregate fair market value of the specified number
                    of Converted Warrant Shares (i.e., the number of Converted
                    Warrant Shares multiplied by the fair market value of one
                    Converted Warrant Shares).

     No fractional shares shall be issuable upon exercise of the Conversion
Right, and, if the number of shares to be issued determined in accordance with
the foregoing formula is other than a whole number, the Company shall pay to the
holder an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of the resulting
fractional share on the Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined). For purposes
of Section 9 of this Warrant, shares issued pursuant to the Conversion Right
shall be treated as if they were issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.

          (b) METHOD OF EXERCISE. The Conversion Right may be exercised by the
     holder by the surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the
     Company together with a written statement (which may be in the form of
     EXHIBIT A-1 or EXHIBIT A-2 hereto) specifying that the holder thereby
     intends to exercise the Conversion Right and indicating the number of
     shares subject to this Warrant which are being surrendered (referred to in
     Section 10.2(a) hereof as the Converted Warrant Shares) in exercise of the
     Conversion Right. Such conversion shall be effective upon receipt by the
     Company of this Warrant together with the aforesaid written statement, or
     on such later date as is specified therein (the "CONVERSION DATE"), and, at
     the election of the holder hereof, may be made contingent upon the closing
     of the sale of the Company's Common Stock to the public in a public
     offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Act (a "PUBLIC
     OFFERING"). Certificates for the shares issuable upon exercise of the
     Conversion Right and, if applicable, a new warrant evidencing the balance
     of the shares remaining subject to this Warrant, shall be issued as of the
     Conversion Date and shall be delivered to the holder within thirty (30)
     days following the Conversion Date.

          (c) DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE. For purposes of this Section
     10.2, "fair market value" of a share of Common Stock as of a particular
     date (the "DETERMINATION DATE") shall mean:

               (i) If the Conversion Right is exercised in connection with and
          contingent upon a Public Offering, and if the Company's Registration
          Statement relating to such Public Offering ("REGISTRATION STATEMENT")
          has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
          then the initial "Price to Public" specified in the final prospectus
          with respect to such offering.

               (ii) If the Conversion Right is not exercised in connection with
          and contingent upon a Public Offering, then as follows:

                    (A) If traded on a securities exchange, the fair market
               value of the Common Stock shall be deemed to be the average of
               the closing prices of the Common Stock on such exchange over the
               five trading days immediately prior to the Determination Date;

                    (B) If traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market or other
               over-the-counter system, the fair market value of the Common
               Stock shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices
               of the Common Stock over the five trading days immediately prior
               to the Determination Date; and

                    (C) If there is no public market for the Common Stock, then
               fair market value shall be reasonably determined by the Company's
               Board of Directors.

     If closing prices or closing bid prices are no longer reported by a
securities exchange or other trading system, the closing price or closing bid
price shall be that which is reported by such securities exchange or other
trading system at 4:00 p.m. New York City time on the applicable trading day.

                                    EXHIBIT D

                FORM OF OPINION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COUNSEL


Re:  Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Dear Sirs:

We represent Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("the Company") in connection with
the issued patents and pending patent applications listed in Exhibit A, issued
trademark registrations and pending trademark applications listed in Exhibit B,
and related intellectual property matters. This letter, issued at the Company's
request, is limited accordingly.

a.   We have disclosed or at all relevant times intended and intend to disclose
     to the United States Patent and Trademark Office any references known by us
     to be material to the patentability of the claimed inventions of the United
     States patent applications of the Company being prosecuted by us and listed
     on Exhibit A in a manner that satisfies 37 C.F.R. ss. 1.56.

b.   All patents and applications that are being or have been prosecuted by us
     relating to RNA interference (RNAi) processes mediated by small interfering
     nucleic acid (siNA, including siRNA) molecules (collectively, RNAi
     technology), as identified on Exhibit C, have been assigned to the Company,
     or the inventors on such patents or patent applications have been
     represented to us as being employees of the Company under an obligation to
     assign their rights in such patents or patent applications to the Company.
     To the best of our knowledge, all of the remaining patents, trademarks, and
     applications being prosecuted by us and listed on Exhibit A and Exhibit B
     either have been assigned or licensed to the Company, or one or more
     inventors on such patents or patent applications are under an obligation to
     assign their rights in such patents or patent applications to the Company
     or to the Company's licensor.

c.   But for the exceptions noted below, we have not, within the last one-year
     period, received any written notice from a third party challenging
     ownership, validity, or enforceability of any patent or trademark of the
     Company. Moreover, but for the exceptions noted below, we have not, within
     the last one-year period, received any information from the Company
     regarding any written notice from a third party challenging ownership,
     validity, or enforceability of any patent or trademark of the Company. As
     to the subject matter of the siNA applications identified in Exhibit C, and
     but for the exceptions noted below, we have not received and we are not
     aware of the Company having received any notice from any third party
     charging patent infringement or challenging the ownership, validity, or
     enforceability of the Company's position.

     Exceptions: (i) a potential interference proceeding in the U.S. Patent and
     Trademark Office against Hybridon; (ii) a pending re-examination proceeding
     filed by a third party in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office against one
     of the Company's Inbound License Agreement Patents; (iii) an opposition
     proceeding in the European Patent Office against one of the Company's
     Inbound License Agreement Patents; (iv) a pending opposition proceeding
     filed by the Company in the European Patent Office against a third-party
     patent application; (v) a possible opposition proceeding being contemplated
     by the Company in the European Patent Office against a third-party patent
     application; and (vi) pending opposition proceedings have been filed by two
     companies, Klinge Pharma and Sofex, against the Company's application to
     obtain trademark registration in the European Community for the mark,
     "Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc."

     We understand that the Company has disclosed the exceptions noted above.

d.   We have not, within the last one-year period, received any written notice
     threatening litigation against the Company for infringement with respect to
     any patent, trademark, or copyright, or threatening litigation for unfair
     competition or misappropriation of trade secret. Moreover, we have not,
     within the last one-year period, received any information from the Company
     regarding any written notice, received by the Company, threatening
     litigation against the Company for infringement with respect to any patent,
     trademark, or copyright, or threatening litigation for unfair competition
     or misappropriation of trade secret. However, the Company has advised us of
     prior communications with Anjinomoto (Japan) and Gene Shears (Australia),
     which situations have been disclosed by the Company to our understanding,
     and we note the general exceptions listed above.

e.   We do not represent the Company in connection with pending litigation
     against the Company concerning patent infringement, trademark infringement,
     copyright infringement, unfair competition, or misappropriation of trade
     secret. Moreover, we are not aware of pending litigation against the
     Company concerning patent infringement, trademark infringement, copyright
     infringement, unfair competition, or misappropriation of trade secret.
     However we note the general exceptions listed above.

f.   To the best of our knowledge, based on the information given to us to date
     by the Company about the Company's processes and the conduct of its
     business, we are not presently aware of any situation in which the
     Company's processes or the conduct of its business are violating any
     patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights
     of a third party. To the extent we have considered any specific aspect of
     the Company's processes or its business in relation to a specific patent,
     trademark, or copyright of a third party, we have not issued any opinion
     that is adverse to the Company and would, in our judgment, materially and
     adversely impact the Company's business. Specifically as to RNAi
     technology, we previously reviewed the published patent applications
     identified in Exhibit D; under U.S. law, we believe the claims presented in
     these published patent applications did not literally claim a product that
     completely lacks any naturally occurring ribonucleotide. We also note the
     general exceptions listed above.

g.   We are not aware of any outstanding order, judgment, decree, or stipulation
     issued by a court or agency of any United States governmental unit that
     materially restricts the use, sale, transfer, assignment or licensing of
     the patent or trademark rights or that materially restricts the current
     business activities of the Company. The Company has not advised us as to
     any outstanding order, judgment, decree, or stipulation issued by a court
     or agency of any United States governmental unit that materially restricts
     the use, sale, transfer, assignment or licensing of the patent or trademark
     rights or that materially restricts the current business activities of the
     Company.

h.   To our knowledge, the Company has communicated with numerous organizations,
     directly or indirectly, regarding a potential license for those
     organizations under certain patent rights of the Company. The Company has
     also previously communicated with a third party company regarding possible
     infringement of one of the Company's trademarks. To our knowledge, the
     Company has brought no legal action for patent or trademark infringement
     against any such organization within the past year.

i.   We note that certain patents, trademarks, and applications identified in
     Exhibits A and B were handled in whole or in part by the Company's prior
     law firms, and we have limited knowledge with respect to such matters. In
     addition, we note that we have been instructed by the Company to abandon
     certain patents and patent applications that may not pertain to the
     Company's future focus of operation, and Exhibits A and B may not reflect
     these instructions in their entirety.

j.   We note that we have prepared this letter at the request of the Company in
     the belief and understanding that a community of interests exists between
     your clients and the Company. Be advised that, by permitting us to respond
     as set forth herein, the Company does not waive and does not intend to
     waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to any information which
     the Company has furnished to us. Moreover, please be advised that our
     comments to you should not be construed in any way to constitute a waiver
     of the protection of the attorney-client privilege with respect to any of
     our work for the Company.

k.   This letter and the information contained herein are being provided to you
     solely in relation to the Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement
     (January 2003), and this letter is not to be quoted in whole or in part or
     otherwise referred to in any documents or notes, nor is it to be filed with
     any governmental agency or provided to other person without the prior
     written consent of our firm and the Company.

l.   We are the Company's U.S. counsel, and we represent only the Company in
     this matter. Third parties should obtain an opinion of their own counsel
     before making business or investment decisions in relation to this matter.

                                    EXHIBIT E

             FORM OF NON-COMPETITION and NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT


          This Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this "AGREEMENT")
is entered into as of February ____, 2003, by and among Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY") and
_______________, an individual ("EMPLOYEE").

                                    RECITALS

          The Company is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of
researching, developing, manufacturing, licensing, selling, and distributing
therapeutics and diagnostic technologies using nucleotides and oligonucleotides
(such business being collectively referred to herein as the "BUSINESS").

          From and after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement (as defined below), the Company proposes that its principal
business activities shall relate to the research, development, manufacture,
license, sale and distribution of therapeutic products using siRNA technology
(hereinafter, "siRNA TECHNOLOGY"). During the Non-Competition Period (as
hereinafter defined), the Company may, in addition to or in substitution for
siRNA Technology, have additional platform technologies as its principal
business activity or activities, including without limitation programs [USING
SUCH PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES] [PRECEDING BRACKETED PHRASE TO BE DELETED FOR
HOWARD, MARVIN AND NASSIM] in therapeutic areas where the Company has advanced a
product into pre-clinical toxicology or later stages of development (the "FIELD
OF INTEREST"). For example, the current Field of Interest would include without
limitation the viruses HBV and HCV and the therapeutic gene target VEGF-Receptor
R-1, which are within the scope of the Company's current principal business
activities, but other therapeutic areas, such as anti-viral therapeutic products
and specific cancer therapeutics, would exceed the scope of activities covered
by the current Field of Interest.

          Employee is one of the Company's key employees, an executive officer
of the Company, and a member of the Company's management team. Employee
acknowledges that he has detailed knowledge of the Intellectual Property and
other confidential and proprietary information of the Company.

          Pursuant to the Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement dated as
of February ___, 2003 by and among the Company and the Investors listed on
Exhibit A thereto (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Company will issue securities to the
Investors. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth
herein or, if not defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
the Purchase Agreement.

          Employee has considered the effects of this Agreement, consider them
reasonable and, in order to induce the Investors to enter into the Purchase
Agreement and to enter into or consent to the transactions contemplated thereby
(including without limitation the Employment Agreement between the Employee and
the Company dated as of the date hereof (the "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT"), which
agreement would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Purchase Agreement),
and in order to obtain the privileges, protections, and benefits of the
Employment Agreement, Employee has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, Employee and the Company,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                 NON-COMPETITION

          1.1 NON-COMPETITION. As an inducement for the Investors to enter into
the Purchase Agreement and to enter into or consent to the transactions
contemplated thereby, and in order to obtain the privileges, protections, and
benefits of the Employment Agreement, Employee agrees that from and after the
effective date of the Purchase Agreement (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") and until two
and one-half (2 1/2) years thereafter (the "NON-COMPETITION PERIOD");

               (a) Employee shall not, anywhere in the United States, engage,
without the express prior written consent of the Company, in any business or
activity in direct competition with Company in the then current Field of
Interest, whether as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, agent,
representative, equity holder or in any other individual, corporate or
representative capacity (without limitation by specific enumeration of the
foregoing), or render any services or provide any advice to any business,
activity or Person in direct competition with the Company in the then current
Field of Interest (a "COMPETING BUSINESS").

               (b) Employee shall not, anywhere in Colorado, engage, without the
express prior written consent of the Company, in any business or activity in
direct competition with the Company in the then current Field of Interest,
whether as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, agent, representative,
equity holder or in any other individual, corporate or representative capacity
(without limitation by specific enumeration of the foregoing), or render any
services or provide any advice to any Competing Business.

               (c) Employee shall not, in any of the counties in the State of
Colorado, engage, without the express prior written consent of the Company, in
any business or activity in direct competition with the Company in the then
current Field of Interest, whether as an employee, consultant, partner,
principal, agent, representative, equity holder or in any other individual,
corporate or representative capacity (without limitation by specific enumeration
of the foregoing), or render any services or provide any advice to any Competing
Business.

          1.2 LIMITATION ON PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Employee's employment with the
Company terminates for any reason prior to the end of the Non-Competition
Period, Employee may thereafter engage, without the consent of the Company, in
any business or activity, whether as an employee, consultant, partner,
principal, agent, representative, equity holder or in any other individual,
corporate or representative capacity (without limitation by specific enumeration
of the foregoing) for a Person that is engaged in the then current Field of
Interest at the time of termination of Employee's employment with the Company,
so long as (i) the principal business activity of such Person is not in such
Field of Interest and (ii) Employee does not personally engage or provide
counsel, advice, or direction in any activities that are within such Field of
Interest for such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, Employee may become a
senior executive for a Person that is engaged in such Field of Interest and may
have employees reporting to him that are engaged in such Field of Interest, so
long as Employee does not personally engage directly or directly provide
counsel, advice or direction in any activities that are within such Field of
Interest.

          1.3 PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Employee may own, directly or indirectly, up to one percent (1%) of any class of
"publicly traded securities" of any Person which owns or operates a business
that is a Competing Business. For the purposes of this SECTION 1.3, "publicly
traded securities" shall mean securities that are traded on a national
securities exchange or listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

          1.4 NO INTERFERENCE WITH THE BUSINESS; NON-SOLICITATION. As an
inducement for the Investors to enter into the Purchase Agreement, Employee
agrees that, during the Non-Competition Period, Employee shall not for any
reason intentionally or knowingly or willfully (a) with respect to the Business,
solicit or divert any business, clients, customers, or partners made known to
Employee during his employment with the Company away from the Company, (b)
induce customers, clients, partners, suppliers, agents or other Persons under
contract or otherwise associated or doing business with the Company who are made
known to Employee during his employment with the Company to reduce or alter any
such association or business with the Company, and/or (c) solicit any Person in
the employment of the Company to (i) terminate such employment, and/or (ii)
accept employment, or enter into any consulting arrangement, with any Person
other than the Company.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                    REMEDIES

          2.1 REMEDIES. The parties to this Agreement agree that (i) if Employee
materially breaches ARTICLE 1 of this Agreement, the damage to the Company may
be substantial, although difficult to ascertain, and money damages will not
afford the Company an adequate remedy, and (ii) if Employee is in breach of any
provision of this Agreement, or threatens a breach of this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies as may
be provided by law, to seek specific performance and injunctive and other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or restrain
a breach of any provision of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                              TERM AND TERMINATION


          3.1 TERM. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date, and
shall terminate at the end of the Non-Competition Period; provided, that this
Agreement shall terminate and be of no force or effect in the event that the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are not consummated for any
reason.

                                   ARTICLE 4

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          4.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS; SEVERAL AGREEMENTS. This
Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, with
respect thereto. This Agreement may be amended or modified and the terms and
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of
the parties or, in the case of waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay
on the part of either party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of
either party of any right, power or privilege hereunder, nor any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that either party may otherwise have
at law or in equity. In addition to this Agreement between the Company and
Employee, the Company has entered into a similar agreement with other key
employees of the Company. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement and the
obligations of the parties hereunder are to be construed separately from any
similar agreements with any other employee of the Company and a breach of a
similar agreement by any other employee of the Company shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement. No waiver by the Company of any term or condition of
this Agreement with respect to Employee, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition
of any other agreement with respect to any other employee of the Company or any
other Person.

          4.2 NOTICES. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder
must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given only if delivered
personally against written receipt or by facsimile transmission against
facsimile confirmation or dispatched by nationally recognized overnight courier
prepaid, to the respective parties at the following addresses or facsimile
numbers:

               If to the Company:      Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
                                       2950 Wilderness Place
                                       Boulder, CO 80301
                                       Attn:    General Counsel
                                       Fax:  (303) 449-6995

               If to Employee:         To the address or facsimile number for
                                       notice set forth on the last page hereof.

All such notices, requests and other communications will (a) if
delivered personally to the address as provided in this section, be deemed given
upon delivery, (b) if delivered by facsimile transmission to the facsimile
number as provided for in this section, be deemed given upon facsimile
confirmation, and (c) if delivered by overnight courier to the address as
provided in this section, be deemed given on the earlier of the first Business
Day following the date deposited with such overnight courier with the requisite
payment and instructions to effect delivery on the next business day or upon
receipt (in each case regardless of whether such notice, request or other
communication is received by any other Person to whom a copy of such notice is
to be delivered pursuant to this section). Any party from time to time may
change its address, facsimile number or other information for the purpose of
notices to that party by giving notice specifying such change to the other
parties hereto.

          4.3 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Colorado, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Colorado or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Colorado.

          4.4 PURCHASE AGREEMENT. In the event the Purchase Agreement is not
consummated or is terminated for any reason (other than a breach of this
Agreement) in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be null and void.

          4.5 SEVERABILITY. To the extent any provision of this Agreement shall
be determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part,
such determination shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to carry
out its provisions to the greatest extent possible. In the absence of such
reformation, such part of such provision shall be considered deleted from this
Agreement and the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be
unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, should the duration or geographical extent of,
or business activities covered by any provision of this Agreement be in excess
of that which is valid and enforceable under applicable law, then such provision
shall be construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities which may
validly and enforceably be covered. To the extent any provision of this
Agreement shall be declared invalid or unenforceable for any reason by any
Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction, this Agreement (or provision thereof)
shall remain valid and enforceable in each other jurisdiction where it applies.
Employee acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly
stipulates that this Agreement shall be given the construction which renders its
provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its
express terms) possible under applicable law.

          4.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, the heirs and legal representatives
of Employee and the successors and assigns of the Company. Employee shall not be
entitled to assign his obligations hereunder. The Company may assign its rights
under this Agreement to successors and assigns of the Company that succeed to
all or substantially all of that portion of the Company's business to which the
employment of Employee principally relates. Employee agrees that, upon request
therefor, Employee will, in writing, acknowledge and consent to any such
assignment of this Agreement.

          4.7 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. To Employee's knowledge, Employee
represents and warrants that this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against Employee in accordance with its terms to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable federal, state or local law.

          4.8 EFFECTIVE TIME. This Agreement shall become effective upon the
closing of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

          4.9 INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND ADVICE. Employee represents and warrants
that Employee has carefully read this Agreement; that Employee executes this
Agreement with full knowledge of the contents of this Agreement, the legal
consequences thereof, and any and all rights which each party may have with
respect to one another; that Employee has had the opportunity to receive
independent legal advice with respect to the matters set forth in this Agreement
and with respect to the rights and asserted rights arising out of such matters;
that Employee has been advised to, and has had the opportunity to, consult with
Employee's personal attorney prior to entering into this Agreement; and that
Employee is entering into this Agreement of Employee's own free will. Employee
expressly agrees that he or she has no expectations or understandings contrary
to the Agreement and no usage of trade or regular practice in the industry shall
be used to modify this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement shall
not be construed for or against either party in any interpretation thereof.
Employee acknowledges that Sills Cummis Radin Tischman Epstein & Gross P.A. and
Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP represent the Company and do not represent
Employee in connection with this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby.


          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Agreement effective as of the date first written above.

respects as of such date), except in each case, or in the aggregate, in which
breaches of any one or more representations and warranties would not, or would
not reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect,

                       FORM OF INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement (the "AGREEMENT") is entered into as of the
___ day of _________, 2003, by and among ____________________, a Delaware
corporation (the "COMPANY") and the indemnitees listed on the signature pages
hereto (each an "INDEMNITEE" and collectively, the "INDEMNITEES").

                                    RECITALS

     A. The Company and the Indemnitees recognize the continued difficulty in
obtaining liability insurance for the Company's directors, officers, employees,
controlling persons, agents and fiduciaries, the significant increases in the
cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such
insurance.

     B. The Company and the Indemnitees further recognize the substantial
increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers,
employees, controlling persons, agents and fiduciaries to expensive litigation
risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance
has been severely limited.

     C. The Indemnitees do not regard the prior protection available as adequate
under the circumstances, and the Indemnitees and other directors, officers,
employees, controlling persons, agents and fiduciaries of the Company are not
willing to serve in such capacities without additional protection, so the
Company and the Indemnitees desire to enter into this Agreement.

     D. The Company (i) desires to attract and retain the involvement of highly
qualified groups, such as the Indemnitees, to serve the Company and, in part, to
induce each Indemnitee to be involved with the Company and (ii) wishes to
provide for the indemnification and advancing of expenses to each Indemnitee to
the maximum extent permitted by law.

     E. In view of the considerations set forth above, the Company desires that
each Indemnitee be indemnified by the Company as set forth herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and each Indemnitee hereby agrees as
     follows:

          1. INDEMNIFICATION.

               a. INDEMNIFICATION OF EXPENSES. The Company shall indemnify and
          hold harmless each Indemnitee (including, without limitation, its
          respective directors, officers, partners, employees, agents and
          spouses) and each person who controls any of them or who may be liable
          within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
          amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), or Section 20 of the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT") to the fullest
          extent permitted by law if such Indemnitee was or is or becomes a
          party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be
          made a party to or witness or other participant in, any threatened,
          pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute
          resolution mechanism, or any hearing, inquiry or investigation that
          such Indemnitee reasonably believes might lead to the institution of
          any such action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution
          mechanism, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
          other (hereinafter a "CLAIM") by reason of (or arising in part out of)
          any event or occurrence related to the fact that such Indemnitee is or
          was a director, officer, employee, controlling person, agent or
          fiduciary of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, or is or
          was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
          employee, controlling person, agent or fiduciary of another
          corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
          by reason of any action or inaction on the part of such Indemnitee
          while serving in such capacity including, without limitation, any and
          all losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities, joint or
          several (including, without limitation, any investigation, legal and
          other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in
          settlement of, any action, suit, proceeding or any claim asserted)
          under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state
          statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, which relate
          directly or indirectly to the registration, purchase, sale or
          ownership of any securities of the Company or to any fiduciary
          obligation owed with respect thereto (hereinafter an "INDEMNIFICATION
          EVENT") against any and all expenses (including, without limitation,
          reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
          and obligations incurred in connection with investigating, defending a
          witness in or participating in (including, without limitation, on
          appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in,
          any such action, suit, proceeding, alternative dispute resolution
          mechanism, hearing, inquiry or investigation), judgments, fines,
          penalties and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is
          approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be
          unreasonably withheld) of such Claim and any federal, state, local or
          foreign taxes imposed on such Indemnitee as a result of the actual or
          deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement (collectively,
          hereinafter "EXPENSES"), including, without limitation, all interest,
          assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in
          respect of such Expenses. Such payment of allowed Expenses shall be
          made by the Company as soon as practicable but in any event no later
          than five (5) days after written demand by the Indemnitee therefor is
          presented to the Company.

               b. REVIEWING PARTY. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
          obligations of the Company under Section 1(a) shall be subject to the
          condition that the Reviewing Party (as described in Section 10(e)
          hereof) shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case
          in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section 10(d)
          hereof is involved) that an Indemnitee would not be permitted to be
          indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) each Indemnitee
          acknowledges and agrees that the obligation of the Company to make an
          advance payment of Expenses to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 2(a)
          (an "EXPENSE ADVANCE") shall be subject to the condition that, if,
          when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines that an
          Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under
          applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by such
          Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such
          amounts theretofore paid; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such Indemnitee
          has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of
          competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that such Indemnitee
          should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by
          the Reviewing Party that such Indemnitee would not be permitted to be
          indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and such
          Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any
          Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with
          respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been
          exhausted or lapsed). An Indemnitee's obligation to reimburse the
          Company for any Expense Advance shall be unsecured and no interest
          shall be charged thereon if such reimbursement is made within thirty
          (30) days of such final judicial determination, unless otherwise
          required by the court. If there has not been a Change in Control (as
          defined in Section 10(c) hereof), the Reviewing Party shall be
          selected by the Board of Directors, and if there has been such a
          Change in Control (other than a Change in Control that has been
          approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were
          directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the Reviewing
          Party shall be the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section
          10(d) hereof. If there has been no determination by the Reviewing
          Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that an Indemnitee
          substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in
          part under applicable law, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
          commence litigation seeking an initial determination by the court or
          challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any
          aspect thereof, including, without limitation, the legal or factual
          bases therefor, and the Company hereby consents to service of process
          and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the
          Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the
          Company and such Indemnitee.

               c. CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in Section
          1(a) above for any reason is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
          to be unavailable to an Indemnitee in respect of any losses, claims,
          damages, expenses or liabilities referred to therein, then the
          Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee thereunder, shall
          contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a
          result of such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (i) in
          such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
          received by the Company and the Indemnitees, or (ii) if the allocation
          provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in
          such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
          benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault
          of the Company and the Indemnitees in connection with the action or
          inaction that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or
          liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          In connection with the registration of the Company's securities, the
          relative benefits received by the Company and the Indemnitees shall be
          deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the net proceeds
          from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
          and the Indemnitees, in each case as set forth in the table on the
          cover page of the applicable prospectus, bear to the aggregate public
          offering price of the securities so offered. The relative fault of the
          Company and the Indemnitees shall be determined by reference to, among
          other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
          material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material
          fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Indemnitees
          and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
          opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

               The Company and the Indemnitees agree that it would not be just
          and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 1(c) were
          determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method
          of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
          considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. In
          connection with the registration of the Company's securities, in no
          event shall an Indemnitee be required to contribute any amount under
          this Section 1(c) in excess of the lesser of (i) that proportion of
          the total of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities that are
          indemnified against, equal to the proportion of the total securities
          sold under such registration statement that are being sold by such
          Indemnitee or (ii) the proceeds received by such Indemnitee from its
          sale of securities under such registration statement. No person found
          guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
          11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
          any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent
          misrepresentation.

               d. SURVIVAL REGARDLESS OF INVESTIGATION. The indemnification and
          contribution provided for in this Section 1 will remain in full force
          and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
          Indemnitees or any officer, director, employee, agent or controlling
          person of the Indemnitees.

               e. CHANGE IN CONTROL. The Company agrees that if there is a
          Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control that
          has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors
          who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then,
          with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights
          of the Indemnitees to payments of Expenses under this Agreement or any
          other agreement or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or
          Bylaws as now or hereafter in effect, Independent Legal Counsel (as
          defined in Section 10(d) hereof) shall be selected by the Indemnitees
          and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably
          withheld). Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written
          opinion to the Company and the Indemnitees as to whether and to what
          extent the Indemnitees would be permitted to be indemnified under
          applicable law. The Company agrees to abide by such opinion and to pay
          the reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above
          and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses
          (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), claims,
          liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement
          or its engagement pursuant hereto.

               f. MANDATORY PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. Notwithstanding any other
          provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitees have
          been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without
          limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in the
          defense of any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
          referred to in Section 1(a) hereof or in the defense of any claim,
          issue or matter therein, each Indemnitee shall be indemnified against
          all Expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in connection herewith.

          2. EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.

               a. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. The Company shall advance all
          Expenses incurred by the Indemnitees. The advances to be made
          hereunder shall be paid by the Company to the Indemnitees as soon as
          practicable but in any event no later than five (5) days after written
          demand by such Indemnitees therefor to the Company.

               b. NOTICE/COOPERATION BY THE INDEMNITEES. Each Indemnitee shall
          give the Company notice in writing as soon as practicable of any Claim
          made against such Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could
          be sought under this Agreement. Notice to the Company shall be
          directed to the Company's Chief Executive Officer at the Company's
          address (or such other address as the Company shall designate in
          writing to the Indemnitees).

               c. NO PRESUMPTIONS; BURDEN OF PROOF. For purposes of this
          Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement
          (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea
          of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption
          that the Indemnitees did not meet any particular standard of conduct
          or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
          indemnification is not permitted by applicable law. In addition,
          neither the failure of the Reviewing Party to have made a
          determination as to whether an Indemnitee has met any particular
          standard of conduct or had any particular belief, nor an actual
          determination by the Reviewing Party that an Indemnitee has not met
          such standard of conduct or did not have such belief, prior to the
          commencement of legal proceedings by such Indemnitee to secure a
          judicial determination that such Indemnitee should be indemnified
          under applicable law, shall be a defense to an Indemnitee's claim or
          create a presumption that such Indemnitee has not met any particular
          standard of conduct or did not have any particular belief. In
          connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise
          as to whether an Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder,
          the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that an
          Indemnitee is not so entitled.

               d. NOTICE TO INSURERS. If, at the time of the receipt by the
          Company of a notice of a Claim pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, the
          Company has liability insurance in effect that may cover such Claim,
          the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Claim
          to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in each of
          the policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or
          desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the
          Indemnitees, all amounts payable as a result of such action, suit,
          proceeding, inquiry or investigation in accordance with the terms of
          such policies.

               e. SELECTION OF COUNSEL. In the event the Company shall be
          obligated hereunder to pay the Expenses of any Claim, the Company
          shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Claim, with counsel
          approved by the applicable Indemnitee, upon the delivery to such
          Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so. After delivery
          of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
          retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be
          liable to such Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel
          subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee with respect to the same
          Claim; PROVIDED that, (i) the Indemnitee shall have the right to
          employ such Indemnitee's counsel in any such Claim at the Indemnitee's
          expense and (ii) if (A) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee
          has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) such Indemnitee
          shall have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest
          between the Company and such Indemnitee in the conduct of any such
          defense, or (C) the Company shall not continue to retain such counsel
          to defend such Claim, then the fees and expenses of the Indemnitee's
          counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall have
          the right to conduct such defense as it sees fit in its sole
          discretion, including, without limitation, the right to settle any
          claim against any Indemnitee without the consent of such Indemnitee.

          3. ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS; NONEXCLUSIVITY.

               a. SCOPE. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Indemnitees
          to the fullest extent permitted by law, even if such indemnification
          is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this
          Agreement, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's
          Bylaws or by statute. In the event of any change after the date of
          this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or rule that expands the
          right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of
          Directors or an officer, employee, controlling person, agent or
          fiduciary, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitees
          shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits afforded by such
          change. In the event of any change after the date of this Agreement in
          any applicable law, statute or rule that narrows the right of a
          Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of Directors
          or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, such change, to the
          extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be
          applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or
          the parties' rights and obligations hereunder except as set forth in
          Section 8(a) hereof.

               b. NONEXCLUSIVITY. The indemnification provided by this Agreement
          shall be in addition to any rights to which the Indemnitees may be
          entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws,
          any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors,
          the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise. The
          indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to
          each Indemnitee for any action such Indemnitee took or did not take
          while serving in an indemnified capacity even though the Indemnitee
          may have ceased to serve in such capacity.

          4. NO DUPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. The Company shall not be liable under
     this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Claim made
     against any Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee has otherwise actually
     received payment (under any insurance policy, Certificate of Incorporation,
     Bylaw or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

          5. PARTIAL INDEMNIFICATION. If any Indemnitee is entitled under any
     provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for any
     portion of Expenses incurred in connection with any Claim, but not,
     however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall
     nevertheless indemnify such Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses to
     which such Indemnitee is entitled.

          6. MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. The Company and each Indemnitee acknowledge
     that in certain instances, Federal law or applicable public policy may
     prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors, officers, employees,
     controlling persons, agents or fiduciaries under this Agreement or
     otherwise. Each Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company
     has undertaken or may be required in the future to undertake with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission to submit the question of
     indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of
     the Company's rights under public policy to indemnify the Indemnitees.

          7. LIABILITY INSURANCE. To the extent the Company maintains liability
     insurance applicable to directors, officers, employees, control persons,
     agents or fiduciaries, each of the Indemnitees shall be covered by such
     policies in such a manner as to provide the Indemnitees the same rights and
     benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's
     directors, if such Indemnitee is a director, or of the Company's officers,
     if such Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer; or
     of the Company's key employees, controlling persons, agents or fiduciaries,
     if such Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee,
     agent, control person, or fiduciary.

          8. EXCEPTIONS. Any other provision herein to the contrary
     notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms
     of this Agreement:

               a. CLAIMS INITIATED BY AN INDEMNITEE. To indemnify or advance
          expenses to any Indemnitee with respect to Claims initiated or brought
          voluntarily by such Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except (i)
          with respect to actions or proceedings to establish or enforce a right
          to indemnify under this Agreement or any other agreement or insurance
          policy or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
          now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable
          Events, (ii) in specific cases if the Board of Directors has approved
          the initiation or bringing of such Claim, or (iii) as otherwise
          required under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
          regardless of whether such Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be
          entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance
          recovery, as the case may be; or

               b. CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 16(B). To indemnify any Indemnitee for
          expenses and the payment of profits arising from the purchase and sale

          10. CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN PHRASES.

               a. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "COMPANY"
          shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
          constituent corporation (including, without limitation, any
          constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger
          that, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power
          and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees, agents
          or fiduciaries, so that if an Indemnitee is or was a director,
          officer, employee, agent, control person, or fiduciary of such
          constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
          constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, control
          person, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
          venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, each
          Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
          this Agreement with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation
          as each Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent
          corporation if its separate existence had continued.

               b. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "OTHER
          ENTERPRISES" shall include, without limitation, employee benefit
          plans; references to "FINES" shall include, without limitation, any
          excise taxes assessed on any Indemnitee with respect to an employee
          benefit plan; and references to "SERVING AT THE REQUEST OF THE

          agent or fiduciary of the Company that imposes duties on, or involves
          services by, such director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary with
          respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or its
          beneficiaries; and if any Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a
          manner such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the interest of
          the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, such
          Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "NOT OPPOSED TO
          THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY" as referred to in this Agreement.

               c. For purposes of this Agreement a "CHANGE IN CONTROL" shall be
          deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in
          Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than a
          trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee
          benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or
          indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the
          same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, (A) who
          is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
          securities of the Company representing ten percent (10%) or more of
          the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting
          Securities (as defined in Section 10(f) hereof), increases his
          beneficial ownership of such securities by five percent (5%) or more
          over the percentage so owned by such person, or (B) becomes the
          "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Exchange Act),
          directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more
          than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power represented by the
          Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, (ii) during any period
          of two (2) consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such
          period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new
          director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for
          election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at
          least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who
          either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election
          or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
          reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of
          the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any
          other corporation other than a merger or consolidation that would
          result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately
          prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding
          or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity)
          at least eighty percent (80%) of the total voting power represented by
          the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity
          outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the
          stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of
          the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company
          of (in one transaction or a series of transactions) all or
          substantially all of the Company's assets.

          shall mean an attorney or firm of attorneys, selected in accordance
          with the provisions of Section 2(e) hereof, who shall not have

          concerning the right of any Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of
          other indemnitees under similar indemnity agreements).

     generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
     prospectively) only with the written consent of (a) the Company; and (b)
     each Indemnitee, if any, adversely affected by such amendment. Any
     amendment so effected shall be binding upon the Company and all Indemnitees
     and all of their respective successors and assigns whether or not such
     person or entity entered into or approved such amendment or waiver. The
     observance of any term hereof may be waived by a party with respect to its
     own interests (either generally or in a particular instance and either
     retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the party
     so waiving the observance of such term. In no event shall such waiver of
     any rights hereunder constitute the waiver of such rights in any future
     instance unless the waiver so specifies in writing. Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may add additional
     Indemnitees at any time to this Agreement without the consent of any other
     Indemnitee.

     incurred by such Indemnitee with respect to such action, regardless of
     whether such Indemnitee is ultimately successful in such action, and shall
     be entitled to the advancement of Expenses with respect to such action,
     unless, as a part of such action, a court of competent jurisdiction over
     such action determines that each of the material assertions made by such
     Indemnitee as a basis for such action was not made in good faith or was
     frivolous. In the event of an action instituted by or in the name of the
     Company under this Agreement to enforce or interpret any of the terms of
     this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all Expenses
     incurred by such Indemnitee in defense of such action (including, without
     limitation, costs and expenses incurred with respect to such Indemnitee's
     counterclaims and cross-claims made in such action), and shall be entitled
     to the advancement of Expenses with respect to such action, unless, as a
     part of such action, a court having jurisdiction over such action
     determines that each of such Indemnitee's material defenses to such action
     was made in bad faith or was frivolous.

          13. BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
     the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
     respective successors, assigns, including, without limitation, any direct
     or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to
     all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company,
     spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives.

          14. CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and its
     provisions construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
     of Delaware, as applied to contracts between Delaware residents, entered
     into and to be performed entirely within the State of Delaware, without
     regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

          15. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. The Company and each Indemnitee each
     hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State
     of Delaware for all purposes in connection with any action or proceeding
     that arises out of or relates to this Agreement and agree that any action
     instituted under this Agreement shall be commenced, prosecuted and
     continued only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for

     hereof between the parties hereto.

     hereunder shall be in writing, shall be effective when given, and shall in

          21. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable
     in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including, without
     limitation, any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence)
     are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
     otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain
     enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Furthermore, to the
     fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including,
     without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision
     held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself

     Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
     rights of recovery of an Indemnitee who shall execute all documents
     required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure such rights
     and to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          23. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The Company shall require and cause any
     successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or
     otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the
     business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and
     substance satisfactory to each Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to
     perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
     Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
     This Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to Claims relating to
     Indemnifiable Events regardless of whether any Indemnitee continues to
     serve as a director, officer, employee, agent, controlling person, or
     fiduciary of the Company or of any other enterprise, including, without
     limitation, subsidiaries of the Company, at the Company's request.

Dear Howard:

     This letter shall serve to amend and restate the terms of employment
offered to you by Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") and acknowledge
your acceptance of the employment on such terms as detailed below. This letter
is being entered into in connection with the proposed private venture capital
financing in the approximate amount of $45 million for the Company (the
"Financing"), and shall become effective upon the closing of the Financing and
the transactions contemplated thereby (the "Effective Time"). Until the
Effective Time, your current employment letter agreement dated January 4, 2001,
as amended on June 19, 2001 and June 24, 2002 (collectively, the "Current
Agreement") shall remain in full force and effect.

     Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them on Appendix 1 hereto.

     1. POSITIONS AND SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT. Upon the Effective Time, you shall
continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. You
shall render such business and professional services in the performance of your
duties, consistent with your position within the Company, consistent with the
Bylaws of the Company and as shall reasonably be assigned to you by the
Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), and you shall report directly to the
Board. You shall perform your duties faithfully and to the best of your ability
and shall devote your full business efforts and time to the Company. The Company
agrees that you shall continue to be nominated and elected to the Board
throughout the term of your employment with the Company.

     2. COMPENSATION.

          (a) BASE SALARY; ANNUAL REVIEWS. During the period beginning as of the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2003, the Company shall pay to you as
compensation for your services a base salary at the annualized rate of $345,000
(the "Base Salary"). Thereafter, your Base Salary shall be subject to annual
performance review by the Board for appropriate upward adjustment, and you will
be considered for additional grants of stock options in connection with each
annual review by the Board. Your Base Salary shall be paid in accordance with
the Company's normal payroll practices.

          (b) BONUS. In each calendar year of your employment with the Company
you shall be eligible to earn a bonus, including the 2003 calendar year. The
annual bonus shall be based upon attainment of reasonable and achievable goals
which shall be mutually agreed upon by you and the Board. The amount of the
annual bonus which you shall be eligible to earn shall be equal to thirty
percent (30%) of your then current annual Base Salary in the event you achieve
such goals. Your bonus shall be reasonably increased or decreased based on the
overachievement or underachievement of such goals. Such bonus shall be payable
in a cash lump sum within thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar year
with respect to which the bonus is payable.

          (c) OPTIONS. On or before the date of signing of the Stock Purchase

fully converted basis, less 377,000 shares (which 377,000 shares have been
calculated based on the Company's current capitalization and before the proposed
reverse stock split, and will be considered a credit against the stock options
otherwise relating to four and one-half (4 1/2%) of the Company's issued and
outstanding common stock), which options shall be exercisable for a period of
ten (10) years at an exercise price equal to the greater of (i) the Fair Market

at the end of a period of five (5) years after the Effective Time). Each stock
option grant shall be in the form of incentive stock options in the maximum
amount permitted by applicable law. To the extent that any such stock option
grant shall be in the form of non-qualified stock options (either by initial
grant or by reason of any incentive stock options being disqualified as such),
you shall be permitted to exercise such non-qualified stock options for a period
of five (5) years following the termination of your employment for any reason;
provided, that if you are terminated for Cause (as defined below) you may
exercise such non-qualified stock options only during the ninety (90) day period

the Financing.

which reasonable opportunity shall in no event be less than thirty (30) days
following receipt of such notice.

     CHANGE OF CONTROL. "Change of Control" of the Company is defined as: (i)
any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented
by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or (ii) the consummation of
a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation that has
been approved by the stockholders of the Company, other than a merger or
consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company
outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power
represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity

of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company; or
(iii) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or

the directors still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or
whose election or nomination for election was previously approved, cease for any
reason to constitute a majority of the Board. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Financing in no event shall be deemed a Change of Control for the purposes of

benefits) as of the date of execution hereof, except to the extent that the
benefits of all other employees of the Company are similarly reduced; provided,
that regardless of whether the Company may similarly reduce the benefits of
other employees, it shall constitute Good Reason in the event the Company takes
any action which would adversely affect your participation in, or adversely
affect or reduce in any material aspect your benefits under, the Company's
medical, dental, short-term disability and/or long-term disability benefit plans
or arrangements; (iv) a relocation of your principal office to a location more
than thirty (30) miles from Boulder, Colorado, except for reasonable periods of

officer or director of the Company after the effective date thereof. In the
event that such waiver would constitute a material modification of the Loan
under the Act, your waiver hereunder shall have no force or effect, and you will
be entitled to all of your rights relating to the Loan under the Current
Agreement and this Agreement with respect to the Change of Control by reason of
the Financing.

                                   DEFINITIONS


     CAUSE. "Cause" is defined as (i) conviction of a felony crime involving
moral turpitude, (ii) an intentional action or intentional failure to act which
was performed in bad faith and to the material detriment of the Company, (iii)
continued intentional refusal or intentional failure to act in accordance with
any lawful and proper direction or order of the Board, (iv) willful and habitual
neglect of the duties of employment, or (v) breach of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that with respect to the
events of "cause" described under clauses (ii) through (v) above, the Company
shall have first provided to you written notice describing the nature of the
event and, thereafter, provided a reasonable opportunity to cure such event,
which reasonable opportunity shall in no event be less than thirty (30) days
following receipt of such notice.

     CHANGE OF CONTROL. "Change of Control" of the Company is defined as: (i)
any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented
by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or (ii) the consummation of
a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation that has
been approved by the stockholders of the Company, other than a merger or
consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company
outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power
represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity
outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders
of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company; or (iii)
the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or
substantially all the Company's assets; or (iv) when the individuals who on the
date hereof constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director
designated by a person or entity who has entered into an agreement to effect a
transaction described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above), whose nomination
and/or election to the Board was approved by a vote of at least a majority of
the directors still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or
whose election or nomination for election was previously approved, cease for any
reason to constitute a majority of the Board. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Financing in no event shall be deemed a Change of Control for the purposes of
this Agreement.

     GOOD REASON. "Good Reason" is defined as your voluntary resignation from
your employment with the Company upon the occurrence of any of the following
without your express written consent: (i) the assignment to you of any duties or
responsibilities inconsistent with the scope of the duties or responsibilities
associated with your titles or positions or any diminution to or adverse change
of your titles, positions, status or circumstances of employment; (ii) a
reduction by the Company in your Base Salary or bonus target percentage or,
absent a good business reason, of the facilities, benefits and perquisites
available to you immediately prior to such reduction; (iii) the taking of any
action by the Company which would adversely affect your participation in, or
reduce your benefits under, the Company's benefit plans (including equity
benefits) as of the date of execution hereof, except to the extent that the
benefits of all other employees of the Company are similarly reduced; provided,
that regardless of whether the Company may similarly reduce the benefits of
other employees, it shall constitute Good Reason in the event the Company takes
any action which would adversely affect your participation in, or adversely
affect or reduce in any material aspect your benefits under, the Company's
medical, dental, short-term disability and/or long-term disability benefit plans
or arrangements; (iv) a relocation of your principal office to a location more
than thirty (30) miles from Boulder, Colorado, except for reasonable periods of
required travel on Company business; (v) any breach by the Company of any
material provision of this Agreement; or (vi) any failure by the Company to
obtain the assumption of this Agreement in writing by any successor or assign of
the Company.
