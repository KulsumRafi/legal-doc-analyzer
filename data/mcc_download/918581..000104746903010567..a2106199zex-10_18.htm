<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of February&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2003, is made by and between CIBER, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the

"Executive"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to foster the continued employment of key management personnel; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and
questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management,
including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

tax planning services by a company providing such services, to the same extent as if the Executive had continued to be employed by the Company during such period. Benefits otherwise receivable by the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether
or not the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments, if any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection
with a Change in Control or the Executive's termination of employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Person whose
actions result in a Change in Control or any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) (all such payments and benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after
deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, and after taking into account the phase out of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i)&nbsp;all of the Total Payments
shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the Executive and
selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not
constitute parachute payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii)&nbsp;all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be
treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered
(within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii)&nbsp;the
value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of
determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the
Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of Termination (or if there
is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of this Section 6.2), net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained
from deduction of such state and local taxes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall
repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to
such reduction (plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the
Executive), to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of federal, state and
local income and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to
exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up
Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) within five
(5) business days following the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
payments provided in subsection (A) of Section 6.1 hereof and in Section 6.2 hereof shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination (or
if there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of Section 6.2 hereof); provided, however, that if the amounts of such payments cannot be
finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company or, in the case of payments under Section 6.2
hereof, in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments to which the Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest on
the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the extent the Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently
determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth (5th) business day after demand by the Company (together with interest at 120% of
the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code). Within fifteen (15) days prior to the time that payments are made under this Agreement, Tax Counsel shall provide the Company and the Executive
with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company also shall pay to the Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive (i)&nbsp;in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to
the termination of the Executive's employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement, provided that the Executive prevails in any material
dispute, or (ii)&nbsp;in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Such
payments shall be made within five (5) business days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company
reasonably may require. </FONT></P>

anything contained herein, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive the Severance Payments or any other payment or benefit hereunder unless he or
