acknowledges that the Company has outstanding debt in the principal amount of
One Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($175,000,000.00) plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon. This results in an enterprise value for the transaction
of Five Hundred and Fifty-Five Million Dollars ($555,000,000). On the Closing
Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Purchase Price, which shall be paid by
wire transfer to Seller of immediately available funds made to a bank account in
the United States of America designated in writing by Seller not less than three
business days before the Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Shares and the Membership Units in accordance with Schedule 1.2.

                  SECTION 1.3.      ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE

                  (a) Schedule 1.3 sets forth the Working Capital of the Company
as of June 30, 2002 (the "BASE STATEMENT") based on the Financial Statements.
"WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean Current Assets less Current Liabilities. "CURRENT
ASSETS" shall mean current assets of the Company as reflected in the financial
statements of the Company as of the relevant date of determination, but
excluding intercompany receivables (that is, receivables from the Seller and its
Affiliates), prepaid insurance and deferred taxes. "CURRENT LIABILITIES" shall
mean the current liabilities of the Company as reflected in the financial
statements of the Company as of the relevant date of determination, but
excluding intercompany payables (that is, payables to the Seller or any of its
Affiliates), the current portion of long-term debt, deferred taxes and accrued
liability for Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 4.10. Within
60 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
statement (the "CLOSING STATEMENT"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail
the amount of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date based upon a
balance sheet prepared as of the Closing Date on a basis consistent with the
balance sheet included in the Financial Statements and a calculation of the
adjustment to the Purchase Price that is payable based upon the difference
between the Working Capital in the Base Statement and the Working Capital in the
Closing Statement. Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to give Seller and its
authorized representatives reasonable access to such employees, officers and
other facilities and such books and records of the Company and the LLC as are
reasonably necessary to allow Seller and its authorized representatives to
prepare the Closing Statement. The Base Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with RAP (as defined in Section 2.7) and on a basis consistent with
the Financial

                                       2

<PAGE>

Statements using the same accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures
and adjustments as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with RAP and on a basis
consistent with the Financial Statements, using the same accounting methods,
policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were used in the preparation
of the Financial Statements and the Base Statement.

                  (b) Following its receipt from Seller of the Closing
Statement, Buyer shall have 10 days to review the Closing Statement and to
inform Seller in writing of any disagreement (the "OBJECTION") which it may have
with the Closing Statement, which objection shall specify in reasonable detail
Buyer's disagreement with the Closing Statement. If Seller does not receive the
Objection within such 10-day period, the amount of Working Capital set forth on
the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.3(a) shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Buyer and shall become binding upon Buyer. If Buyer does
timely deliver an Objection to Seller, Seller shall then have 10 days from the
date of receipt of such Objection (the "REVIEW PERIOD") to review and respond to
the Objection. Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the determination of Working Capital of the
Company as of the Closing Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price. If they are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to
the determination of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date or
the amount of the adjustment to the Purchase Price within 10 days following the
expiration of Seller's Review Period, they may refer, at the option of either
Buyer or Seller, their differences to KPMG LLP, or if KPMG LLP decline to accept
such engagement, an internationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants selected jointly by Buyer and Seller, who shall determine only with
respect to the differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the
amount of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date set forth in the
Closing Statement requires adjustment. If Buyer and Seller are unable to so
select the independent public accountants within five days of KPMG LLP declining
to accept such engagement, either Buyer or Seller may thereafter request that
the American Arbitration Association make such selection (as applicable, KPMG
LLP, the firm selected by Buyer and Seller or the firm selected by the American
Arbitration Association is referred to as the "CPA FIRM"). Buyer and Seller
shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render its
determination within 30 days after the issue is first submitted to the CPA Firm.
The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and
Seller. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by
Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall make readily available to the CPA Firm
all relevant books and records relating to the Closing Statement and all other
items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The Closing Statement as agreed to
by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the CPA Firm shall be referred to as the
"FINAL CLOSING STATEMENT".

                  (c) In the event that Working Capital on the Final Closing
Statement exceeds Working Capital on the Base Statement, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller in cash the amount of such excess. In the event that Working Capital on
the Base Statement exceeds Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the amount of such excess. All amounts payable
under this Section 1.3(c) shall be paid within three business days of the
determination of the Final Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account in the United States of America designated in
writing by the recipient not less than one business day before such payment.

                  (d) The Seller and Buyer hereby agree that, on or before the
Closing Date, all intercompany accounts between the Company and the Seller and
the Seller's Affiliates shall be paid in full or offset, dividended or
distributed to the Seller or its Affiliates or otherwise cancelled without
payment. On or before the Closing Date, Seller also shall take, or shall cause
the Company to take, all actions necessary to exclude as an asset of the Company
the Company's investment in the 1Line System.

                                   ARTICLE II
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

                  Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

                  SECTION 2.1.      CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.

                  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. The LLC is a limited liability
company, duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Delaware. Seller is duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Delaware. Each of the Company and the LLC has all requisite power and
authority and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals to own its respective properties and assets and to conduct its
business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals would not have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.17). Each of the Company and the LLC is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 2.1
sets forth all of the jurisdictions in which the Company and the LLC are
qualified to do business.

                  SECTION 2.2.      CAPITALIZATION; TITLE.

                  All of the outstanding Shares of the Company and all of the
outstanding Membership Units of the LLC are owned of record and beneficially by
Seller. All of the Shares and Membership Units have been validly issued, and the
Shares are fully paid and nonassessable. Except for this Agreement, there are no
outstanding options, warrants, agreements, conversion rights, preemptive rights
or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire the Shares or
Membership Units. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which Seller, the Company or the LLC is a party with respect
to the voting of the Shares or the Membership Units. There is no indebtedness of
the Company or the LLC having general voting rights issued and outstanding.
Except for this Agreement, there are no outstanding obligations of any person to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire outstanding Shares or Membership Units
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any Shares or Membership
Units. Seller has valid and marketable title to the Shares and Membership Units
free and clear of any Encumbrances. True and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Company and the LLC with all amendments thereto
to the date hereof, have been made available by the Seller to the Buyer or its
representatives. "ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS" shall mean certificates of
incorporation, by-laws, certificates of formation, limited liability company
operating agreements,

                                       4

<PAGE>

partnership or limited partnership agreements or other formation or governing
documents of a particular entity.

                  SECTION 2.3.      SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY INTERESTS.

                  Neither the Company nor the LLC has any subsidiaries, and they
do not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock, voting rights
or other equity interests or investments in any other Person. Neither the
Company nor the LLC has any rights to acquire by any means, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, voting rights, equity interests or investments in
another Person.

                  SECTION 2.4.      VALIDITY OF AGREEMENT; AUTHORIZATION.

                  Seller has the power to enter into this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which Seller is a party and to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the performance of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of
The Williams Companies, Inc. and the Management Committee of Seller, and no
other proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize such
execution, delivery and performance. This Agreement and the Transaction
Documents each have been or will be duly executed by Seller and constitutes or
will constitute Seller's valid and binding obligation enforceable against Seller
in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that its enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar
law affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general
equitable principles).

                  SECTION 2.5.      NO CONFLICT OR VIOLATION.

                  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.5, the execution, delivery

                  Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.6, no material consent,

2000, and the notes thereto, and the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as

The Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of such dates
and for the periods then ended (the partial year Financial Statements being
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments consistent with prior periods).

                  SECTION 2.8.      ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.

Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except

                  SECTION 2.16.     CONTRACTS.

(subject to the dollar amount limitations of clauses (a) or (b) below) a true
and complete list of the following contracts, agreements, instruments and
commitments to which the Company or the LLC is a party or otherwise relating to

the Company or the LLC of amounts greater than $250,000 in any year;

agreements, mortgages, security agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements, trust

and

                  (c) partnership or joint venture or noncompete agreements
("MATERIAL CONTRACTS").

                  Each Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable
against the Company or the LLC, as the case may be, and, to the Seller's
Knowledge, each of the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, and
in full force and effect on the date hereof except where a failure to be so
valid, binding or enforceable or in full force and effect would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  The Company or the LLC, as the case may be, and, to Seller's
Knowledge, the other party(ies) to any Material Contract, have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under, and
are not in material default or breach of in respect of, any Material Contract,
and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would

                  SECTION 2.18.     EMPLOYEE PLANS.

                  (a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.18(a)(i), neither
Seller, the Company, the LLC, nor any of their Affiliates sponsors or maintains,
and has not at any time during the past five years sponsored or maintained, any
"EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN," as defined under Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or any other
bonus, pension, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, equity
incentive, welfare, profit-sharing, retirement, disability, vacation, severance,
hospitalization, insurance, incentive, deferred compensation, compensation,
fringe benefit or other employee benefit plan, fund, trust, program, agreement
or arrangement, whether written or oral, in each of the foregoing cases which
cover, are maintained for the benefit of, or relate to any or all current or
former employees, directors or independent contractors of the Company or the LLC
or Dedicated Employees ("EMPLOYEE PLANS"). Seller or the Company has delivered
to Buyer complete and correct copies of each Employee Plan, or written summaries
of any unwritten Employee Plan. Schedule 2.18(a)(ii) sets forth a true and
complete list of all Employee Plans which are sponsored solely by the Company
and which cover only current or former employees, directors or independent
contractors of the Company or the LLC (the "COMPANY PLANS").

                  (b) Schedule 2.18(b)(i) sets forth a list showing the names of
employees of the Company and employees of Seller who are assigned to the
business of the Company, ("BUSINESS EMPLOYEES"). Except as set forth on Schedule
2.18(b)(ii), there are no contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements covering
any Business Employee with "CHANGE OF CONTROL" or similar provisions that would
be triggered as a result of the consummation of this Agreement. To Seller's
Knowledge, none of the Business Employees is obligated under any contract
(including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or other agreement,
or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative
agency, that would interfere with the use of such employee's efforts to promote
the interests of the Company or Buyer or that would conflict with the Company's
business as presently conducted. Neither Seller nor the Company has received
notice from any officer or key Business Employee or group of Business Employees,
that such person(s) intends to terminate their employment.

                  (c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect, each Employee Plan sponsored or maintained by
the Company has been maintained and operated in compliance with its terms, the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the requirements of
applicable law, including the Code and ERISA, and each Employee Plan intended to
be "QUALIFIED" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS and nothing has occurred since the
date of such favorable determination letter which would adversely affect the
qualified status of such plan.

                  (d) All contributions and premium payments required to have
been paid under or with respect to any Employee Plan have been timely paid.

                  (e) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.18(e), no Employee Plan
provides health, life insurance or other welfare benefits to retirees or other
terminated employees of the Company or Dedicated Employees, other than
continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601-608
of ERISA ("COBRA").

                  (f) No Employee Plan is a multi-employer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a) of ERISA, and neither the Company nor the
LLC has any outstanding liability with respect to any such plan.

                  (g) With respect to any "DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN", within the
meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA, maintained or contributed to by Seller, the
Company, the LLC or any entity treated as a single employer with Seller, the
Company, or the LLC under Section 4001(a) of ERISA ("ERISA AFFILIATE"): (i) no
liability to the PBGC has been incurred (other than for premiums not yet due);
(ii) no notice of intent to terminate any such plan has been filed with the PBGC
or distributed to participants and no amendment terminating any such plan has
been adopted; (iii) no proceedings to terminate any such plan have been
instituted by the PBGC and no event or condition has occurred which might
constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any such plan; (iv) no "ACCUMULATED
FUNDING DEFICIENCY," within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, whether or not waived, has been incurred; (v) no "REPORTABLE EVENT"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived by the PBGC) has occurred within the last six
years; (vi) no lien has arisen under ERISA or the Code, or is likely to arise,
on the assets of the Company or the LLC; (vii) there has been no cessation of
operations at a facility subject to the provisions of Section 4062(e) of ERISA
within the last six years; and (viii) no event has occurred that places
participants on actual or constructive notice of the plan's termination.

                  (h) No event has occurred and no condition exists with respect
to any Employee Plan which could subject any Employee Plan, the Company, the
LLC, Buyer or any of their employees, agents, directors or Affiliates, directly
or indirectly (through an indemnification agreement or otherwise), to a
liability for a breach of fiduciary duty, a "PROHIBITED TRANSACTION," within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a tax, penalty
or fine under Section 502 or 4071 of ERISA or Subtitle D, Chapter 43 of the
Code.

                  (i) Except for litigation regarding Parent's 401(k) plan,
there are no actions, suits, or claims (other than routine claims for benefits
in the ordinary course) with respect to any Employee Plan pending which could
give rise to a material liability, or to Seller's Knowledge, threatened, and
Seller has no knowledge of any facts which could give rise to any such actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course).
No Employee Plan is currently under governmental investigation or audit and, to
Seller's Knowledge, no such investigation or audit is contemplated or under
consideration.

                  (j) Neither the Company nor the LLC has any liability,
contingent or otherwise, (i) with respect to any terminated employee benefit
plan or arrangement or (ii) under Section 4069 or 4212 of ERISA.

                  (k) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18(k), (i) no Business
Employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement; (ii) no Business
Employees are, or within the last three years have been, represented by a union
or other bargaining agent; and (iii) to Seller's Knowledge, no union organizing
efforts are pending with respect to Business Employees. Seller or the Company
has delivered to Buyer a complete and correct copy of any collective bargaining
agreement applicable to Business Employees. Within the last three years, there
has been no

                                       12

strike, work slowdown or other material labor dispute with respect to Business
Employees, nor to Seller's Knowledge, is there pending or threatened (i) any
strike, work slowdown or other material labor dispute involving Business
Employees, or (ii) any grievance or arbitration proceeding involving Business
Employees, whether arising out of any collective bargaining agreement or
otherwise.

                  SECTION 2.19.     INSURANCE.

                  (a) Schedule 2.19 sets forth a true and complete list of all
current policies of all material property and casualty insurance, insuring the
properties, assets, employees and/or operations of the Company and the LLC
(collectively, the "POLICIES"). All premiums payable under such Policies have
been paid in a timely manner and the Company and the LLC have complied fully
with the terms and conditions of all such Policies.

                  (b) All Policies are in full force and effect. Coverage for
the Company and the LLC under the Policies shall terminate on the Closing Date.
Neither the Company nor the LLC is in default under any provisions of the
Policies, and there is no claim by the Company or any other Person pending under
any of the Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
by the underwriters or issuers of such Policies. After the Closing Date, Seller
or Parent shall continue to manage all workers' compensation and general and
automobile liability claims of the Company and the LLC, which are known and
reported on or prior to the Closing Date, or which are covered under the
worker's compensation policy or the primary automobile or general liability
policy shown on Schedule 2.19. Buyer shall be responsible for all costs on
account of such claims, including but not limited to deductibles and third party
administrator charges.

                  whole, increase the benefits or compensation to any current or

                           (xiii)   other than routine compliance filings, make

                  except an agreement or an amendment, modification or
                  termination of a contract, lease or license entered into in
                  the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
                  that would not have been considered to have been a Material
                  Contract had it been entered into prior to the date of this
                  Agreement;

                           (xv)     cancel, compromise, waive, release or settle
                  any right, claim or lawsuit other than in the ordinary course
                  of business consistent with past practices; or

                           (xvi)    commit itself to do any of the foregoing.

                  (b) Seller agrees to cause the Company to consult with and to
take into account Buyer's reasonable requests before finalizing the expansion
and discretionary-maintenance capital expenditure plans and project schedules
included in the 2003 capital budget for the Company.

                  SECTION 4.2.      ACCESS TO PROPERTIES AND RECORDS.

                  (a) Seller shall afford, and shall cause the Company, the LLC
and Seller's other Affiliates to afford, to Buyer and Buyer's accountants,
counsel and representatives upon reasonable advance notice reasonable access
during normal business hours throughout the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending on the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VII hereof) to all the Company's and the LLC's properties,
books, contracts, and records and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to
Buyer all information concerning the Company's and the LLC's business,
properties, liabilities and personnel as Buyer may request, provided that no
investigation or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall
affect any representation or warranty of Seller or the conditions to the
obligations of Buyer. Additionally, Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer shall have no right of access to, and Seller
shall have no obligation to provide to Buyer, (1) bids received from others in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and information
and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids or (2) any
information the disclosure of which Seller has concluded may jeopardize any
privilege available to the Company, the LLC or Seller relating to such
information or would cause the Company, the LLC or Seller to breach a
confidentiality obligation. Buyer agrees that if Buyer or its authorized
representatives receive, or if the information (whether in electronic mail
format, on computer hard drives or otherwise) held

                                       19

<PAGE>

by the Company or the LLC as of the Closing includes information that relates to
the business operations or other strategic matters of the Seller, its corporate
parent or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company or the LLC) such
information shall be held in confidence on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, but the term of the
restriction on the disclosure and use of such information shall continue in
effect as to such information for a period of five years from the Closing. Buyer
further agrees that if Seller or Company or the LLC inadvertently furnishes to
Buyer copies of or access to information that is subject to clause (2) of the
second preceding sentence, Buyer will, upon Seller's request promptly return
same to Seller together with any and all extracts therefrom or notes pertaining
thereto (whether in electronic or other format). Buyer shall indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Losses asserted
against or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties relating to, resulting
from, or arising out of, examinations or inspections made by Buyer or its
authorized representatives pursuant to this Section 4.2(a).

                  (b) Each of the parties agrees that it shall preserve and
keep, and make available to the other party for reasonable business needs, all
books and records relating to the business or operations of the Company and the
LLC on or before the Closing Date in its possession (including with respect to
Seller, to the extent in its possession, the most recent rate case records and
files of the Company and all other records and files of the Company and Seller
necessary for the Company to make a future rate case filing with the FERC) for a
period of at least 6 years from the Closing Date, except to the extent
previously delivered to the other party and receipt of which acknowledged in
writing by the other party. After such 6-year period, before a party may dispose
of any of such books and records, at least 90 calendar days' prior notice to
such effect shall be given to the other party, and the other party shall be
given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any
part of such books and records that the notifying party elects to dispose of.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees that it shall preserve and keep
all books and records of the Company and the LLC in its possession relating to
any audit or investigation instituted by a Governmental Authority or any
litigation (whether or not existing on the Closing Date), in each case of which
it has actual knowledge, until any such audit, investigation or proceeding has
been completed or finally resolved, if it is reasonably obvious that such audit,
investigation or litigation may relate to matters occurring prior to the
Closing.

                  SECTION 4.3.      EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, representatives of Buyer and Seller shall meet to identify employees
of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or the LLC) who
are not Business Employees and to whom Buyer and Seller agree that Buyer, the
Company or any Affiliate of Buyer may make offers of employment (collectively,
the "ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES"). Buyer, the Company or any other Affiliate of Buyer
(i) shall offer employment effective as of the Closing Date to each Business
Employee, and (ii) may offer employment effective as of the Closing Date to each
Additional Employee, in each case on such terms and conditions as Buyer may
determine in its discretion, provided, however, that such terms and conditions
shall be reasonable in relation to the terms and conditions upon which similarly
situated employees of Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates are employed.
Business Employees and Additional Employees who accept such offer of employment
effective as of the Closing Date shall be referred to as "TRANSFERRED
EMPLOYEES." The total number of Business Employees and Additional Employees that
Seller will make

                                       20

<PAGE>

available to Buyer for employment will be no less than 492, and Buyer, the
Company or any other Affiliate of Buyer will make offers to no fewer than 458 of
such Persons. Buyer shall not initiate any contact with any of Seller, Company
or LLC employees except for Business or Additional Employees. After the date
hereof and prior to Closing, Seller shall afford, and shall cause the Company
and the LLC and Seller's other Affiliates to afford, to Buyer or its Affiliates
reasonable access to the Additional Employees for the purpose of enabling Buyer
and its Affiliates to determine to which of such employees it desires to extend
offers of employment.

                  (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall take, or
shall cause the Company and the LLC to take, all necessary action to effect the
cessation of, and withdrawal from, participation by the Company and the LLC in
any Employee Plan which is not a Company Plan ("SELLER PLAN") and Transferred
Employees shall cease active participation in any Seller Plan as of such date.

                  (c) Each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of
benefits, be given credit for all service with Seller prior to the Closing Date,
using the same methodology used by Seller as of the date hereof for crediting
service and determining levels of benefits (i) under all employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Buyer, the
Company or another Affiliate of Buyer in which the Transferred Employees become
participants for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determination of level of benefits (excluding, however, benefit accrual or
subsidies under any defined benefit plans), and (ii) for purposes of calculating
the amount of each Transferred Employee's severance benefits, if any.

                  (d) With respect to the plan year during which the Closing
Date occurs, Buyer will, or will cause its appropriate Affiliate to, (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred
Employees under any medical, dental and life insurance benefit plans that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
welfare plan maintained for the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that
such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date. Buyer will
also ensure that Transferred Employees and their dependents who have commenced
orthodontia treatment prior to the Closing Date receive at least the same level
of benefit coverage for such treatment as they would have received if they had
remained employed by Seller.

                  (e) Transferred Employees who are otherwise eligible for early
retirement under the Williams Pension Plan as of the Closing Date shall be
permitted to retire and commence receipt of benefits notwithstanding their
continued employment with the Company, the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.

                  (f) On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause the assets of the Union Pension Plan held under a Seller
master trust to be transferred to a trust established or maintained by Buyer,
the Company or any other Affiliate of Buyer. Such transfer

                                       21

<PAGE>

shall be made within one business day after any valuation date of Seller's
master trust and shall be made in cash, marketable securities or other property
acceptable to Buyer.

                  (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees
shall become fully vested in their account balances in any defined contribution
or 401(k) Plan maintained by Seller on behalf of such Transferred Employees (the
"SELLER SAVINGS PLAN") and distributions of such account balances shall be made
available to such Transferred Employees as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, in accordance with, the provisions of Seller Savings Plan and
applicable law. Thereafter, Buyer shall accept, or shall cause the Company or
the appropriate Affiliate of Buyer to accept, rollover contributions from Seller
Savings Plan into a defined contribution or 401(k) Plan maintained by Buyer, the
Company or another Affiliate of Buyer (the "BUYER SAVINGS PLAN") of the account
balances distributed to the Transferred Employees from Seller Savings Plan in
accordance with the provisions of the Buyer Savings Plan and applicable law.
Such rollovers shall be made in cash and other property acceptable to Buyer.

                  (h) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, or
shall cause the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer to assume, Seller's
obligation for providing retiree medical benefits to employees who are
represented by Local No. 647, International Union of Operating Engineers,
AFL-CIO ("UNION EMPLOYEES") or former Union Employees. On or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred from
Seller's VEBA trust to a VEBA trust established or maintained by Buyer, the
Company or another Affiliate of Buyer assets attributable to current and former
Union Employees. Such transfer shall be made in cash, marketable securities or
other property acceptable to Buyer.

                  (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, or
shall cause the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer to assume, Seller's
liabilities and obligations for providing retiree medical benefits to
Transferred Employees who are not Union Employees ("SALARIED EMPLOYEES") and who
as of the Closing Date are not eligible to retire under Seller's retiree medical
benefit plan. Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations for retiree
medical benefits for Salaried Employees who as of the Closing Date are eligible
to retire under Seller's retiree medical benefits plan and for retired or former
Business Employees.

                  (j) Seller shall be responsible for any continuation of group
health coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601 through
608 of ERISA with respect to any Business Employee or any "QUALIFIED
BENEFICIARY" (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) of any such employee who
incurs a "QUALIFYING EVENT" (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) on or
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer, the Company or the appropriate Affiliate of
Buyer shall be responsible for any continuation of group health coverage
required under Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA
with respect to any Transferred Employee or any "QUALIFIED BENEFICIARY" (as
defined in Section 4980B of the Code) who incurs a "QUALIFYING EVENT" (as
defined in Section 4980B of the Code) after the Closing Date.

                  (k) Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate as necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.3 and to ensure an orderly
transition of benefits coverage with respect to the Transferred Employees from
the Seller Plans to the appropriate plans established by Buyer, the Company or
another Affiliate of Buyer, including, without limitation, coverage with respect
to Seller's educational assistance plan and Seller's Code Section 125 plan.

                                       22

<PAGE>

                  (l) Each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of
benefits, be given credit for all accrued but unused paid-time-off under
Seller's paid-time-off program as of the Closing Date, using the same
methodology used by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date for crediting
service and determining the amount of such paid time-off benefits.

                  (m) If Buyer, the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer
terminates the employment of a Transferred Employee who is a Salaried Employee
at any time between the Closing Date and the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Company or such other Affiliate of
Buyer, as appropriate, to provide, such Transferred Employee with a severance
benefit equal to the greater of (i) the benefit provided under the applicable
plan or program of Buyer, the Company or another Affiliate of Buyer and (ii) a
sum equal to two weeks of pay for every year of service with a minimum of six
weeks and a maximum of fifty-two weeks total severance benefit. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall such an employee be entitled to severance if
such employee is terminated for cause, as defined under the terms of Seller's
severance plan or program as in effect on the date hereof ("SELLER'S SEVERANCE
PLAN"), a copy of which has been provided to Buyer, or if such employee would
not otherwise be entitled to severance under the terms of Seller's Severance
Plan, including, without limitation, by reason of the employee's failure to
provide a release to the Company.

                  (n) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section
4.3, Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations under Seller's Plans.

                  (o) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit Buyer's right to
terminate the employment of any employee at any time or, except as provided in
paragraph (m) above, amend or terminate any employee benefit plan or
arrangement.

                  SECTION 4.4.      CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

                  (a) Seller and Buyer shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or in the case of Seller, cause the Company and
the LLC to obtain, all necessary consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals
of all Governmental Authorities, and of all other persons required in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance by them of this Agreement and will
cooperate fully with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals, giving such notices, and making
such filings. To the extent required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR ACT"), each Party shall (i) file or cause to
be filed, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than the tenth
business day after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the
Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, all
reports and other documents required to be filed by such Party under the HSR Act
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly comply with or
cause to be complied with any requests by the Federal Trade Commission or the
United States Department of Justice for additional information concerning such
transactions, in each case so that the waiting period applicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall
expire as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. Each Party agrees to request, and to cooperate with the other Party
in requesting, early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act.

                                       23

<PAGE>

                  (b) Without limiting the generality of Buyer's undertakings
pursuant to Section 4.6, Buyer shall take promptly any or all of the following
actions to the extent necessary to eliminate any concerns on the part of the
Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice regarding
the legality under any antitrust laws of Buyer's acquisition of the Shares and
Membership Units: entering into negotiations, providing information, making
proposals, entering into and performing agreements or submitting to judicial or
administrative orders, holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) particular assets or categories of assets, or businesses of the
Company or the LLC, or agreeing to dispose of one or more assets or properties
(whether owned by Buyer or its Affiliates or the Company or LLC) following the
Closing; use commercially reasonable efforts (including taking the steps
contemplated by Section 4.4(a)(i)) to prevent the entry in a judicial or
administrative proceeding brought under any antitrust law by the Federal Trade
Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other party for a
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order that would make consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful or that would
prevent or delay such consummation; and take promptly, in the event that such an
injunction or order has been issued in such a proceeding, any and all reasonable
steps, including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the steps
contemplated by Section 4.4(a)(i), necessary to vacate, modify, or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) If the transfer of any instrument, contract, license,
lease, permit, or other document to Buyer hereunder shall require the consent of
any party thereto other than Seller, then this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same, and such item shall not be assigned to or assumed
by Buyer, if an actual or attempted assignment thereof would constitute a breach
thereof or default thereunder. In such case, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
and each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents to
the extent required of such other parties and, if and when any such consents are
obtained, to transfer the applicable instrument, contract, license, lease,
permit, or other document. If any such consent cannot be obtained, Seller shall
cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to obtain for Buyer all
benefits, privileges, obligations and privileges of the applicable instrument,
contract, license, lease, permit, or document, including, without limitation,
possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain and dominion, control and
demand. Without the express written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not commence
proceedings to bring in any partner or operator or take any other action prior
to Closing, the effect of which would add any additional regulatory or other
approvals by any Governmental Authority or delay the Closing in any way.

                  SECTION 4.5.      FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  Upon the request of Buyer at any time after the Closing Date,
Seller will promptly execute and deliver such further instruments of assignment,
transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization and other
documents as the requesting party or parties or its or their counsel may
reasonably request in order to perfect title of Buyer and its successors and
assigns to the Shares and the Membership Units or otherwise to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.6.      REASONABLE EFFORTS.

                  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable law
to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  SECTION 4.7.      NOTICE OF BREACH.

                  Buyer shall promptly give to Seller written notice with
particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that would constitute a breach
of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Seller's representations in Article
II. Seller shall have the right prior to the Closing to supplement the
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter which would have been required to
be set forth on or described in such Disclosure Schedule (a "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
UPDATE"). Any such supplemental disclosure will not be deemed to have been
disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of determining whether
the conditions set forth in Article V have been satisfied, but, if the Closing
occurs, such update shall be deemed to have cured any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the matters set forth in such update
for purposes of indemnification pursuant to Article VIII.

                  SECTION 4.8.      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                  For two years after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any person any information not in
the public domain or generally known in the industry, in any form, whether
acquired prior to or after the Closing Date, relating to the business and
operations of the Company or the LLC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may
disclose any information relating to the business and operations of the Company
or the LLC (i) if required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, (ii) to
other Persons in the conduct of Seller's or its Affiliates' other businesses,
provided such disclosure is made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices or if not in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices, such other Persons enter into a confidentiality agreement with
Seller similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii) to such other
Persons if, at the time such information is provided, such Person is already in
the possession of such information.

                  SECTION 4.9.      NEGOTIATIONS.

                  From and after the date hereof, neither Seller, the Company,
the LLC nor their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, stockholders,
representatives, agents, nor anyone acting on behalf of them shall, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person (other than Buyer or its representatives)
concerning any merger, sale of assets, purchase or sale of Shares or the
Membership Units or similar transaction involving the Company or the LLC unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article VII
hereof.

                  SECTION 4.10.     TAX COVENANTS.

                  (a) Seller shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns
relating to the Company or the LLC with the appropriate federal, state, local
and foreign governmental agencies, and pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon,
for which Tax Returns are due and Taxes are payable prior to the Closing Date.
For periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, but for which Tax Returns
are not due and Taxes are not payable as of the Closing Date, Seller shall, no
later than 15 days before the applicable due date, prepare and submit to Buyer
for review, signature, and filing all such Tax Returns required to be filed by
the Company or the LLC, and Seller shall timely pay the Taxes shown to be due
thereon. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller specifically agrees to indemnify
and hold Buyer harmless from and against any liability of the Company or the LLC
for or in respect of any Taxes under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any analogous or similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise, for any full or partial Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and file all
Tax Returns for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date and shall pay all
Taxes shown to be due thereon; provided, that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
its allocable share of any Taxes attributable to Tax periods including the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date ("STRADDLE PERIOD"). Buyer and
Seller shall utilize appropriate methods to allocate liability for purposes of
the preceding sentence, which appropriate methods shall include the following,
without limitation: (i) for any transactional Taxes, including, without
limitation, Taxes based on sales, revenue, or gross or net income, the
allocation of liability between Seller and Buyer shall be determined using a
closing-of-the-books method assuming that the applicable Tax period consists of
two taxable periods, one ending at the close of the Closing Date and one
beginning at the opening of the day after the Closing Date, and (ii) for any
real estate Taxes or other property or asset-based Taxes, the allocation of
liability between Seller and Buyer shall be based on the number of days the
applicable asset was held by the Company or the LLC in the applicable Tax period
prior to and including the Closing Date as compared to the number of days the
applicable asset was held by the Company or the LLC in the applicable Tax period
after the Closing Date.

                  (b) Seller will cause any tax sharing agreement or similar
arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company or the LLC to be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent any such agreement or
arrangement relates to the Company or the LLC, and after the Closing Date the
Company and the LLC shall have no obligation under any such agreement or
arrangement for any past, present or future period.

                  (c) All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property
transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar
taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto
and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSFER TAXES"),
shall be borne by the party on which such Transfer Taxes are imposed by
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.10,
any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will
use reasonable commercial efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party
at least 10 days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. If such a Tax
Return is not timely filed, any interest and penalties incurred as a result
shall be the responsibility of the

                                       26

<PAGE>

filing party. In the event that any dispute between the parties concerning the
form or content of such Tax Returns cannot be timely resolved prior to their due
date through good-faith negotiation, the determination of the party liable for
the applicable Transfer Taxes shall be controlling.

                  (d) If the Buyer elects and is qualified to do so, Buyer and
Seller shall make an election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
comparable election under state, local or foreign tax law) ("SECTION 338(h)(10)
ELECTION") with respect to the acquisition of the Company by Buyer. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate fully with each other in the making of such election. In
particular, Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all tax
returns and forms (the "SECTION 338 FORMS") required under applicable tax law to
be filed in connection with making the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall
deliver to Buyer no later than 45 days prior to the date the Section 338 Forms
are required to be filed, such documents and other forms as reasonably requested
by Buyer to properly complete the Section 338 Forms. Buyer and Seller shall
allocate the Purchase Price in the manner required by Section 338 and Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, as
applicable. Such allocations shall be used for purposes of determining the
aggregate deemed sales price under the applicable Treasury Regulations and in
reporting the deemed sale of assets of the Company in connection with the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Buyer shall initially prepare a completed set of
IRS Forms 8023 (and any comparable forms required to be filed under state, local
or foreign tax law) and any additional data or materials required to be attached
to Form 8023 pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338
of the Code. Buyer shall deliver said forms to Seller for review no later than
45 days prior to the date the Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. In the
event Seller objects to the manner in which the Section 338 Forms have been
prepared, Seller shall notify Buyer within 15 days of receipt of the Section 338
Forms of such objection, and the parties shall endeavor within the next 15 days
in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such
dispute within said 15 day period, Buyer and Seller shall submit such dispute to
an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the "ALLOCATION
ARBITER") selected by Buyer and Seller, which firm shall not be the auditor of
the financial statements of either Buyer or Seller. Promptly, but not later than
15 days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the Allocation Arbiter
will determine (based solely on presentations of Buyer and Seller and not by
independent review) only those matters in dispute and will render a written
report as to the disputed matters and the resulting preparation of the Section
338 Forms shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Seller shall be
responsible for all federal income Taxes attributable to Company resulting from
the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall be liable for any state, local or
foreign Tax attributable to an election under the state, local or foreign law
similar to the election available under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code. Buyer
shall be responsible for and shall pay any income, franchise or similar taxes
imposed by any state or local taxing authority as a result of any Section 338(g)
election (or any comparable election under state law) if such state or local
taxing authority does not allow or respect a Section 338(h)(10) Election (or any
comparable or resulting election under state law) with respect to the purchase
and sale of the shares of Company contemplated hereby.

                  (e) Seller and Buyer shall each provide the other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them in connection with
the preparation of any Tax return, any audit or other examination by any Tax
authority or any judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to Taxes,
and each retain in accordance with its customary document retention

                                       27

<PAGE>

policies and provide the other with any records or other information which may
be relevant to any such return, audit, examination or proceeding.

                  (f) Buyer shall, in the event that Buyer or, following the
Closing Date, the Company or the LLC receives notice (whether orally or in
writing) of any audit, examination or claim by any taxing authority with respect
to Taxes for which Buyer or its Affiliates may be indemnified (a "TAX CLAIM"),
promptly notify the Seller thereof, provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent that Seller has been actually prejudiced by such failure. Except in
the case of Taxes imposed with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller shall have
the right to contest, at its own expense, any Tax Claim, and shall be entitled
to control any such contest, provided, however, that Seller shall not be
entitled to settle or compromise any such contest without the consent of Buyer
if such settlement or compromise could affect the tax liability of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for any period after the Closing. In the case of the contest
of a Tax Claim with respect to any Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right
to participate at its own expense in any such contest to the extent that the
outcome could affect the liability of the Seller hereunder, and Buyer shall not
settle any such contest in a manner that could affect the liability of the
Seller without Seller's consent.

                  SECTION 4.11.     INSURANCE, BONDS AND COLLATERAL.

                  (a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate so that all
surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash collateral issued in respect of the
Company or the LLC listed on Schedule 4.11 (collectively, the "SELLER'S BONDS")
are released and replaced immediately after the Closing and Buyer shall take
such actions as are necessary to replace and release all the Seller's Bonds not
later than 30 days after the Closing Date by comparable surety bonds, letters of
credit and cash collateral provided by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (the
"BUYER'S BONDS"). Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the Bonds until they are released and replaced by Buyer. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for any and all
Losses (in each case without deduction or set off) incurred on account of the
Seller's Bonds on or after the Closing Date insofar as such Losses relate to
events occurring after Closing.

                  (b) Seller agrees to pursue recovery under the applicable
excess-liability insurance policies relating to claims made in connection with
the explosion that is the subject of the Legal Proceeding described in Item III
of Schedule 2.15 (KCP&L v. Bibb and Associates, et al.). Seller shall pay Buyer
an amount equal to the amount of any recovery for monetary damages with respect
to the claims for which Seller receives reimbursement from its excess liability
carriers less any unreimbursed amounts incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in
pursuing its recovery.

                  SECTION 4.12.     INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

                  (a)      The parties shall each designate representatives to a
migration team ("IT MIGRATION TEAM") that shall be responsible for identifying
the specific software and hardware, and agreements for the maintenance, support
or service thereof, necessary for Buyer to continue operations of Company and
the LLC in the manner in which they operate as of the Closing Date,

                                       28

<PAGE>

including any software listed on Schedule 2.12 ("IT ASSETS"). The IT Migration
Team shall also be responsible for developing a detailed plan to include cost
estimates and timetables for: conversion and loading of existing Company and LLC
data, integration of the IT Assets into Buyer's or its Affiliate's information
technology systems and transfer or replacement of IT Asset licenses and
maintenance agreements not currently held in Company's or the LLC's name and any
post-closing transitional services required by Buyer, the Company or the LLC
("IT MIGRATION PLAN"). The Migration Team shall complete the preparation of the
IT Migration Plan no later than 45 days after execution of this Agreement. The
IT Migration Team then promptly shall begin the pre-Closing implementation of
the IT Migration Plan in order for the parties to be in a position to complete
the post-Closing transfer, conversion and loading of the Company and LLC data
from Seller to Buyer or Buyer's designated Affiliates, all in accordance with
the IT Migration Plan. The time for completion and execution of the IT Migration
Plan shall be referred to as the "IT MIGRATION PERIOD." The respective rights,
benefits and obligations of the parties, their Affiliates and the Company and
the LLC addressed in the IT Migration Plan, including the provision of various
services and products by Seller and its Affiliates to Buyer, the Company and the
LLC for the respective post-Closing transition period specified for such
services or products in the IT Migration Plan, will be set forth in an agreement
to be substantially in the form of the Transition Services Agreement attached as
Exhibit 4.12 to be executed and delivered by Seller, Parent and Buyer prior to
Closing (the "TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT").

                  (b)      On or before the expiration of the IT Migration
Period and in accordance with the IT Migration Plan, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to either: (i) assign to Buyer, Company or the LLC all of
their respective right, title and interest in the IT Assets, including license
and contract rights, and secure any consents necessary for such assignment; (ii)
with respect to license and software rights that, in accordance with the IT
Migration Plan, are to be retained by Seller and its Affiliates during the IT
Migration Period, secure any consents necessary for the use by the Seller and
its Affiliates of the IT Assets on behalf of the Company or Buyer during the IT
Migration Period; or (iii) obtain for the Buyer or its designated Affiliate, on
commercially reasonable terms and at Buyer's expense, comparable replacements
for any IT Assets not assigned pursuant to (i) above. Fees for license transfers
or comparable replacements shall be borne by Buyer. Costs related to Seller's
employees and contractors involved in the preparation and implementation of the
IT Migration Plan shall be borne by Seller, and costs related to Buyer's
employees and contractors involved in the preparation and implementation of the
IT Migration Plan shall be borne by Buyer.

                  SECTION 4.13.     SOFTWARE LICENSE.

                  Effective upon the Closing Date, Seller, for itself and on

                           (iii)    any Losses arising with respect to the
                  Company or the LLC whether occurring before or after Closing
                  to the extent such Losses (x) cannot be properly asserted
                  against Seller under Section 8.2(a) or otherwise by Buyer,
                  except to the extent such Losses cannot be properly asserted
                  against Seller because of limitations under Section 8.2(c),

                  (c) The foregoing indemnification obligations shall be subject

                  and until the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses
                  exceeds $5,000,000 (the "DEDUCTIBLE"), at which point Seller
                  shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
                  only as to the amount of such Losses in excess of the
                  Deductible, subject to the limitation in Section 8.2(c)(i),
                  provided however, that the Deductible shall not be applicable

                  indemnification, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY," and the other party,
                  the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") shall be reduced by any third-party
                  insurance or other indemnification benefits which such party
                  receives in respect of or as a result of such Losses. If any

                  subsequently reduced by any third-party insurance or other
                  indemnification benefit or recovery, the amount of the
                  reduction, shall be remitted to the Indemnifying Party;

                           (iv)     any calculation of Losses for purposes of
                  Article VIII hereof shall be net of any U.S. federal, state or
                  local tax benefit to Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer
                  Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this
                  Article VIII hereof, as the case may be (such party seeking
                  indemnification, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY", and the other party,
                  the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY");

                           (v)      no claim may be asserted nor may any action
                  be commenced against Seller for breach or inaccuracy of any
                  representation or breach of a warranty, unless written notice
                  of such claim or action is received by Seller describing in
                  reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
                  the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the
                  date on which the representation or warranty on which such
                  claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in
                  Section 8.1;

                           (vi)     an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled
                  under this Agreement to multiple recovery for the same Losses;
                  and

                           (vii)    the limitations on indemnification set forth
                  in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.2(c) shall not apply to
                  any Losses arising from any inaccuracy or breach of Section
                  2.2, the failure by Seller or Buyer to pay any Taxes in
                  accordance with Section 4.10 or for any amounts payable in
                  accordance with Section 9.3 hereof.

                  SECTION 8.3.      PROCEDURES.

                  Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
(with reasonable specificity) promptly after it becomes aware of facts
supporting a claim or action for indemnification under this Article VIII, and
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all
information and documentation necessary to support and verify any Losses
associated with such claim or action. Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iv), the failure
to so notify or provide information to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the
extent of such material prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within ten days after
receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion
of any claim or action, suit or proceeding by a third party in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, to participate in and defend, contest or
otherwise protect the Indemnified Party against any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding with counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice (which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the

                                       38

<PAGE>

Indemnified Party) at its sole cost and expense; provided, however, that (i) the
Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in such notice that, as between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, solely the Indemnifying Party
shall be obligated to satisfy and discharge such claim; (ii) such claim does not
include a request or demand for injunctive or other equitable relief by a
Governmental Authority and (iii) the Indemnifying Party makes reasonably
adequate provision to assure the Indemnified Party of the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to satisfy the full amount of any adverse monetary judgment
that is reasonably likely to result and continues to make such assurances; and,
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or
compromise without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the
Indemnified Party's choice and shall in any event shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit,
action, investigation, claim or proceeding in accordance herewith, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation,
the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying
Party, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements
and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding.

                  SECTION 8.4.      WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL, ETC. DAMAGES.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Buyer shall not be liable to any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, nor shall
Seller be liable to any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, for any exemplary,
punitive, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE, or speculative damages
(including, without limitation, any damages on account of lost profits or
OPPORTUNITIES) or resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  SECTION 8.5.      COMPLIANCE WITH EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE.

                  All releases, disclaimers, limitations on liability, and
indemnities in this Agreement, including those in this Article VIII, shall apply
even in the event of the sole, joint, and/or concurrent negligence, strict
liability, or other fault of the party whose liability is released, disclaimed,
limited, or indemnified.

                  SECTION 8.6.      LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

                  If Seller terminates this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1
(b) or 7.1(f), then Buyer shall pay to Seller a sum equal to Fifty-Five Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($55,500,000.00) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account in the United States of America designated in
writing by Seller not later than three days following receipt of such
designation. BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (1) THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER
CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN (2) THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
PROVIDED FOR IN

                                       39

<PAGE>

THIS SECTION 8.6 IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES AND (III) RECEIPT OF SUCH AMOUNT BY SELLER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A
PENALTY AND WILL BE SELLER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY SUCH TERMINATION
OF THIS AGREEMENT.

                  SECTION 8.7.      REMEDY.

                  Except for seeking equitable relief, from and after the
Closing the sole remedy of a party in connection with (i) a breach or inaccuracy
of the representations, or breach of warranties, in this Agreement or any
certificates or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement on Closing,
or (ii) any failure by a party to perform or observe any term, provision,
covenant, or agreement on the part of such party to be performed or observed
under this Agreement, shall, in each case, be as set forth in this Article VIII.

                  SECTION 8.8.      TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS.

                  Each party, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agrees
to treat any payments made pursuant to this Article VIII as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for all federal and state income and franchise Tax purposes.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 9.1.      PUBLICITY.

                  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each party
shall have the right to issue a press release to announce this transaction.
Thereafter, on or prior to the Closing Date, neither party shall, nor shall it
permit its Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such press release or
announcement is required by law or stock exchange rule to be made by the party
proposing to issue the same, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult in good faith with the other party prior to the issuance of any such
press release or announcement.

                  SECTION 9.2.      SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; NO THIRD-PARTY
BENEFICIARIES.

                  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Neither party shall assign or delegate any of the obligations created under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party; provided that,
without the consent of Seller, Buyer may assign all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates; and provided further,
that, without the consent of Seller, Buyer may collaterally assign its rights
and benefits under this Agreement to any lenders providing financing to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement to secure loans to be
made by such lenders to Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Except as contemplated
by Article VIII, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Person not a
party (or an Affiliate of a party) to this Agreement, or the legal
representatives of such Person, any rights or remedies of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

deemed an original and all of which together shall be considered one and the
same agreement.
