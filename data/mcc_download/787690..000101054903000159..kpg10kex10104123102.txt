         1.3.4    The lessee agrees to be  responsible  for all expenses such as
                  electricity,   telephone,   water  supply  charges  and  other

                  provisions, on behalf of the lessor.

                  In addition, for the monthly taxes of building and the land to

                  lessor within 30 days from the date of receiving a notice from
                  the lessor.

                  signatures of the Director of the lessor's  Finance  Division,
                  Finance  Department or a designated  person,  jointly with the
                  cashier  of the  Finance  Division,  Finance  Department  or a

         1.3.7    If the lessee is in  default  of payment of the rents,  duties
                  and other expenses payable to the lessor under this Agreement,

                  of 1.5 percent  (one point five) per month on the  outstanding
                  amount for the whole period of default.  A fraction of a month
                  shall be counted as one month.
