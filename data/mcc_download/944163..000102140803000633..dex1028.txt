                     TECHNOLOGY COLLATERAL ESCROW AGREEMENT

                                 Account Number

This agreement ("Agreement") is effective January 24, 2003 among DSI Technology
Escrow Services, Inc. ("DSI"), AirNet Communications Corporation ("Depositor")
and TECORE, Inc. ("TECORE") and SCP Private Equity Partners, II, LP ("SCP II")
(TECORE and SCP II are referred to collectively as the "Beneficiaries" and
individually as a "Beneficiary"), all of whom may collectively may be referred
to in this Agreement as the "Parties".

A. One or about the date hereof, Depositor and Beneficiaries have entered or
will enter into a Bridge Loan Agreement, Bridge Promissory Note, Security
Agreement and/or other agreement(s) (collectively referred to in this Agreement
as "the Collateral Agreement") regarding certain proprietary technology of
Depositor.

B. Depositor desires to avoid disclosure of its proprietary technology except
under certain limited circumstances.

C. The availability of the collateral, the proprietary technology of Depositor,
is critical to Beneficiaries in the conduct of their respective businesses and
in the performance of the Collateral Agreement. Therefore, Beneficiaries need
access to the proprietary technology under certain limited circumstances.

D. Depositor and Beneficiaries desire to establish an escrow with DSI to provide
for the retention, administration and controlled access of the proprietary
technology materials of Depositor.

E. The parties desire this Agreement to be supplementary to the Collateral
Agreement pursuant to 11 United States [Bankruptcy] Code, Section 365(n).

ARTICLE 1  --  DEPOSITS

1.1 Obligation to Make Deposit. Depositor shall deliver to DSI the proprietary
technology and other materials identified on Exhibit A (collectively, "Deposit
Materials"), which is to be prepared and signed by Depositor and each
Beneficiary, as follows: (a) Depositor shall deliver each of the items described
in Section 1(a) of Exhibit A no later than five (5) business days after the date
of this Agreement; and (b) Depositor shall deliver each of the items described
in Sections 1(b) through Section 1(f) of Exhibit A no later than fourteen (14)
days after the date of this Agreement. DSI shall have no obligation with respect
to the preparation, signing or delivery of Exhibit A.

1.2 Identification of Tangible Media. Prior to the delivery of the Deposit
Materials to DSI, Depositor shall conspicuously label for identification each
document, magnetic tape, disk, or other tangible media upon which the Deposit
Materials are written or stored. Additionally, Depositor shall complete one copy
of Exhibit B to this Agreement per deposit by listing each such tangible media
by the item label description, the type of media and the quantity. Each copy of
Exhibit B must be signed by Depositor and delivered to DSI with the Deposit
Materials. Unless and until

Page 1

<PAGE>

Depositor makes the initial deposit with DSI, DSI shall have no obligation with
respect to this Agreement, except the obligation to notify the parties regarding
the status of the deposit account as required in Section 2.2 below.

1.3  Deposit Inspection. When DSI receives the Deposit Materials and the Exhibit
B, DSI will conduct a deposit inspection by visually matching the labeling of
the tangible media containing the Deposit Materials to the item descriptions and
quantity listed on the Exhibit B. In addition to the deposit inspection, either
Beneficiary may elect to cause a verification of the Deposit Materials in
accordance with Section 1.6(b) below.

1.4  Acceptance of Deposit. At completion of the deposit inspection, if DSI
determines that the labeling of the tangible media matches the item descriptions
and quantity on Exhibit B, DSI will date and sign the Exhibit B and mail a copy
thereof to Depositor and each Beneficiary. If DSI determines that the labeling
does not match the item descriptions or quantity on the Exhibit B, DSI will (a)
note the discrepancies in writing on the Exhibit B; (b) date and sign the
Exhibit B with the exceptions noted; and (c) mail a copy of the Exhibit B to
Depositor and each Beneficiary. DSI's acceptance of the deposit occurs upon the
signing of the Exhibit B by DSI. Delivery of the signed Exhibit B to each
Beneficiary is such Beneficiary's notice that the Deposit Materials have been
received and accepted by DSI.

1.5  Depositor's Representations. Depositor represents as follows:

     a.   Depositor lawfully possesses all of the Deposit Materials deposited
          with DSI;

     b.   With respect to all of the Deposit Materials, Depositor has the right
          and authority to grant to DSI and Beneficiaries the rights as provided
          in this Agreement;

     c.   The Deposit Materials are subject only to the lien or other
          encumbrance specified in the Collateral Agreement;

     d.   The Deposit Materials consist of the proprietary technology and other
          materials identified either in the Collateral Agreement or Exhibit A,
          as the case may be; and

     e.   The Deposit Materials are readable and useable in their current form
          or, if any portion of the Deposit Materials is encrypted, the
          decryption tools and decryption keys have also been deposited.

1.6  Verification.

     a. DSI shall perform a Level I verification of the Deposit Materials upon
the initial deposit and for each update, meaning that DSI will cause a
technically qualified DSI employee to evaluate the initial Deposit Materials and
each update in order to ensure that all necessary information to run software
code has been included in the Deposit Materials. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, this means that DSI will identify: (i) the hardware and
software configurations reasonably necessary to maintain the Deposit Materials;
(b) the hardware and software configurations reasonably necessary to compile the
Deposit Materials; and (c) the compilation instructions. DSI will then prepare
and deliver to Depositor and each of the Beneficiaries a report describing the
information so identified, plus media functionality and virus

Page 2

<PAGE>

scanning results, program content confirmation, identification of third-party
libraries, potential obstructions, and recommendations for ensuring a complete
deposit. It shall be the responsibility of the Depositor, and not DSI, to ensure
that the Deposit Materials contain the information so identified in DSI's
report, as well as any other information that may be required in the Collateral
Agreement.

     b. In addition to the Level I verifications which are required by Section
1.6(a), each of the Beneficiaries shall have the right, at such Beneficiary's
expense, to cause higher level verifications of any Deposit Materials. Each
requesting Beneficiary shall notify Depositor and DSI of such Beneficiary's
request for verification. Depositor shall have the right to be present at the
verification. A verification determines, in different levels of detail, the
accuracy, completeness, sufficiency and quality of the Deposit Materials. If a
verification is elected after the Deposit Materials have been delivered to DSI,
then only DSI, or at DSI's election an independent person or company selected
and supervised by DSI, may perform the verification.

1.7  Deposit Updates. Unless otherwise provided by the Collateral Agreement,
Depositor shall update the Deposit Materials within 60 days of each release or
development of a new version of the product or technology which is subject to
the Collateral Agreement. Such updates will be added to the existing deposit.
All deposit updates shall be listed on a new Exhibit B and the new Exhibit B
shall be signed by Depositor. Each Exhibit B will be held and maintained
separately within the escrow account. An independent record will be created
which will document the activity for each Exhibit B. The processing of all
deposit updates shall be in accordance with Sections 1.2 through 1.6 above. All
references in this Agreement to the Deposit Materials shall include the initial
Deposit Materials and any updates.

1.8  Removal of Deposit Materials. The Deposit Materials may be removed and/or
exchanged only on written instructions signed by Depositor and each Beneficiary,
or as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2  -- CONFIDENTIALITY AND RECORD KEEPING

2.1  Confidentiality. DSI shall maintain the Deposit Materials in a secure,
environmentally safe, locked facility which is accessible only to authorized
representatives of DSI. DSI shall have the obligation to reasonably protect the
confidentiality of the Deposit Materials. Except as provided in this Agreement,
DSI shall not disclose, transfer, make available, or use the Deposit Materials.
DSI shall not disclose the content of this Agreement to any third party. If DSI
receives a subpoena or other order of a court or other judicial tribunal
pertaining to the disclosure or release of the Deposit Materials, DSI will
immediately notify the parties to this Agreement unless prohibited by law. It
shall be the responsibility of Depositor and/or Beneficiaries to challenge any
such order; provided, however, that DSI does not waive its rights to present its
position with respect to any such order. DSI will not be required to disobey any
court or other judicial tribunal order. (See Section 7.5 below for notices of
requested orders.)

2.2  Status Reports. DSI will issue to Depositor and each Beneficiary a report
profiling the account history at least semi-annually. DSI may provide copies of
the account history pertaining to this Agreement upon the request of any party
to this Agreement.

2.3  Audit Rights. During the term of this Agreement, Depositor and each
Beneficiary shall each have the right to inspect the written records of DSI
pertaining to this Agreement. Any inspection shall be held during normal
business hours and following reasonable prior notice.

ARTICLE 3  --  GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DSI

3.1  Title to Media. Depositor hereby transfers to DSI the title to the media
upon which the proprietary technology and materials are written or stored.
However, this transfer does not include the ownership of the proprietary
technology and materials contained on the media such as any copyright, trade
secret, patent or other intellectual property rights.

3.2  Right to Make Copies. DSI shall have the right to make copies of the
Deposit Materials as reasonably necessary to perform this Agreement. DSI shall
copy all copyright, nondisclosure, and other proprietary notices and titles
contained on the Deposit Materials onto any copies made by DSI. With all Deposit
Materials submitted to DSI, Depositor shall provide any and all instructions as
may be necessary to duplicate the Deposit Materials including but not limited to
the hardware and/or software needed.

3.3  Right to Transfer Upon Release. Depositor hereby grants to DSI the right to
transfer the Deposit Materials to both Beneficiaries upon any release of the
Deposit Materials for use by each Beneficiary in accordance with Section 4.3.
Except upon such a release or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, DSI shall
not transfer the Deposit Materials.

ARTICLE 4  -- RELEASE OF DEPOSIT

4.1  Release Conditions. As used in this Agreement, "Release Condition" shall
mean the following:

     a.   The occurrence of an Event of Default; or

     b.   Depositor's failure to continue to do business in the ordinary course.

4.2  Release. If either Beneficiary believes in good faith that a Release
Condition has occurred, such Beneficiary may provide to DSI an affidavit, from
an officer, certifying the occurrence of the Release Condition and a request for
the release of the Deposit Materials. Upon receipt of such affidavit, DSI is
authorized and shall release the Deposit Materials to each of the Beneficiaries.
DSI shall not be required to inquire into the truth of the affidavit or evaluate
the merit of the affidavit. DSI may not refuse to deliver the Deposit Material.
DSI shall provide Depositor with a copy of the requesting Beneficiary's
affidavit and notice of DSI's delivery of the Deposit Materials to each of the
Beneficiaries. This Agreement will terminate upon the release of the Deposit
Materials held by DSI.

4.3  Right to Use Following Release. Unless otherwise provided in the Collateral
Agreement, upon release of the Deposit Materials in accordance with this Article
4, each of the Beneficiaries shall have the right to use the Deposit Materials,
as provided in the Collateral Agreement, for the sole purpose of exercising the
rights and benefits afforded to such Beneficiary by the Collateral Agreement.
Subject to each Beneficiary's right to sell and/or license the Deposit Materials
in

Page 4

Agreement, Beneficiaries shall be obligated to maintain the confidentiality of
the released Deposit Materials.

one year. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew from year-to-year

DSI within one month of the date of such notice, then DSI shall have the right

termination to all parties. DSI shall have no obligation to take any action
under this Agreement so long as any payment due to DSI remains unpaid.

5.3  Disposition of Deposit Materials Upon Termination. Upon termination of this
Agreement, DSI shall destroy, return, or otherwise deliver the Deposit Materials
in accordance with Depositor's instructions. If there are no instructions, DSI

6.1  Fee Schedule. DSI is entitled to be paid its standard fees and expenses
applicable to the services provided. Depositor shall pay all such fees hereunder
to DSI, and DSI shall notify Depositor of DSI's fees at least 60 days prior to
any increase in fees. For any service not listed on DSI's standard fee schedule,
DSI will provide a quote prior to rendering the service, if requested.

6.2  Payment Terms. DSI shall not be required to perform any service unless the
payment for such service and any outstanding balances owed to DSI are paid in
full. Fees are due upon receipt of a signed contract or receipt of the Deposit

amounts shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month
(18% per annum) from the date of the invoice.

ARTICLE 7  --  LIABILITY AND DISPUTES

7.1  Right to Rely on Instructions. DSI may act in reliance upon any
instruction, instrument, or signature reasonably believed by DSI to be genuine.

written notice, request, or instruction has the authority to do so. DSI shall
not be responsible for failure to act as a result of causes beyond the
reasonable control of DSI. DSI will not be required to inquire into the truth,
or evaluate the merit, of any statement or representation contained in any
notice or document.

7.2  Indemnification. Depositor and Beneficiaries each agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless DSI from any and all claims, actions, damages,
arbitration fees and expenses, costs, attorney's fees and other liabilities
("Liabilities") incurred by DSI relating in any way to this escrow arrangement
except to the extent such Liabilities were caused by the negligence or willful
conduct of DSI.

7.3  Dispute Resolution. Any dispute relating to or arising from this Agreement
shall be resolved by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Three arbitrators shall be selected. The Depositor and
each Beneficiary shall each select one arbitrator. However, if DSI is a party to
the arbitration, the Beneficiaries shall jointly select one arbitrator, and DSI
shall select the third arbitrator. Unless otherwise agreed by Depositor and
Beneficiaries, arbitration will take place in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. Any
court having jurisdiction over the matter may enter judgment on the award of the
arbitrator(s). Service of a petition to confirm the arbitration award may be
made by First Class mail or by commercial express mail, to the attorney for the
party or, if unrepresented, to the party at the last known business address.

7.4  Controlling Law. This Agreement is to be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its
conflict of law provisions.

7.5  Notice of Requested Order. If any party intends to obtain an order from the
arbitrator or any court of competent jurisdiction which may direct DSI to take,
or refrain from taking any action, that party shall:

Page 6

<PAGE>

     a.   Give DSI at least two business days' prior notice of the hearing;

     b.   Include in any such order that, as a precondition to DSI's obligation,
          DSI be paid in full for any past due fees and be paid for the
          reasonable value of the services to be rendered pursuant to such
          order; and

     c.   Ensure that DSI not be required to deliver the original (as opposed to
          a copy) of the Deposit Materials if DSI may need to retain the
          original in its possession to fulfill any of its other duties.

ARTICLE 8  --  GENERAL PROVISIONS

8.1  Entire Agreement. This Agreement, which includes the Exhibits described
herein, embodies the entire understanding among the parties with respect to its
subject matter and supersedes all previous communications, representations or
understandings, either oral or written. DSI is not a party to any of the
documents which constitute the Collateral Agreement between Depositor and
Beneficiaries and has no knowledge of any of the terms or provisions of any such
Collateral Agreement. DSI's only obligations to Depositor or Beneficiaries are
as set forth in this Agreement. No amendment or modification of this Agreement
shall be valid or binding unless signed by all the parties hereto, except that
Exhibit A need not be signed by DSI, Exhibit B need not be signed by
Beneficiaries and Exhibit C need not be signed.

8.2  Notices. All notices, invoices, payments, deposits and other documents and
communications shall be given to the parties at the addresses specified in the

other as provided in this Section in the event of a change of address. The
parties shall have the right to rely on the last known address of the other
parties. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all documents and
communications may be delivered by First Class mail.

8.3  Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be
invalid, voidable or unenforceable, the parties agree that unless it materially
affects the entire intent and purpose of this Agreement, such invalidity,
voidability or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of this
Agreement nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question
shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most
closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.

8.4  Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties. However, DSI shall have no
obligation in performing this Agreement to recognize any successor or assign of
Depositor or of either Beneficiary unless DSI receives clear, authoritative and
conclusive written evidence of the change of parties.

8.5  Regulations. Depositor and Beneficiaries are responsible for and warrant
compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not
limited to customs laws, import, export, and re-export laws and government
regulations of any country from or to which the Deposit Materials may be
delivered in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
