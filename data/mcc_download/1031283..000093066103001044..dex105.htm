to derives value from the fact that it is not generally known and used by others in the highly competitive, international industry in which Entrust competes. The Employee further acknowledges and agrees that, even in complete good faith, it would be
impossible for the Employee to work in a similar capacity for a competitor of Entrust without drawing upon and utilizing information gained during employment with Entrust. Accordingly, at all times during the Employee&#146;s employment with Entrust
