<B><P>SECTION NINE. LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT</P>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>Grant of Limited Stock Appreciation Right.</LI>
</B><P>The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant a Limited Stock Appreciation Right to the holder of any stock option granted under the Plan.</P>
<P>A Limited Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with respect to a stock option at the time of its grant or any time thereafter up to six months prior to its expiration.</P>
<B><LI>Exercise of Limited Stock Appreciation Right.</LI></OL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Limited Stock Appreciation Rights will be automatically exercised one day after an event of Change of Control (as defined in Section Eleven). A Limited Stock Appreciation Right cannot be exercised in any other manner. Notwithstanding the above, a Limited Stock Appreciation Right will only be exercised if the Change in Control event occurred six months after the date of the grant of the Limited Stock Appreciation Right and the stock option to which it relates has not previously been exercised.</P>
<P>The exercise of a Limited Stock Appreciation Right will cancel any related stock option and allow the holder to receive in cash an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of one share of common stock over the option price, multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by the related stock option.</P>
<P>In the event of an exercise of a Limited Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares reserved for issuance shall be reduced by the number of shares covered by the Stock Option Award.</P></DIR>

<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>Grant of Performance Shares.</LI>
</B><P>A Performance Share is the right to receive a payment from the Company with respect to such Performance Share subject to satisfaction of such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. Performance Shares shall be credited to a Performance Share account to be maintained for each Participant. Each Performance Share shall be deemed to be equivalent of one share of common stock. The Award of Performance Shares under the Plan shall not entitle the participant to any interest in or to any dividend, voting, or other rights of a stockholder of the Company.</P>
<P>A grant of Performance Shares may be made by the Committee during the term of the Plan.</P>
<P>The Participant shall be entitled to receive payment for each Performance Share of an amount based on the achievement of performance measures for such Award Period as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to establish requirements or other criteria for measuring performance prior to the beginning of the Award Period but subject to such later revisions as the Committee shall deem appropriate to reflect significant or unforeseen events or changes.</P>
<B><LI>Form and Timing of Payment.</LI></OL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Except in the event of a Change of Control, no payment in respect of Performance Shares shall be made prior to the end of an Award Period. Payment thereafter shall be made as soon as practicable.</P>
<P>The payment to which a Participant shall be entitled at the end of an Award Period shall be a dollar amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common stock equal to the number of Performance Shares earned. Payment shall normally be made in common stock. The Committee, however, may authorize payment in such combinations of cash and common stock or all in cash as it deems appropriate.</P>
<P>The number of shares of common stock to be paid to a Participant will be determined by dividing the portion of the payment not paid in cash by (i)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of the common stock on the date on which the shares are issued; or (ii)&nbsp;the price per share paid for shares purchased for a Participant's account should the Board determine to purchase common stock on behalf of the Participant. Stock received in settlement of Performance Shares may not be disposed of within six months of the date on which the Performance Shares were granted.</P></DIR>

</B><P>In the event of Change in Control (as defined below)&nbsp;of the Company, and except as the Committee may expressly provide otherwise, (i)&nbsp;all Stock Options then outstanding shall become fully exercisable unless Limited Stock Appreciation Rights were granted in connection with the Stock Options which in such event the Limited Stock Appreciation Rights will be automatically exercised as provided for in Section Nine herein; (ii)&nbsp;all restrictions (other than restrictions imposed by law) and conditions of all Restricted stock Grants then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied as of the date of the Change in Control; and (iii)&nbsp;all Performance Share Grants shall be deemed to have been fully earned as of the date of the Change in Control, subject to the limitation that any Award which has been outstanding less than six months on the date of the Change in Control shall not be afforded such treatment.</P>
<P>A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if (i)&nbsp;any person other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, and other than the Company or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the Shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the Common stock of the Company then outstanding; or (ii)&nbsp;during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in (i) above) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's Shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3)&nbsp;of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof.</P>
<B><P>SECTION TWELVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORFEITURE</P>
</B><P>In the event a Participant ceases employment, restricted stock for which the restriction period has not expired and Performance Shares are subject to forfeiture as follows:</P><DIR>

<P>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability - payout of the Award would be prorated for service during the period.</P>
<P>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death - payout of the Award would be prorated for service during the period.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P><HR></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>In any instance where payout of an Award is to be prorated, the Committee may choose to provide the Participant (or the Participant's estate)&nbsp;with the entire Award rather than the prorated portion thereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restricted stock which is forfeited will be transferred to the Company or canceled and made available again for the grant of an Award under the Plan.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECTION THIRTEEN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFERRAL ELECTION</P>

<B><P>SECTION FOURTEEN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMENDMENT OF PLAN</P>
</B><P>The Board may at any time and from time to time alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part, except (i)&nbsp;no such action may be taken without shareholder approval which increases the benefits accruing to Participants pursuant to the Plan, increases the number of shares of Common stock which may be issued pursuant to the Plan (except as provided in Section Fifteen I), extends the period for granting Options under the Plan, modifies the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or requires shareholder approval under any law or regulation in effect at the time such amendment is proposed for adoption; (ii)&nbsp;no such action may be taken without the consent of the Participant to whom any Award shall theretofore have been granted, which adversely affects the rights of such Participant concerning such Award, except as such termination or amendment of the Plan is required by statute, or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (iii)&nbsp;no such action may be taken if the proposed amendment must be in the discretion of the Committee to comply with the disinterested administration requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.</P>
