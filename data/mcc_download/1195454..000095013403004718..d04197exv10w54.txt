         Re: November 1, 2002 -- May 1, 2003 Employment Agreement

Dear Frank:

         This letter is to memorialize the terms and conditions of the agreement
reached between you and Williams Communications, LLC (the "Company") on October
29, 2002 regarding your continued employment by the Company from November 1,
2002 until May 1, 2003, as follows:

      1. You will no longer serve as Chief Operating Officer of the Company
         and of its parent, WilTel Communications Group, Inc. You will instead
         serve as a senior executive of both companies, and the compensation and
         benefits to which you are entitled as of the date of this agreement
         will remain unchanged. You will assist the Chief Executive Officer as
         directed, assist in customer and potential customer marketing efforts,
         and perform other duties assigned by the CEO and Board of Directors
         which are consistent with your position as a senior executive.

      2. As of May 1, 2003, your employment may be terminated either by you or
         by the Company. In the event of such termination, you will receive
         severance benefits equal to those that you would be entitled to receive
         as Chief Operating Officer under the Williams Communications Group,
         Inc. Severance Protection Plan (the "Plan"), if your employment had
         involuntarily terminated due to Severance, as that term is defined in
         the Plan, as of the date of this agreement. You will be entitled to
         receive these benefits regardless of whether the decision to terminate
         your employment is yours or the Company's.

      3. The Company reserves the right to terminate your employment before
         May 1, 2003. In that event, you will receive the total compensation,
         benefits and severance you would have been entitled to under sections 1
         and 2 above had you remained employed until May 1, unless you are
         terminated for Cause, as defined in the Plan.

      4. Nothing in this agreement is intended to alter the ability of you
         and the Company to continue your employment after May 1, 2003, upon
         mutually agreeable terms.
