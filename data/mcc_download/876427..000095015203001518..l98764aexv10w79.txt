        IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, and

which are hereby acknowledged, VALVOLINE hereby agrees to sell and deliver, and
CUSTOMER hereby agrees to purchase, receive and pay for, the Valvoline(R)
products described below at CUSTOMER'S premises identified on the attached
Schedule A, and any future locations the CUSTOMER may acquire, open or operate
on the following terms and conditions:

        1.      TERM. This Agreement shall be in effect for a term of ***
years from November 1, 2002. CUSTOMER expressly agrees that the consideration
for this Agreement is independent of any other agreement between CUSTOMER and

the provisions hereof regardless of the termination or expiration of any other
agreement between CUSTOMER and VALVOLINE.

        2.      PRODUCTS. VALVOLINE shall sell and deliver, and CUSTOMER shall
purchase, pay and provide safe access for the delivery of the following
VALVOLINE(R) products ("Products"):

        (i)     Valvoline(R) motor oils, greases and other lubricants and/or
                other automotive products the CUSTOMER may choose offered for
                sale by VALVOLINE (including bulk and packaged products),
                subject only to Section 5 hereof.

        Customer shall exclusively use and/or sell Products at all of its
current and future locations and shall purchase, at a minimum, *** gallons of
Valvoline oils and greases each year (November 1 to October 31 the following
year) this Agreement is in effect. In the event Customer purchases at least ***
gallons but less than *** gallons in a year, the shortage shall be carried
forward and, together with the shortage from any other year, be purchased by
Customer within 180 days following the term of this Agreement.

        3.      PRICE/PAYMENT. For Products sold and delivered hereunder,
CUSTOMER shall pay VALVOLINE's applicable prices as established on Schedule B on
the date of delivery. Prices are subject to change upon written notice to
CUSTOMER and such notice shall be delivered to CUSTOMER at least sixty (60) days
in advance. *** Any future price adjustments shall generally allow CUSTOMER to
remain competitive with comparable products sold by CUSTOMER's competitors.
CUSTOMER is responsible for payment of all applicable taxes, fees and other
government-imposed charges, whether or not included in such prices. If
compliance with law prevents VALVOLINE from charging or CUSTOMER from paying the
price provided in this Agreement, any resulting failure to perform shall be
excused pursuant to Section 5 hereof. Each delivery hereunder shall be
considered a separate sale.

        4.      PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION. VALVOLINE shall have the right at any
time to change or discontinue use of any trademark, service mark, grade
designation, trade dress, trade name or other indication of source of origin
("Marks") under which the Products are sold. If VALVOLINE discontinues the use
of any Mark which the CUSTOMER, in its sole discretion, deems as being
detrimental to its on-going business, the CUSTOMER shall have the right to
terminate this agreement under the conditions outlined below. CUSTOMER shall use
its best efforts to maintain the quality, good name and reputation of VALVOLINE
and the Products. Only the Products shall be stored or sold using any equipment
or container which bears the Marks. VALVOLINE grants to CUSTOMER a license to
use the Marks only to identify the Products, and store and advertise the
Products. CUSTOMER shall not


                                       28
<PAGE>

alter in composition, co-mingle with products from other sources, or otherwise
adulterate the Products. CUSTOMER shall not bring or cause to be brought any
proceedings, either administrative or judicial in nature, contesting VALVOLINE's
ownership of rights to, or registrations of the Marks.

        5.      FORCE MAJEURE. The parties to this Agreement shall not be
responsible for any delay or failure to perform under this Agreement (other than
to make payments when due hereunder) if delayed or prevented from performing by
act of God; transportation difficulty; strike or other industrial disturbance;
any law, regulation, ruling, order or action of any governmental authority; any
allocation or shortage of product, as determined by VALVOLINE in its sole
discretion; or any other cause or causes beyond such party's reasonable control
whether similar or dissimilar to those stated above.

        6.      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS/TAXES. CUSTOMER shall, at its own expense,
(i) comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rulings and orders, including
without limitation those relating to taxation, workers' compensation, and
environmental protection; (ii) obtain all necessary licenses and permits for the
purchase and sale of the Products; and (iii) pay directly, or reimburse
VALVOLINE on demand if paid by VALVOLINE, all taxes, inspection fees, import
fees, and other governmental charges imposed upon this Agreement, the Products,
or on the sale, purchase, handling, storage, advertising, distribution, resale
or use of the Products.

        7.      VALVOLINE'S RIGHT TO INSPECT. VALVOLINE, or its authorized
agents, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to inspect CUSTOMER's
premises, sample, monitor or test any motor oil, grease or filter offered for
sale, and to inspect or test any tank, line, pump, dispenser, or other operating
equipment, including without limitation equipment owned by Customer, used at
CUSTOMER's premises bearing the Marks, or being represented to contain the
Products, at any time during business hours.

        8.      TERMINATION; REMEDIES. This Agreement may be terminated only by
mutual consent of the parties in writing or if any one or more of the following
events occur during the term of this Agreement:

                (i)     CUSTOMER defaults in the performance of or breaches any
provision of Section 4 of this Agreement and fails to cure such default within

benefit of that party's creditor(s); or

                (vi)    VALVOLINE is acquired, either directly or indirectly,

                (vii)   The CUSTOMER is acquired, either directly or indirectly,
through the sale of assets, merger, or otherwise.

        Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or otherwise restrict
any right, power, or remedy of either party. All rights, powers, and remedies
shall be cumulative and concurrent and the exercise of one or more rights,
powers or remedies existing under this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity, shall not preclude the subsequent exercise by either party of
any other right, power or remedy.

        In the event that a change of control of VALVOLINE shall result in a
party, person or corporate entity controlling a majority share of VALVOLINE and
such party, person or corporate entity shall be a citizen of, or based in, a
country which is, or becomes, listed on the United States of America's
Department of State's Office of Defense Trade Control's Embargo Reference Chart,
the CUSTOMER shall have the immediate right to terminate this agreement without
penalty, assessment of liquidated damages or prior notification.

and CUSTOMER shall make no representation to the contrary.

        13.     TIME OF THE ESSENCE/WAIVER. In performing all obligations under
this Agreement, time is of the essence. The failure of any party hereto to
exercise any right such party may have with respect to breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not impair or be deemed a waiver of such party's rights
with respect to any continuing or subsequent breach of the same or any other
provision of this Agreement.

        14.     EXECUTION AND ACCEPTANCE. This Agreement or any modification
hereof shall not be binding upon VALVOLINE until it has been duly accepted by
VALVOLINE, as evidenced by the signature of one of VALVOLINE's authorized
officers or representatives in VALVOLINE's Lexington, Kentucky offices, with an
executed counterpart delivered to CUSTOMER. Commencement of business between the
parties prior to such acceptance, signature and delivery of a counterpart shall
not be construed as a waiver by VALVOLINE of this condition.

        15.     ENTIRETY OF CONTRACT. This writing is intended by the parties as
the final, complete and exclusive statement of the terms, conditions and
specifications of their agreement and is intended to supersede all previous oral
or written agreements and understandings between the parties relating to its
specific subject matter. No employee or agent of VALVOLINE has authority to make
any statement, representation, promise or agreement not contained in this
Agreement. No prior stipulation, agreement, understanding or course of dealing
between the parties or their agents with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement shall be valid or enforceable unless embodied in this Agreement. No
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
valid or enforceable unless in writing and signed by all parties to this
Agreement. This Agreement shall supersede, and shall not be modified or amended
in any way by the terms of, any purchase order which may be issued by CUSTOMER
for the purchase of product hereunder.

        16.     SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance is held invalid,
the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance and the
remainder of this Agreement will not be affected thereby and will remain in full
effect.

        17.     GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED
AND SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE AT LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY. Any dispute, claim
or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any of the
Agreements attached hereto as exhibits) or breach, termination or validity
thereof, may be, by mutual



                                       31

consent of the parties, settled by arbitration conducted expeditiously in
accordance with the commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"). Within ten (10) business days of the filing of arbitration,
the parties shall select a sole independent and impartial arbitrator in
accordance with such Rules. If the parties mutually agree to arbitration, but
are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within such period, the AAA will appoint

entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, either party may seek remedies through the courts, including, without
limitation, injunctive relief, prior and without prejudice to arbitration in
accordance with this provision. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
HEREUNDER.

                Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Valvoline
shall not be liable in any arbitration, litigation or other proceeding for
anything other than actual, compensatory damages.

                not automatically renew upon its expiration. If mutually
                desired, the Parties agree to terminate this agreement and
                replace it with another Agreement prior to the expiration of the
                established term of this Agreement.

        19.     EXISTING UNAMORTIZED EQUIPMENT. VALVOLINE agrees to reimburse

            remaining value of said equipment will be payable to VALVOLINE
            within thirty (30) days of termination as outlined in paragraph 8
            above.
