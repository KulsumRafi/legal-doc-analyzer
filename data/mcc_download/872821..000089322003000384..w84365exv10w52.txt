                     BALENTINE DELAWARE HOLDING COMPANY, LLC

         This Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
"Agreement") of Balentine Delaware Holding Company, LLC (the "LLC") is made as
of January 2, 2002, among Balentine Holdings, Inc., a Georgia corporation

the Insurance Trust and other employees of the LLC subsequently admitted to the
LLC as members in accordance herewith hereinafter are sometimes collectively
referred to as the "Principals"). This Agreement amends and restates in its
entirety the LLC's Operating Agreement dated as of October 23, 2001 (the
"Original LLC Agreement"), executed by Balentine and, pursuant to certain
Joinder Agreements dated as of January 2, 2002, by the Principals (collectively,
the "Second LLC Agreement").

                                   BACKGROUND

         A. Immediately prior to the Merger (as hereinafter defined), the
Principals owned all of the outstanding shares of capital stock in Balentine.

         B. Immediately prior to the Merger, Balentine owned all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of Balentine & Company, a Georgia

General Partner, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("GP"), and 47.2% of
the limited liability company interests in Balentine & Company of Tennessee,
L.L.C. ("BCT").

         C. The LLC has heretofore been formed as a limited liability company
under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, 6 Del. C.[sec][sec] 18-101 et
seq., as amended from time to time (the "Delaware Act"), by filing a Certificate
of Formation of the LLC with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware on
October 18, 2001 (the "Certificate").

         D. Immediately before the events described in Recital E below, BC was
converted into a Georgia limited liability company.

         E. Pursuant to a Contribution Agreement dated January 2, 2002,
Balentine, immediately before the Merger, contributed all of its assets to the
LLC (which assumed all of Balentine's liabilities) (the value of such assets net
of such liabilities being $[*] (the "Initial Capital Contribution"), in
exchange for which the LLC issued a 100% capital interest and 100% profits
interest to Balentine, and executed the Original LLC Agreement. Immediately
after the foregoing contribution and before the Merger, Balentine distributed to
the Principals, as its shareholders, an aggregate 20% profits interest and a
partially subordinated capital interest in the LLC (collectively valued at
$[*]), retaining the remaining capital interest and an 80% profits interest
therein (the "Distribution"), and the LLC and the Principals executed the
Joinder

Agreements, constituting, together with the Original LLC Agreement, the

Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Subsidiary with the Office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware on October 17, 2001.

         G. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement dated
October 23, 2001, WTC and the Principals effected the merger of Merger
Subsidiary with and into Balentine (the "Merger"), with Balentine surviving the
Merger.

outstanding shares of capital stock of Balentine to WTI.

guaranteeing the performance of Balentine hereunder pursuant to Section 7.12 and
committing to the undertakings in Section 12.2.

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Annual Compound Growth                       Multiple
<S>                                          <C>
Below [*]%                                   [*]times

Over [*]%                                    [*]times
</TABLE>

Annual compound growth in the Run Rate between [*]% and [*]% shall be
interpolated proportionately. The initial value used for the calculation of the
compound growth rate that will determine the earn out payment multiple will be
the Base Run Rate. The initial computation of the annual compound growth rate
for 2002 shall be determined by dividing the Base Run Rate into the Run Rate for
Fiscal Year 2002, subtracting one from the result and converting that result
into a percentage. For example, if the Base Run Rate were 2000 and the Run Rate
for 2002 were 2400, the annual compound growth for 2002 would be 20% and the
multiple for 2002 would be [*]. The annual compound growth rate for subsequent
years would be determined on a compound basis beginning with Fiscal Year 2003.

Valuation.

indicating his intent to resign and the effective date of his resignation.

necessary to designate a Manager may remove and replace such Manager previously
designated by them at any time upon written notice to the LLC.

         Section 5.4. Vacancies. If a Manager resigns or is removed from the

meeting waives the attendee's right to any notice required hereunder unless the
Person attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully
called or convened.

         Section 5.6. Quorum. At any meeting of the Board, the presence of three

extent of their powers set forth herein, the Managers are agents of the LLC for
purposes of the LLC's business, and the actions of the Managers taken in
accordance with those powers shall bind the LLC. No Member, in that Person's
capacity as Member, acting individually or with all Members, and no Managers
representing less than the number of Managers necessary for Board action under
Sections 5.1, 5.7 or 5.13(d) may bind the LLC. The Managers representing the
number of Managers necessary for Board action under Article 5 may bind the LLC.

         Section 5.10. Duty of Managers. A Manager is required to act in good
faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the LLC
and shall be deemed to owe the same fiduciary duty to the LLC as a director of a
Delaware corporation is deemed to owe the corporation under Delaware law.

         Section 5.11. Approval of Annual Budget. The Board alone shall have the
power to approve the LLC's annual budget. If the LLC's annual budget is not
approved in its entirety by the Board under this Section 5.11, the Board shall
approve the budget to the extent of those items on which there is agreement, and
shall continue to negotiate in good faith until all items of the budget are
agreed upon.

         Section 5.12. Officers. The Board may appoint agents and employees of
the LLC who are designated as officers of the LLC (each, an "Officer"). The
Officers shall at all times include a Chairman, a President, a Chief Executive
Officer and a Secretary and may from time to time

                                     -18-
<PAGE>
include a Vice Chairman, one or more Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice
Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Secretaries and such other Officers
as the Board may approve. The initial Officers shall be as set forth on
Schedule 2. The Board may remove any Officer at any time, for any reason, in
its sole and absolute discretion. The Officers shall be agents of the LLC,
authorized to execute and deliver documents and take other actions on the LLC's
behalf, subject to the direction of the Board, and to have such other duties as
the Board may approve, provided that the delegation of any such power and
authority to the Officers shall not limit in any respect the power and
authority of the Board to take such actions or any other action on the LLC's
behalf as provided herein. The Secretary shall record the actions of the Board,
certify this Agreement and any related document or instrument, certify Board
resolutions, incumbency and other matters of the LLC, and have such other
ministerial duties as the Board may specify from time to time.

         Section 5.13. Powers of the Board; Powers of Officers.

         a.    Subject to the provisions hereof and of the Delaware Act
requiring the approval of Members, the Board's powers on behalf and in respect
of the LLC shall be all powers and privileges permitted to be exercised by
managers of the LLC under the Delaware Act (including Section 18-402 of the
Delaware Act), including the authority, power and discretion to manage and
control the business operations, affairs and properties of the LLC, to make all
decisions regarding those matters and to perform any and all other acts or
activities customary or incident to the management of the LLC's business
operations, including, without limitation, the right and power to hire and
terminate employees, and determine salaries, bonuses and other employee benefits
for the employees of the LLC.

         b.    Except to the extent that this Agreement requires the Board to
vote on a matter, the Board may delegate any of its powers to the Officers or
any one or more of them.

         c.    Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5.13(b), the Board
hereby delegates to the respective Officers the respective powers delegated to
officers of a corporation under Delaware's General Corporation Law, subject to
the powers of a board of directors of a corporation under Delaware law. Any
documents signed by such Officers with the foregoing delegation shall be binding
on the LLC as if signed by the number of Managers required to approve such
action. The Board reserves the right to rescind the delegation of any such
powers at any time in its sole discretion.

         d.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the approval of all of the
Managers, the Board has no authority to:

               (1)   amend this Agreement or, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, the Certificate;

               (2)   issue new LLC Interests;

sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or any
substantial part of the property or assets of the LLC or any Subsidiary of the
LLC (other than pursuant to the BCT Agreement), or liquidate, dissolve or wind
up, or undertake any similar transaction or authorize, announce, make proposals
or seek offers for, or enter into any binding or nonbinding arrangements,
understandings or agreements with respect to any transaction or transactions
with a similar effect to the foregoing, except in all cases with, into, or to
any Person that is an Affiliate of the LLC, WTC, or WTI;

               (6)   file a voluntary petition or otherwise initiate proceedings
(i) to have the LLC adjudicated insolvent, or (ii) seeking an order for relief
of the LLC as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.

reorganization, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under
the present or any future federal bankruptcy laws or any other present or

official) of the LLC or of all or any substantial part of the property or
assets of the LLC, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors
of the LLC, or admit in writing the inability of the LLC to pay its debts
generally as they become due, or declare or effect a moratorium on the LLC's

$250,000 in any Fiscal Year;

Fiscal Year;

                                     -20-

               (12)  make any election, or take or omit to take any action, that
would prevent the LLC from being taxed as a partnership for federal or state

Affiliates for the provision of investment advisory services that would be in
conflict with the LLC's business.

         Section 5.14. Reimbursement. The LLC shall reimburse each Manager and
Officer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses that Manager or
Officer incurs on an LLC's behalf according to terms the Board approves, except
that the LLC will not be required to reimburse any out-of-pocket travel expenses
of a Manager or Officer who has been designated by WTI. The Board's sole
determination of which expenses may be reimbursed to a Manager or an Officer and
the amount of those expenses shall be conclusive. Any such reimbursement shall
be treated as an expense of the LLC that shall be deducted in computing Profits
and Losses and, if made to a Manager or Officer that also is a Member, shall not
be deemed a distributive share of Profits or a distribution or return of capital
to such Manager or Officer.

                     ACCOUNTS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS

         Section 6.1. Capital Contributions.

         a.    Balentine, in exchange for the capital contribution set forth
opposite its name on Schedule 1 hereto (representing the Initial Capital
Contribution less the part thereof assigned to the Principals in connection with
the Distribution), has received an LLC Interest with the number of Membership
Points set forth there. Each Principal, in exchange for the part of the Initial
Capital Contribution assigned to him or it in connection with the Distribution
and set forth opposite his or its name on Schedule 1 under the heading "Capital
Contribution," has received an LLC Interest with the number of Membership Points
set forth there.

         b.    No Member shall be required to make any additional capital
contribution to the LLC, except with respect to any New Business Opportunity
approved by all of the Managers.

         Section 6.2. Capital Accounts.

         a.    Each Member shall have a Capital Account, which shall not bear
interest.

         b.    No Member has the right to demand a return of that Member's
capital contributions (or the balance of that Member's Capital Account). In
addition, no Member has the right to (1) demand and receive any distribution
from the LLC in any form other than cash or (2) bring an action of partition
against the LLC or its property.

         Section 6.3. Distributions of Cash.

         a.    Subject to Section 12.2(b)(2), within 15 days after the
availability of the year-end audit for each Fiscal Year, the Board shall cause
the LLC to distribute Free Cash Flow to the Members in proportion to the average
of their respective Membership Points held as of the close of each Accounting
Period in that Fiscal Year.

         b.    Subject to Section 12.2(b)(2) but notwithstanding Section 6.3(a),
the Board shall cause the LLC to make interim distributions of Free Cash Flow to
the Members within 30 days after the end of each of the four quarters in each
Fiscal Year, in proportion to the average of their respective Membership Points
held as of the close of each Accounting Period in such quarter; all such
distributions in any Fiscal Year shall be deemed advances against the
distribution required by Section 6.3(a) for such year. If any such distribution
is determined to be excessive by the Board, the Members shall repay, without
interest, the excessive portion of the distribution within 30 days after being
notified by the Board in writing of such determination.

         c.    The LLC is authorized to withhold from distributions, or with
respect to allocations, to the Members and to pay over to any federal, state or
local government any amount required to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or
any provision of any state or local tax law. All amounts so withheld, and all
amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any provision of any state or local tax
law with respect to any payment, distribution or allocation to the LLC, shall be
treated for all purposes hereof as amounts distributed pursuant to this Section
6.3 to the affected Member, or all the Members, as the case may be.

         d.    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the LLC
shall not make a distribution to any Member on account of its LLC Interest if
that distribution would (1) cause that Member to have a deficit balance in its
Capital Account or (2) violate Section 18-607 of the Delaware Act or other
applicable law.

         e.    The proceeds of a sale of all or substantially all of the LLC's
assets shall be distributed pursuant to Section 13.4(a) as if they were proceeds
of the LLC's liquidation.

         f.    If any LLC Interest is transferred during any Accounting Period,
Free Cash Flow for such period that is distributable to the holder thereof shall
be distributed in accordance with Section 6.7 (by substituting "Accounting
Period" for "Fiscal Year").

         a.    After giving effect to the special allocations provided in
Section 6.5, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(c), Profits for any
Fiscal Year or Accounting Period shall be allocated to the Members as follows:

               (1)  First, to each Member in an amount equal to the excess, if
          any, of (i) the cumulative Losses allocated to such Member pursuant to
          Section 6.4(b) for all prior Fiscal Years and prior Accounting Periods
          in the current Fiscal Year over (ii) the cumulative Profits allocated
          to such Member pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) for all such prior
          Fiscal Years and Accounting Periods; provided that, if the Profits of
          the current Fiscal Year or Accounting Period are less than the sum of
          such excess for all Members, such Profits shall be allocated to each
          Member in proportion to its share of such sum; and

               (2)  Second, to the Members in proportion to their respective
          Membership Points as of the end of that Fiscal Year or Accounting
          Period, as the case may be.

         b. After giving effect to the special allocations provided in Section
6.5, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(c), Losses for any Fiscal
Year or Accounting Period shall be allocated to the Members as follows:

               (1)  First, to each Member in an amount equal to the excess, if
         any, of (i) the cumulative Profits allocated to such Member pursuant to
         Section 6.4(a) for all prior Fiscal Years and prior Accounting Periods
         in the current Fiscal Year over (ii) the cumulative Losses allocated to
         such Member pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) for all such prior Fiscal
         Years and Accounting Periods; provided that, if the Losses of the
         current Fiscal Year or Accounting Period are less than the sum of such
         excess for all Members, such Losses shall be allocated to each Member
         in proportion to its share of such sum, and provided further that no
         current Fiscal Year Losses shall be allocated to any Member to the
         extent such allocation would cause such Member to have a deficit in its
         Capital Account;

               (2)  Second, to the Members in proportion to their respective
         Membership Points as of the end of that Fiscal Year or Accounting
         Period, as the case may be, up to the amount of their positive Capital
         Account balances as of that time; and

               (3)  Third, to the Members in proportion to their respective
         Capital Account balances as of the end of that Fiscal Year or
         Accounting Period, as the case may be.

         c.    Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a), Profits and Losses from the sale
of all or substantially all of the LLC's assets, and Profits and Losses from a
deemed sale of assets in connection with the liquidation of the LLC (as
described in Section 13.4(b)), shall be allocated among the Members in
proportion to distributions pursuant to Sections 13.4(a)(2) through (4).

         Section 6.5. Special Allocations.

         a.    If and to the extent any employee or Principal of the LLC or an
Affiliate recognizes or is deemed to recognize any item of income or gain
pursuant to Code Section 83 by virtue of any transaction or deemed transaction
between any Member and that employee, then any resulting item of loss the LLC
recognizes or deduction to which the LLC is entitled shall be specially
allocated to that Member.

         b.    The provisions of the Treasury Regulations under Code Section
704(b) relating to the qualified income offset, minimum gain chargeback, minimum
gain chargeback with respect to nonrecourse debt, allocation of nonrecourse
deductions and allocation of items of deduction, loss or expenditure relating to
nonrecourse debt hereby are incorporated herein by this reference and shall be
applied to the allocation of items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the
LLC. However, the Members do not intend to incorporate, by reference or
otherwise, the "deficit restoration obligation" described in Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) of the Treasury Regulations.

         c.    If items of income, gain, loss or deduction are allocated to one
or more Members pursuant to Section 6.5(b), subsequent items of income, gain,
loss or deduction shall first be allocated to the Members in a manner designed
to result in each Member's receiving an allocation of Profits and Losses through
the time of such subsequent allocation equal to what such Member would have
received in the absence of Section 6.5(b).

         Section 6.6. Allocations under Code Section 704(c).

         a.    In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any
property contributed to the LLC's capital shall, solely for tax purposes, be
allocated among the Members to take account of any variation between the LLC's
adjusted basis in that property for federal income tax purposes and its initial
Carrying Value at the time of its contribution to the LLC.

         b.    Allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to
any asset revalued in accordance with Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the
Treasury Regulations shall take account of any variation between the LLC's
adjusted basis in that asset for federal income tax purposes and its Carrying
Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and as required by Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) of the
Treasury Regulations.

         c.    Any elections or other decisions relating to allocations
described in Sections 6.6(b) or (c) shall be made by the Members in any manner
that reasonably reflects the purposes and intent hereof. Allocations pursuant to
Sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 are solely for purposes of federal, state and local
income taxes and shall not affect, nor in any way be taken into account in
computing, any Member's Capital Account balance, Free Cash Flow or other items
or distributions pursuant to any provision hereof.

         Section 6.7. Transfer of LLC Interests. If an LLC Interest is
transferred during any Fiscal Year (including to the LLC or another Member), the
Profits or Losses attributable to such

                                     -24-
<PAGE>
LLC Interest for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated, and the Free Cash Flow
for such year distributable to the holder thereof shall be distributed, between
the transferor and the transferee ("parties") in any manner permitted by law as
to which they agree; provided, however, that, if the LLC does not receive, on
or before January 31 of the year following the Fiscal Year in which the
transfer occurs, written notice from the transferor and the transferee stating
the manner in which the parties have agreed to allocate such Profits or Losses
and distributions of Free Cash Flow, then all such Profits or Losses and
distributions of Free Cash Flow shall be allocated between or made to the
parties based on the percentage of the year each of them was, according to the
LLC's books and records, the holder of the transferred LLC Interest.

                                   ARTICLE 7
           TRANSFER OF LLC INTERESTS, PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, CHANGE OF
                  CONTROL AND ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS

         Section 7.1. Assignability of Interests.

         a.    Except as otherwise provided in this Article 7, no LLC Interest
may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given, exchanged,
optioned or encumbered (each, a "Transfer"), and no Transfer in violation of
this Agreement shall be binding upon the LLC.

         b.    A Member may transfer all or any portion of its or his LLC
Interest to any one or more Permitted Transferees who agree to be bound by the
terms and conditions hereof; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the transferring Member shall retain the vote with
respect to the LLC Interest so Transferred to Permitted Transferees; provided,
however, if the Transferee is WTI or is consolidated with WTI for federal income
tax purposes, the Transferee shall become a Voting Member.

         Section 7.2. Put Options.

         a.    Except as provided in the next paragraph of this Section 7.2(a),
on or before February 28 of each year beginning in 2003, the Board shall notify
each Member of the LLC Value as of December 31 of the immediately preceding
year. The Board shall also furnish a certified copy of a balance sheet, income
statement, and cash flow statement of the LLC for each Fiscal Year, and
statement of such Member's Capital Account balance as of the end of that Fiscal
Year, all of which shall be audited by, and shall receive the unqualified
opinion of, the LLC's independent accounting firm, as if the LLC were
independent and not affiliated with WTC, to each Member promptly after they are
available.

         If the LLC's financial statements are unavailable until after February
28 of a year beginning in 2003, the Board shall notify, on or before February 28
of that year, each Member of the estimated LLC Value as of December 31 of the
immediately preceding year and shall notify each Member of the actual LLC Value
as promptly as possible after such financial statements

                                     -25-
<PAGE>
become available. If the Purchase Closing Date with respect to any LLC
Interests put pursuant to this Section 7.2 has not occurred, and the LLC Value
differs from the estimated LLC Value by 5% or more, each Principal and/or his
or its Permitted Transferees who or that has exercised his or its Put rights
shall have the right to rescind his and/or its decision to exercise of his or
its Put rights. If such Purchase Closing Date has occurred, each of the
Principals and/or his or its Permitted Transferees exercising the Put rights
with respect to his or its LLC Interest and the purchaser(s) of such LLC
Interest, as the case may be, shall remit to the other(s) the amount(s)
necessary to reflect appropriately the difference between the LLC Value and the
estimated LLC Value.

         b.    Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Section
7.2, each Principal (on behalf of himself and/or his or its Permitted
Transferees) may exercise an option to sell all or any portion of his or its LLC
Interest and associated Membership Points (each such exercise is referred to
herein as a "Put") at the Purchase Price therefor. Upon exercise of a Put under
this Section 7.2(b) by a Principal, the other Principals (the "Other
Principals") shall first have the right (in proportion to their Membership
Points or in such other proportions as the Principals' Representative may
determine) to purchase from that Principal or that Principal's Permitted
Transferees, as the case may be, all of that Principal's and his or its
Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests (or such portion as the Other Principals
agree to purchase). If the Other Principals do not elect to purchase all of that
Principal's and his or its Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests, Balentine shall
thereupon become obligated to purchase any remaining LLC Interests with respect
to which the Put has been exercised.

         c.    Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.2(b) to the
contrary, unless otherwise agreed to by Balentine: (1) a Principal (on behalf of
himself or itself and/or his or its Permitted Transferees) may not exercise a
Put prior to January 1, 2006; and (2) Puts may not be exercised in any year with
respect to LLC Interests and associated Membership Points representing more than
25% of the Membership Points of the LLC owned by a Principal and/or his
Permitted Transferees on December 31, 2005; provided, however, if a Put is not
exercised in full by a Principal or his Permitted Transferees for any year
beginning in 2006, that unexercised portion may be exercised at the time that a
Put is exercised for any subsequent year. For purposes of illustration if,
during 2006, a Principal and his Permitted Transferees exercised a Put for LLC
Interests associated with only 10% of the Membership Points held by them on
December 31, 2005, such Principal and his Permitted Transferees would then be
permitted during 2007 to exercise a Put in respect of LLC Interests associated
with 40% of the Membership Points held by them on December 31, 2005. In no
event, however, shall any Principal be entitled to Put LLC Interests associated
with more than 25% of the Membership Points owned by such Principal and/or his
Permitted Transferees on December 31, 2005 in 2006, 50% in 2007, 75% in 2008 and
100% in 2009. The restrictions on the Put rights described in this Section
7.2(c) apply solely to LLC Interests and associated Membership Points held by
the Principals or their Permitted Transferees as of the Closing (as defined in
the Merger Agreement); however, any subsequent holder of such LLC Interests
shall be entitled to exercise the Put right herein as if such holder were the
Principal or Permitted Transferee holding such LLC Interests as of the Closing.

<PAGE>
         d.    A Principal (on behalf of himself and/or his or its Permitted
Transferees) may exercise a Put if, on or before March 31 of any year (beginning
on January 1, 2006), Balentine and each Other Principal receives an irrevocable
notice of exercise of the Put substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a
"Put Notice") stating that he or it is electing to exercise the Put and
specifying the LLC Interests and associated Membership Points to be sold
pursuant to the Put. On or before 60 days after receipt of a Put Notice, the
Other Principals may exercise their right of first refusal to purchase all of
that Principal's and his or its Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and
associated Membership Points (or such portion as the Other Principals agree to
purchase) by providing written notice to the Principal and/or the Principal's
Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, and Balentine in the form of Exhibit
B (the "First Refusal Notice"), and, if that right is exercised, that Principal
or that Principal's Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, shall be
obligated to sell to the Other Principals, all of that Principal's and his or
its Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points (or
such portion as the Other Principals agree to purchase). If the Other Principals
do not elect to purchase all of that Principal's and his or its Permitted
Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points (or if Balentine has
not received any notice from the Other Principals of their intention to purchase
any portion of that Principal's or his or its Permitted Transferees' LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points within the 60-day period described in
this Section 7.2(d)), Balentine shall purchase any and all remaining LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points with respect to which the Put has
been exercised.

         The Purchase Closing Date for a purchase pursuant to this Section
7.2(d) shall be within 30 days following the earlier of the expiration of the
time period contained in the preceding paragraph or the delivery of the First
Refusal Notice by the Other Principals of their exercise in part or in whole of
their rights of first refusal. On the Purchase Closing Date, each of Balentine
and the Other Principals shall pay the Purchase Price, in proportion to the
amount of LLC Interests and associated Membership Points being purchased by that
Person, to the Member by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds against delivery of the LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points, free and clear of all liens, security interests and other encumbrances,
and any other documents or instruments of transfer as they may reasonably
request.

         e.    On the last day of the month in which a Put is exercised by a
Principal (on behalf of himself and/or his or its Permitted Transferees), that
Member shall cease to have any rights as a Member with respect to the LLC
Interests so Put other than (1) the right to receive the Purchase Price on the
Purchase Closing Date and (2) the right to receive distributions and allocations
with respect to those LLC Interests through the Purchase Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the LLC Interests to be purchased on
the Purchase Closing Date shall not have any voting rights during that period.

         Section 7.3. Call Options. The following provisions with respect to the
purchase and sale of an LLC Interest of a Principal and his or its Permitted
Transferees shall apply following the Principal's death, Disability, Retirement,
termination of a Principal's employment with the LLC, a transfer required by
operation of law or other involuntary transfer of an LLC Interest.

                                     -27-
<PAGE>
         a.    In the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of a
Principal, the Other Principals shall have the right (in proportion to their
Membership Points or in such other proportions as the Principals' Representative
may determine), exercisable by providing written notice, within 60 days of that
event, to the Principal, the Principal's estate and/or the Principal's Permitted
Transferees, as the case may be, and Balentine in the form of Exhibit C (a "Call
Notice"), to purchase (a "Call") from that Principal or that Principal's estate
and that Principal's Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, and, if that
right is exercised, that Principal or that Principal's estate and that
Principal's Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, shall be obligated to
sell to the Other Principals, all of that Principal's and his or its Permitted
Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points (or such portion as
the Other Principals agree to purchase). If the Other Principals do not elect to
purchase all of that Principal's and his or its Permitted Transferees' LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points, Balentine shall have the right,
exercisable by providing a Call Notice to the Principal, that Principal's estate
and that Principal's Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, within the
60-day period following receipt of notice from the Other Principals declining to
purchase all or a portion of that Principal's and his or its Permitted
Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points (or, if Balentine
has not received any notice from the Other Principals regarding their intent to
purchase any portion of that Principal's and his or its Permitted Transferee's
LLC Interests and associated Membership Points, within the 60-day period
following the first 60-day period), to purchase some or all of the remaining LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points of that Principal and his or its
Permitted Transferees. If that right is exercised, that Principal and that
Principal's estate and Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, shall be
obligated to sell to Balentine all of that Principal's and his or its Permitted
Transferee's remaining LLC Interests and associated Membership Points (or such
portion as Balentine agrees to purchase). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Other Principals and Balentine shall not be obligated to
purchase any or all of that Principal's and his or its Permitted Transferees'
LLC Interests and associated Membership Points, and any rights granted by this
Section 7.3(a) may be exercised in whole or in part. The aggregate purchase
price for all of that Principal's and his Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests
and associated Membership Points purchased pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall
be the Purchase Price thereof. Each of Balentine and the Other Principals shall
pay the Purchase Price in proportion to the amount of LLC Interests and
associated Membership Points being purchased by that Person.

         The Purchase Closing Date for a purchase pursuant to this Section
7.3(a) shall be within ten days following the earlier of the expiration of the
time periods contained in the preceding paragraph or the delivery of the Call
Notice by Balentine. At the closing of the purchase from the Principal, the
estate of the deceased Principal and/or the Principal's Permitted Transferees,
Balentine and/or the Other Principals shall deliver to the Principal, his or its
Permitted Transferees or the personal representative of the deceased Principal's
estate, as the case may be, the Purchase Price by certified check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds against delivery of the LLC Interests
and associated Membership Points, free and clear of all liens, security
interests and other encumbrances, and any other documents or instruments of
transfer as they may reasonably request. Balentine and the Other Principals may
purchase life insurance or

                                     -28-
<PAGE>
disability insurance on any Principal. Each Principal shall cooperate with
Balentine and the Other Principals in obtaining that insurance, including
taking any required physical examinations.

         b.    Within 60 days following (1) the date the Principal's employment
with the LLC is terminated other than by reason of death, Disability or
Retirement; (2) the date the Principal becomes a Non-Voting Member pursuant to
Section 4.6(d); or (3) a transfer required by operation of law or other
involuntary transfer of a Principal's or his or its Permitted Transferee's LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points, the Other Principals (in proportion
to their Membership Points or in such other proportions as the Principals'
Representative may determine) may exercise a Call with respect to all or any
portion of that Principal's and that Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points. If some or all of a Principal's or
his or its Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points
are transferred by operation of law or by means of any other involuntary
transfer, that Person shall cause its transferees to comply with all of the
requirements of this Section 7.3 as though they were parties hereto. A Call may
be exercised by the Other Principals providing a Call Notice to the Principal
and/or the Principal's Permitted Transferees and Balentine within 60 days after
that event, of their intent to purchase all or any portion of the Principal's
and that Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and associated
Membership Points. If the Other Principals do not exercise a Call with respect
to all of a Principal's and that Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points in accordance with the preceding
sentence (or if Balentine has not received any notice from the Other Principals
of their intent to purchase any portion of that Principal's and his or its
Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points within the
60-day period described in this Section 7.3(b)), Balentine shall have an
additional 60 days to exercise a Call with respect to that portion of the
Principal's and that Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC Interests and
associated Membership Points for which the Other Principals do not exercise a
Call by providing a Call Notice to the Principal and his or its Permitted
Transferees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Other Principals and Balentine shall not be obligated to exercise any Call, and
any right granted in this Section 7.3(b) may be exercised in whole or in part.

         If a Call is exercised as a result of (1) a Principal's employment with
the LLC being terminated without Cause or by reason of voluntary resignation of
his employment with the LLC; or (2) a transfer required by operation of law or
other involuntary transfer of a Principal's or that Principal's Permitted
Transferees' LLC Interests and associated Membership Points, the purchase price
payable by the Other Principals and/or Balentine to that Principal and his or
its Permitted Transferees for their LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points shall be the Purchase Price. If a Principal's employment with the LLC is
terminated by the LLC for Cause or if the Principal becomes a Non-Voting Member
pursuant to Section 4.6(d), then, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
herein, the Purchase Price payable by the Other Principals and/or Balentine to
that Principal and his or its Permitted Transferees for their LLC Interests
shall be 60% of the Purchase Price that would otherwise apply.

                                     -29-
<PAGE>
         The Purchase Closing Date under this Section 7.3(b) shall be within ten
days following the earlier of the expiration of the time periods contained in
the first paragraph of this Section 7.3(b) or the delivery of the Call Notice by
Balentine. At the closing of the purchase from the Principal, and/or the
Principal's Permitted Transferees, Balentine and/or the Other Principals shall
deliver to the Principal, or his or its Permitted Transferees, as the case may
be, the Purchase Price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds against delivery of the LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points, free and clear of all liens, security interests and other encumbrances,
and any other documents or instruments of transfer as they may reasonably
request.

         c.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Call is exercised with
respect to the LLC Interests and associated Membership Points of a Principal or
his or its Permitted Transferees who has voluntarily resigned his employment
with the LLC other than by death, Disability or Retirement or for Good Reason or
whose employment by the LLC is terminated for Cause or if the Principal becomes
a Non-Voting Member pursuant to Section 4.6(d), in each case at any time prior
to March 31, 2006, then the portion of the Purchase Price payable to that
Principal and his or its Permitted Transferees shall be paid by delivery of a
three-year promissory note of the purchaser(s) of such LLC Interests and
associated Membership Points to the selling Principal and his or its Permitted
Transferees, which shall bear interest at the "applicable federal rate"
determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code for three-year instruments (a
"Note"), payable quarterly, and the principal of which shall be payable three
years after the Purchase Closing Date. If such employment is terminated after
March 31, 2006, the Purchase Price must be paid in cash as provided above.

         d.    On the last day of the month in which a Call is exercised, the
Principal who has died, become Disabled or Retired and his or its Permitted
Transferees, or the Principal and his or its Permitted Transferees who have
received a Call Notice, shall cease to have any rights as a Member with respect
to the LLC Interest for which Calls have been exercised, other than (1) the
right to receive the Purchase Price on the Purchase Closing Date and (2) the
right to receive distributions and allocations with respect to that LLC Interest
through the Purchase Closing Date.

         e.    In the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of Robert,
the Family Trust shall be treated for purposes of this Section 7.3 as having
died, become Disabled or Retired on the date Robert died, became Disabled or
Retired. If Robert's employment with the LLC is terminated other than by reason
of death, Disability or Retirement, or if his Membership in the LLC is
terminated for Cause, then the Family Trust shall be treated for purposes of
this Section 7.3 as having terminated employment with the LLC or terminated its
membership in the LLC in such circumstance and on such date, except that, with
respect to only those LLC Interests owned by the Family Trust as of the date
hereof, each of the Family Trust shall, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in Section 7.3(b), receive 100% of the Purchase Price for those LLC
Interests and such amount shall be paid in cash.

         f.    If the Insurance Trust has not exercised all of its Put rights
pursuant to Section 7.2 by March 31, 2009, the Other Principals (in proportion
to their Membership Points or in such

                                     -30-
<PAGE>
other proportions as the Principals' Representative may determine) may exercise
a Call with respect to all or any portion of the Insurance Trust's LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points.  A Call may be exercised by the
Other Principals by providing a Call Notice to the Insurance Trust and
Balentine within 60 days after March 31, 2009 of their intent to purchase all
or any portion of the Insurance Trust's LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points. If the Other Principals do not exercise a Call with respect to all of
the Insurance Trust's LLC Interests and associated Membership Points in
accordance with the preceding sentence (or if Balentine has not received any
notice from the Other Principals of their intent to purchase any portion of the
Insurance Trust's LLC Interests and associated Membership Points within the
60-day period described in this Section 7.3(f)), Balentine shall have an
additional 60 days to exercise a Call with respect to that portion of the
Insurance Trust's LLC Interests and associated Membership Points for which the
Other Principals do not exercise a Call by providing a Call Notice to the
Insurance Trust. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Other Principals and Balentine shall not be obligated to exercise any Call, and
any right granted in this Section 7.3(f) may be exercised in whole or in part.

         The Purchase Closing Date under this Section 7.3(f) shall be within ten
days following the earlier of the expiration of the time periods contained in
the first paragraph of this Section 7.3(f) or the delivery of the Call Notice by
Balentine. At the closing of the purchase from the Principal, and/or the
Principal's Permitted Transferees, Balentine and/or the Other Principals shall
deliver to the Principal, or his or its Permitted Transferees, as the case may
be, the Purchase Price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds against delivery of the LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points, free and clear of all liens, security interests and other encumbrances,
and any other documents or instruments of transfer as they may reasonably
request.

         Section 7.4. Right of First Refusal.

         a.    If Balentine desires to sell any or all of Balentine's LLC
Interests to a third party (other than a Permitted Transferee) and Balentine
receives an offer from a third party that would permit Balentine to do so,
Balentine shall give notice ("Offer Notice") to the LLC and the Principals
within 15 days of receipt of such offer ("Offer"), which Offer Notice shall set
forth the name and address of the third party, the amount of the Membership
Points associated with the LLC Interests to be sold, the proposed purchase price
and the other terms and conditions of the Offer. The Principals shall have the
option, exercisable by notice to Balentine, within 60 days of the date of the
Offer Notice ("Election Period"), to purchase, pro rata in proportion to their
Membership Points, all (but not less than all) of the Balentine LLC Interests
and associated Membership Points subject to the Offer ("Offered Membership
Points") at the same price and on substantially the same terms specified in the
Offer except as provided in Section 7.4(c); provided, however, (i) that, if one
or more of the Principals does not elect to purchase his or its full
proportionate amount of the Offered Membership Points, then the balance may be
purchased by each of the other Principals ("Remaining Principals") in an amount
equal to the balance multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Membership Points then held by a Remaining Principal and the
denominator of which is the number of Membership Points

                                     -31-
<PAGE>
then held by all of the Remaining Principals, or in such other proportions as
they may agree, and (ii) that the Remaining Principals must exercise their
option to purchase all of the Offered Membership Points pro rata, or in such
other proportions as such Remaining Principals may agree, within ten days
("Final Election Period") after expiration of the Election Period.

         b.    If neither the Principals nor the Remaining Principals elect to
purchase all of the Offered Membership Points, Balentine may, notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Article 7, within 60 days after expiration of the
last applicable Election Period, transfer all (but not less than all) of the
Offered Membership Points to the third party upon the same terms and conditions
of the Offer (but, if the Offered Membership Points are not transferred within
that 60-day period, they shall again be subject to this Agreement and a new
right of first refusal); provided, however, that no such transfer may be made to
such third party unless the third party executes and delivers to the LLC a
written agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Board, agreeing to
be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, in which event the third party
shall become a Voting Member with the number of Membership Points associated
with the Offered Membership Points.

         c.    The closing of any purchase under this Section 7.4 shall be held
at a place and date specified by the purchaser(s) of the Offered Membership
Points ("Purchaser(s)"), but not more than 60 days after expiration of the last
applicable Election Period. At such closing, the Offered Membership Points shall
be delivered by Balentine to the Purchaser(s) thereof, free and clear of all
liens, security interests and other encumbrances, and the Purchaser(s) shall pay
the purchase price for the Offered Membership Points, and Balentine shall have
right to receive distributions and allocations with respect to those Offered
Membership Points through the Purchase Closing Date. If some or all of the
Principals are the Purchaser(s), the purchase price shall be payable in cash by
the Purchaser(s) even if some of the consideration provided in the Offer was in
a form other than cash, in which case such Purchaser(s) and Balentine shall in
good faith ascribe a value to such non-cash consideration. If such Purchaser(s)
and Balentine cannot agree on the value of the non-cash consideration, they
shall retain an independent appraiser, mutually acceptable to such Purchaser(s)
and Balentine, and the average of the high and low values ascribed to the
non-cash consideration by the appraiser shall be such value. The fees of such
appraiser shall be split equally between such Purchaser(s) (pro rata in
proportion to number of Membership Points held by each such Purchaser) and
Balentine.

         d.    If all of Balentine's LLC Interests and associated Membership
Points are purchased by a third party, then such third party shall succeed to
all of Balentine's rights and obligations under this Agreement, including the
obligations of Balentine under Section 7.5. If Balentine transfers part of its
LLC Interests and associated Membership Points to such third party pursuant to
this Section 7.4, the Principals, Balentine and such third party shall make
appropriate adjustments to the terms of this Agreement to entitle such third
party to exercise Balentine's rights under Sections 7.2 and 7.3 proportionately
with Balentine, and to otherwise grant such third party rights similar to
Balentine's other rights under this Agreement.

         Section 7.5. Change of Control.

         a.    In the event of a Change of Control of WTC or the LLC, each of
the Principals or their Permitted Transferees shall have the right, which must
be exercised within six months after such Change of Control, to put to Balentine
all or a portion of the LLC Interests and associated Membership Points held by
such Principal and/or Permitted Transferee. Upon exercise of a put under this
Section 7.5, Balentine shall thereupon become obligated to purchase the LLC
Interests and associated Membership Points with respect to which the put has
been exercised. The Purchase Closing Date under this Section 7.5(a) shall be
within 60 days following the delivery of the notice by a Principal and his or
its Permitted Transferees, and such Persons shall have the right to receive
distributions and allocations on the LLC Interests to be purchased through the
Purchase Closing Date. At the Purchase Closing Date, Balentine shall deliver to
the Principal, or his or its Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, the
Purchase Price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds against delivery of the LLC Interests and associated Membership Points,
free and clear of all liens, security interests and other encumbrances, and any
other documents or instruments of transfer as Balentine may reasonably request.

         b.    In the event of a Change of Control of WTC prior to March 31,
2006, if the Principals do not elect to receive the accelerated payments
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) of the Merger Agreement and less than all of the
Principals and their Permitted Transferees exercise the put right provided for
in Section 7.5(a), the Principals who or that have not exercised their put
pursuant to Section 7.5(a) shall have the right to purchase all, but not less
than all, outstanding LLC Interests then held by Balentine, WTI, WTC and their
Permitted Transferees from such Persons, including those put under Section
7.5(a). This right to purchase may be exercised by some or all of such
Principals by providing written notice to WTC or its successor within eight
months after the Change of Control of their intent to purchase all, but not less
than all, outstanding LLC Interests from Balentine, WTI, WTC and their Permitted
Transferees. The Purchase Closing Date under this Section 7.5(b) shall be within
30 days following the delivery of the notice by such Principals. At the Purchase
Closing Date, such Principals shall deliver to Balentine, WTI, WTC or their
Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, the WTC Change of Control Purchase
Price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds against
delivery of the LLC Interests, free and clear of all liens, security interests
and other encumbrances, and any other documents or instruments of transfer as
they may reasonably request. Balentine shall have the right to receive
distributions and allocations with respect to those LLC Interests through the
Purchase Closing Date.

         Section 7.6. Substitute Members. Any Transfer of LLC Interests other
than pursuant to this Article 7 shall nevertheless not entitle the transferee,
unless already a Member, to become a Member or be entitled to exercise or
receive any right, power or benefit of a Member other than the right to share in
profits and losses, receive distributions and allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit or similar item to which the transferor Member would
otherwise be entitled, to the extent assigned, unless the transferor Member
designates, in a written instrument delivered to the Board, its transferee to
become a substitute Member and the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion,
consents to the admission of that transferee as a Non-Voting Member. That
transferee

                                     -33-
<PAGE>
shall not become a substitute Member without having first executed an
instrument satisfactory to the Board accepting and agreeing to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement, and without having paid to the LLC a fee sufficient to cover all
reasonable expenses of the LLC in connection with that transferee's admission
as a substitute Member.

         Section 7.7. Recognition of Transfer by LLC. No Transfer of a Member's
LLC Interest or any part thereof in violation of this Article 7 shall be valid
or effective, and neither the LLC nor the Members shall recognize the same for
the purpose of making distributions pursuant to this Article 7 with respect to
that transferred LLC Interest or part thereof. Neither the LLC, any member of
the Board nor any Member shall incur any liability as a result of refusing to
make any distributions to the transferee of any such invalid Transfer. Upon the
valid transfer of a Member's LLC Interest, that Person shall cease to be a
Member, and the LLC's books and records, including Schedule 1, shall be revised
to reflect that event.

         Section 7.8. Order of Puts and Calls and Right of First Refusal. With
respect to Sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, the first to occur of (1) the delivery of
a Put Notice under Section 7.2(d); (2) the delivery of the first Call Notice
under Section 7.3(a) or (b); or (3) the delivery of an Offer Notice under
Section 7.4, shall govern the rights and obligations of the parties with respect
to the LLC Interests subject to the Put Notice, the Call Notice, the Purchase
Notice or the Offer Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a put
notice under Section 7.5(a) or a call notice under Section 7.5(b) shall govern
the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the LLC Interests.

         Section 7.9. Indemnification. In the case of a Transfer or attempted
Transfer of an LLC Interest that has not received the consents required by this
Article 7, the parties engaging or attempting to engage in that Transfer shall
be liable to indemnify and hold the LLC and the other Members harmless from all
costs, liabilities and damages any such indemnified Person may incur (including,
without limitation, incremental tax liability and attorneys' fees and expenses)
as a result of that Transfer or attempted Transfer and efforts to enforce the
indemnity granted hereby.

         Section 7.10. Issuance of Additional LLC Interests.

         a.    Subject to Sections 5.13(d), 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, the Board may
admit new Members to the LLC, issue additional LLC Interests and grant options
to purchase LLC Interests upon terms and conditions it may establish from time
to time, which terms may include any Capital Deduction Amount relating to the
LLC Interests and, the rights, if any, that a holder of such LLC Interests will
have relating to the matters discussed in this Article 7. As a condition to the
admission of a new Member, that Member must become a party to this Agreement.

         b.    Upon the issuance of additional LLC Interests with associated
Membership Points to a Member, an Officer shall make the appropriate revisions
to Schedule 1.

         Section 7.11. Assignment of Balentine's Rights and Obligations.
Balentine may assign any or all of its rights and delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Article 7 to one or more of its Affiliates.

         Section 7.12. Guarantee of Performance. WTC hereby guarantees due and
punctual payment and performance when due of all obligations of Balentine (and
any assignee or delegate under Section 7.11) under this Agreement (as such may
be amended or modified subsequent to the date hereof). This guaranty shall be an
absolute obligation of WTC for its own account and a guaranty of payment, and
not of collection.

LLC, and a statement of such Member's Capital Account balance, as of the end of
that quarter;

         c.    To each Member, as soon as available from the LLC's accountants,

         e.    To Balentine, within five business days after the end of each
quarter, an estimate of the net income of the LLC for the year-to-date period
through the end of that quarter.

         Section 8.2. Accounting Method. The LLC's books and records shall be
kept on an accrual basis for financial reporting and tax purposes. All records
shall be maintained in accordance with

                                     -35-
<PAGE>
GAAP and shall reflect all LLC transactions and be appropriate and adequate for
the LLC's business.

         Section 8.3. LLC's Independent Accounting Firm. The LLC's independent
accounting firm shall be selected by the Principals and shall be acceptable to
WTI, which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                                  TAX MATTERS

         Section 9.1. Tax Matters Member.

         a.    The LLC's initial "tax matters partner" designated under Code
Section 6231(a)(7) and Section 301.6231(a)(7)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (the
"Tax Matters Member") shall be the LLC's Chief Executive Officer, who shall be a
Member at all times he or she is serving as the Tax Matters Member. Each Member,
by executing this Agreement, consents to such designation of the Tax Matters
Member and agrees to execute, certify, acknowledge, deliver, swear to, file and
record at the appropriate public offices all documents necessary or appropriate
to evidence such consent.

         b.    The Tax Matters Member shall have the power to manage and
control, on the LLC's behalf, any administrative proceeding at the LLC level
with the Internal Revenue Service relating to the determination of any item of
LLC income, gain, loss, deduction or credit for federal income tax purposes. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Tax Matters Member shall have all the powers
and responsibilities of such position provided in the Code and (1) shall
promptly furnish the Internal Revenue Service with information sufficient to
cause each Member to be treated as a "notice partner" as defined in Code Section
6231(a)(8), (2) shall, within ten days of the receipt of any notice from the
Internal Revenue Service in any administrative proceeding at the LLC level
relating to the determination of any LLC item of income, gain, loss or
deduction, mail a copy of that notice to each Member and (3) shall not file any
action or suit, extend any statute of limitations or settle any action or suit
relating to the LLC's tax matters without first notifying each Member.
Reasonable expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Member, in his capacity as such,
will be treated as LLC expenses hereunder and will be deducted in computing the
Run Rate.

         c.    The Board may at any time hereafter designate from among the
Members a new Tax Matters Member.

         Section 9.2. Right to Make Tax Elections; Tax Classification.

         a.    Subject to Section 5.13(d), the Board may, in its discretion,

permitted under the Code, including

                                     -36-
<PAGE>
an election in accordance with Code Section 754. Upon request of the Board,
each Member shall supply the information necessary to give effect to such an
election.

         b.    Each Member intends that the LLC be classified for federal tax
purposes as a partnership that is not a "publicly traded partnership" treated as
a corporation under Code Section 7704(a), and each Member shall at all times use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the LLC's classification as such.
The LLC shall not elect to be classified as other than a partnership for federal
tax purposes.

         a.    Except as otherwise provided herein, any document referred to or
incorporated herein or by the Delaware Act, the debts, obligations and
liabilities of the LLC, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be
solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the LLC, and no Member shall be
obligated personally for any debt, obligation or liability of the LLC solely
because he or she is a Member.

         b.    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any document
referred to or incorporated herein or by the Delaware Act, a Member, in his
capacity as such, shall have no liability in excess of (1) the amount of that
Member's capital contributions, (2) that Member's share of any assets and
undistributed Profits of the LLC and (3) the amount of any distributions
wrongfully distributed to that Member.

         Section 10.2. Exculpation.

         a.    No Officer or Manager shall be liable to the LLC or any Member
for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission
performed or omitted by that Officer or Manager in good faith on the LLC's
behalf and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the LLC
and within the scope of authority conferred on that Officer or Manager hereby,
except that an Officer or Manager shall be liable for any such loss, damage or
claim incurred by reason of that Officer's or Manager's bad faith, gross
negligence, reckless disregard of his duties hereunder, willful misconduct or
breach of the provisions hereof or in connection with any transaction for which
such Officer or Manager or any Affiliate thereof received an improper personal
benefit.

         b.    An Officer or Manager shall be protected fully in relying in good
faith upon the LLC's records and upon information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the LLC by any person as to matters the Officer or
Manager reasonably believes are within that person's professional or expert
competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the
LLC, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and

                                     -37-
<PAGE>
amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses or net cash flow or any
other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which
distributions to Members might properly be paid.

         Section 10.3. Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the LLC shall indemnify each Officer and Manager for any loss,
damage or claim incurred by that Officer or Manager by reason of any act or
omission that Officer or Manager performed or omitted in good faith on behalf of
the LLC and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the
LLC and within the scope of authority conferred on that Officer or Manager or
hereby, except that no Officer or Manager shall be entitled to be indemnified in
respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by that Officer or Manager by
reason of bad faith, gross negligence, reckless disregard of his duties
hereunder, willful misconduct or breach of the provisions hereof with respect to
those acts or omissions or in connection with any transaction for which such
Officer or Manager or any Affiliate thereof received an improper personal
benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) any indemnity under this Section
10.3 shall be provided out of and to the extent of LLC assets only, and no
Member shall have any personal liability on account thereof; and (b) nothing
contained herein shall limit any indemnification or other rights of the LLC or
any Member under the Merger Agreement or any document referred to or
incorporated therein.

         Section 10.4. Expenses. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, the LLC shall advance to an Officer or Manager any expenses, including
legal fees, that Officer or Manager incurs in defending any claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding (that advance to be made prior to the final
disposition of that claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding), including,
without limitation, claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings with respect
to which that Officer or Manager is alleged to have not met the applicable
standard of conduct or is alleged to have acted or failed to act in a manner
which, if those allegations were true, would not entitle that Officer or Manager
to indemnification hereunder, upon receipt by the LLC of an undertaking by or on
behalf of that Officer or Manager to repay that amount if it is determined that
that Officer or Manager is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in
Section 10.3.

                        NON-COMPETITION; CONFIDENTIALITY

         Section 11.1. Confidential Information.

         a.    Each Member acknowledges and agrees that (1) the investment
advisory and investment management business is an intensely competitive
business, (2) as a result of his or its association with the Balentine Entities,
he or it has had access to, and is and will be in possession of, Confidential
Information, all is which is of vital importance to the success of the Balentine
Entities, WTI and WTI's Affiliates, and (3) the use by such Member for his or
its own account or the disclosure by Member to any existing or potential
competitor of a Balentine Entity, WTI or WTI's Affiliates of Confidential
Information would place the Balentine Entities, WTI, or WTI's

                                     -38-
<PAGE>
Affiliates at a serious competitive disadvantage and cause irreparable harm to
the business of the Balentine Entities, WTI or WTI's Affiliates.

         b.    Each Member acknowledges and agrees that "Confidential
Information" includes, without limitation:

               (1)  trade secrets relating to the business practices of the
Balentine Entities, WTI or WTI's Affiliates and other information pertaining to
the goodwill of the Balentine Entities, WTI or WTI's Affiliates and Clients and
WTI Clients;

               (2)  "non-public personal information," as that phrase is defined
in Section 509 of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and federal Regulation P
promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board, of natural person Clients
or WTI Clients, except that, for purposes of this Agreement, such term shall
extend to all such clients, present and former. "Non-public personal
information" means (i) personally identifiable client financial information,
including, but not limited to, information provided to, or obtained by, the
Balentine Entities or WTI or its Affiliates confidentially or on a non-public
basis, and (ii) any list, description, or other grouping of clients (and
publicly available information pertaining to them) that is derived using any
personally identifiable financial information that is not publicly available;

               (3)  proprietary financial products of the Balentine Entities,
WTI or WTI's Affiliates, embodying the unique trade know-how and operational
methods of the Balentine Entities, WTI or WTI's Affiliates, and, without
limitation, all trade know-how, secrets, operational methods, pricing,
investment policies, procedures, personnel, concepts, format, style, techniques,
proprietary software, business strategies, client investment strategies and
other financial information, and other business affairs of the Balentine
Entities, WTI or WTI's Affiliates that are unique to the Balentine Entities, WTI
or WTI's Affiliates and are made known to or learned by such Member heretofore
or hereafter; and

               (4)  lists of WTI Clients.

         c.    Each Member acknowledges and agrees that (1) Confidential
Information is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the
appropriate Balentine Entity or WTI or its Affiliates, as the case may be, and
such Member does not have and shall not have any right, title or interest
therein by virtue of his or her status as an executive of the LLC or a Member,
and (2) Confidential Information is not readily accessible to competitors of the
Balentine Entities or WTI or its Affiliates, as the case may be.

         d.    By reason of Sections 11.1(a), (b) and (c) above, each Member
covenants that he or it shall not directly or indirectly, reveal, divulge or
make known to any Person other than the Balentine Entities, WTI, or WTI's
Affiliates or use for his own account, or for the account of any Person other
than the Balentine Entities, WTI, or WTI's Affiliates, (1) until such Member
ceases to be a Member and for a period of five years thereafter, any
Confidential Information relating to WTI or its Affiliates or WTI Clients; (2)
until such Member ceases to be a Member and

                                     -39-
<PAGE>
thereafter, any Confidential Information not permitted to be revealed,
divulged, or made known under the LLC's, WTI's, its Affiliates' or the
Balentine Entities' policies to comply with all applicable U.S. federal and
state privacy laws in effect, including, without limitation, Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and any and all
applicable regulations implementing either Act or successor Act; and (3) until
such Member ceases to be a Member and for a period of five years thereafter,
any Confidential Information not included in clauses (1) and (2) of this
subsection.

         e.    Each Principal (1) shall comply, until such Member ceases to be a
Member, with all reasonable procedures each Balentine Entity, WTI or one of its
Affiliates may adopt from time to time to preserve the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information; (2) acknowledges that the absence of any legend
indicating the confidentiality of any materials will not give rise to an
inference that the contents thereof or information derived therefrom are not
confidential; and (3) shall immediately following the termination of such
Principal's employment with or membership in the LLC return to each Balentine
Entity, WTI or such WTI Affiliate, as the case may be, all materials that
Balentine Entity or WTI or any of WTI's Affiliates provides such Principal
during the Term, all works created by such Principal or others in the course of
his, her, or their employment duties during the Term and all copies thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations imposed on such Principal
pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall not apply to such Principal's (y) compliance
with legal process or subpoena, or (z) statements in response to inquiry from a
court or regulatory body; provided that, to the extent permitted by law, such
Principal gives the appropriate Balentine Entities, WTI or its Affiliates
reasonable prior written notice of that process, subpoena or request and uses
reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential
Information.

         Section 11.2. Non-Competition. With respect to a natural person
Principal, until the termination of a Principal's employment with the LLC and
each of its Subsidiaries (the "Restricted Period"), such Principal shall not,
for whatever reason, whether for his or her account or for the account of any
other Person, without the prior written consent of the LLC, as a shareholder,
employee, partner, member, board member, consultant, independent contractor,
representative or otherwise, engage in any business competitive with any
business conducted by the Balentine Entities or the Existing Funds at any time
during the Restricted Period, in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas of Atlanta,
Georgia, or Nashville, Tennessee (the "Restricted Area"); provided, however,
that Robert's Restricted Period shall extend until one year after the
termination of his employment with the LLC and each of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit such Principal from
being engaged in a competitive business during the Restricted Period if such
Principal is not providing to such competing business services comparable to
services provided to the LLC or from being a shareholder or equity holder in any
publicly-traded entity whose business is competitive with, the business
heretofore conducted, or conducted at any time during the Restricted Period and
in the Restricted Area, by the Balentine Entities or the Existing Funds, as long
as such Principal does not hold more than a three percent equity interest in
that publicly-traded entity, provided that an investment in WTC shall not come
within this limitation. Each Principal acknowledges that the Restricted Period
and the Restricted Area in this paragraph are appropriate given the unique
nature of the services he or she has provided and

                                     -40-
<PAGE>
will provide the Balentine Entities, and further acknowledges that his or her
fulfillment of the Restricted Period and Restricted Area in this Section 11.2
will not cause him or her substantial economic hardship and will not render him
or her unemployable within the investment management industry. The restrictions
set forth in this Section 11.2 shall not apply if Robert's employment with the
LLC and each of its Subsidiaries is terminated by the LLC and such Subsidiaries
without Cause or by Robert for Good Reason.

         Section 11.3. Non-Solicitation. Until one year after the date of
termination of each Principal's employment with the LLC and each of its
Subsidiaries, such Principal shall not, directly or indirectly, for whatever
reason, whether for his own account or the account of any Person, without the
prior written consent of the LLC:

         a.    solicit, either directly or indirectly, or otherwise induce or
attempt to induce any WTI Client whose residence or principal office is located
in Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Florida,
Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Nevada or California, or any Client
whose residence or principal business office is located in Georgia, Tennessee,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama or Florida to place any funds or
securities under management with any Person other than WTC, its Affiliates, the
Balentine Entities or the Existing Funds and will otherwise treat the list of
Clients as if it were Confidential Information; provided, however, that the
prohibition of this covenant shall apply only to such clients with whom the
Principal had Material Contact on the LLC's or one of its Subsidiaries' behalf
during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the termination of his
employment. For purposes of this Agreement, a Principal has "Material Contact"
with such client if (1) he had business dealings with such client on the LLC's
or one of its Subsidiaries' behalf, (2) he was responsible for supervising or
coordinating the dealings between the LLC (or one of its Subsidiaries) and such
client, or (3) he obtained Confidential Information about such client as a
result of his association with the LLC or one of its Subsidiaries; or

         b.    solicit or hire any Person who is, or was during the 12 months
prior to the time of such Principal's termination of employment, employed by or
associated with a Balentine Entity, WTI or a WTI Affiliate as an executive,
officer, employee, manager, salesman, consultant, independent contractor,
representative or other agent or induce such Person to terminate his or her
employment relationship with any Balentine Entity or to enter into employment
with any other Person.

         The restrictions set forth in this Section 11.3 shall not apply if a
Principal's employment with the LLC and each of its Subsidiaries is terminated
by the LLC and such Subsidiaries without Cause or by such Member for Good
Reason.

         Nothing in Section 11.3(a) or (b) shall permit a Principal to use
Confidential Information made available by WTI or any of its Affiliates to the
Balentine Entities (including, without limitation, WTI Client lists) for any
purpose other than the pursuit of the Balentine Entities' business objectives or
those of WTI or its Affiliates.

         Section 11.4. Use of Performance Information. Each Principal covenants
that he or it will not, at any time after the date hereof, for whatever reason,
whether for his or its account or for the account of any other Person (other
than a Balentine Entity), publish any investment results or performance
information of a Balentine Entity or an Existing Fund (including, without
limitation, the investment performance of any accounts or groups of accounts for
which such Principal was a portfolio manager), in connection with any business
similar to, related to or in competition with the business conducted by a
Balentine Entity, unless such Principal refrains from taking any credit,
explicitly or implicitly, for the achievement of those results or performance.

         Section 11.5. Specific Performance.

         a.    The Members acknowledge that it is fair and reasonable that they
make the covenants and undertakings set forth above, and have done so with the
benefit of the advice of counsel. In addition, the Members acknowledge that any
breach or attempted breach by any of them of the provisions of this Article 11
will cause irreparable harm to WTI, its Affiliates and each Balentine Entity,
for which monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, WTI, its
Affiliates and each Balentine Entity shall be entitled to apply for and obtain
injunctive relief (temporary, preliminary and permanent) to restrain the breach
or threatened breach of, or otherwise to specifically enforce, any provision of
this Article 11, without the requirement to post a bond or provide other
security. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation or waiver of any
other right or remedy that may be available to the WTI, its Affiliates or a
Balentine Entity for that breach or threatened breach. For emergency relief
(including temporary and preliminary injunctive relief), an application may be
made in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Members further agree that the
subject matter and duration of the restrictions covered herein are reasonable in
light of the facts as they exist today. If any restriction contained in this
Article 11 is deemed unreasonable by a court, it shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, be reduced to the maximum restriction that is enforceable
under such law.

         b.    The restrictions set forth in Section 11.1 shall apply to
Permitted Transferees who own LLC Interests.

         c.    If Principals exercise their purchase rights under
Section 7.5(b), then WTC and its Affiliates shall only be entitled to enforce
their rights under Article 11 with respect to Confidential Information relating
to WTC, one of its Affiliates (other than the LLC and its Subsidiaries) and WTI
Clients, and with respect to non-solicitation of WTI Clients and employees of
WTI or one of its Affiliates (other than the LLC and its Subsidiaries).

                                CERTAIN COVENANTS

         Section 12.1. Compliance with Laws; Maintenance.

         a.    The LLC and the Subsidiaries shall and the Board shall cause the
LLC to comply in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable
to the LLC and the Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, all federal and
state laws and regulations relating to investment advisers and all laws and
regulations applicable to the LLC and the Subsidiaries as an Affiliate of a
bank, a thrift or a bank or thrift holding company.

         b.    The LLC and the Subsidiaries shall maintain in full force and
effect its limited liability company or other existence, rights and franchises
and all other rights, licenses and registrations owned or possessed by them.

         Section 12.2. Business Agreements.

         a.    Each Principal covenants that, from and after the date hereof,
the Existing Funds and all other private investment funds, if any, for which the
LLC or any Subsidiary serves as a general partner or managing member shall not
at any time own or otherwise control in the aggregate more than 5% of any class
of voting securities of any Person; provided that WTC agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the LLC or any Subsidiary in reallocating any
shares in order to reduce or maintain its ownership or control under such
percentage.

         b.    (1) Subject to Section 5.13(d), to WTC's fiduciary and other
professional duties and to the requirements of law, WTC will refer to the LLC
and its Subsidiaries all New Business Opportunities that are derived from or
referred to WTC and its Affiliates (other than Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC and
Roxbury Capital Management, LLC) from within the States of Alabama, Georgia,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. As provided in
Section 5.13(d)(14), the Board shall unanimously agree on which New Business
Opportunities the LLC should pursue and on a budget and business plan for the
implementation of any such New Business Opportunity. If all of the Managers
designated by the Principals vote to approve the New Business Opportunity
pursuant to Section 5.13(d)(14) but some or all of the Managers designated by
Balentine, WTC or their Affiliates do not, WTC and its Affiliates (other than
Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC and Roxbury Capital Management, LLC) will be
prohibited from pursuing the New Business Opportunity without again referring it
to the LLC and its Subsidiaries. If some or all of the Managers designated by
the Principals do not vote to approve the New Business Opportunity pursuant to
Section 5.13(d)(14), WTC and its Affiliates (other than Cramer Rosenthal
McGlynn, LLC and Roxbury Capital Management, LLC) will be permitted to pursue
the New Business Opportunity without again referring it to the LLC and its
Subsidiaries.

                                     -43-
<PAGE>
               (2) Each Member agrees that, from time to time as the LLC incurs
expenses relating to a New Business Opportunity, such Member shall, within 15
days of a written notice by the LLC (which notice will contain reasonable detail
of the net expenses of such New Business Opportunity), make an additional
capital contribution to the LLC in immediately available funds in an amount, in
the proportion that such Member's Membership Points bear to the total
outstanding Membership Points, of the net expenses set forth in such notice. For
these purposes, "net expenses" shall be all expenses less all revenue derived by
such New Business Opportunity. To the extent the LLC has Free Cash Flow on the
due date for any such additional capital contributions, the amount of the net
expenses set forth in such notice shall be paid out of such Free Cash Flow
instead of by the Members' making such contributions, and they shall be promptly
notified thereof.

               (3) WTC will also, at all times consistent with its fiduciary and
other professional duties and subject to the requirements of law in appropriate
circumstances, work cooperatively with the LLC to make available the LLC's
services to a prospective client of WTC or one of its Affiliates whose residence
or principal business office is located in the States of Alabama, Georgia,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina or Tennessee and whose needs include
services the LLC provides, unless such prospective client makes an unsolicited
request not to be referred to the LLC.

               (4) WTC will use its reasonable best efforts to cause Wilmington
Trust FSB to open a trust and/or banking office in Atlanta and to place the
office in the same space as is presently used by the LLC if commercially
feasible. If such office is in the space presently used by the LLC, Wilmington
Trust FSB will be responsible for its pro rata share of rent and related
expenses based on the percent of square footage occupied by Wilmington Trust
FSB. WTC will cause the Chief Executive Officer of the LLC to be appointed an
officer of Wilmington Trust FSB and cause the other Wilmington Trust FSB staff
in such office to report to such officer. The Wilmington Trust FSB officers and
employees and the LLC's officers and employees will use reasonable best efforts
to coordinate marketing and client development programs and services.

               (5) WTC will make available on a nationwide basis in the United
States the LLC's Subsidiaries' expertise in their manager of managers program,
including in connection therewith asset allocation modeling, asset rebalancing
strategies and manager evaluation and selection. WTC may access this expertise
through client investment in the LLC's Subsidiaries' investment funds,
proprietary WTC investment funds managed by those Subsidiaries, client
customized investment funds managed by those Subsidiaries and/or
non-discretionary advisory services of those Subsidiaries. Accordingly, WTC will
work cooperatively with those Subsidiaries to use their know how and the
services of their officers and employees to provide advice and assistance
relating to the manager of managers program and will pay to the appropriate
Subsidiary a fee for such services and know how as may be agreed by WTC and the
LLC from time to time. The Principals agree to cause those Subsidiaries to use
their reasonable best efforts to meet the reasonable needs of WTC in connection
with the use of the expertise and a condition of WTC's continued use of the
Subsidiaries will depend on those Subsidiaries' meeting commercially reasonable
service levels and performance standards. It is intended that

                                     -44-
<PAGE>
the service levels and performance standards will be discussed by WTC and the
LLC from time to time and will be adjusted from time to time on a mutual basis.

               (6) WTC will provide to the LLC's Subsidiaries client related
services that are available for the use of WTC's other asset management
affiliates, including external asset management, custom-built insurance
products, and marketing materials on a reasonable and fair basis and cost. WTC
will also make available the full array of support services on the same basis as
are made available to its other affiliated asset managers, including internal
asset management, human resources, marketing, financial reporting, tax and
estate planning, compliance and information technology, as the LLC may request
from time to time.

               (7) The LLC shall have the right to elect, on or prior to six
months after the Closing Date, to have the officers and employees of the LLC and
its Subsidiaries participate in some or all WTC's then-existing employee benefit
plans (other than the Wilmington Trust profit sharing plan or bonus or incentive
plans) at the LLC's cost; provided, however, that (i) once the election to
participate or not participate in a particular plan is made it cannot be changed
without WTC's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii)
such officers and employees are otherwise eligible to participate in such plans
in accordance with their terms, (iii) nothing herein shall entitle such an
officer or employee to participate in a plan where participation is not based
solely on eligibility criteria set forth in the plan and (iv) WTC acknowledges
that there will be no cost to the LLC for WTC stock options granted to officers
and employees of the LLC or its Subsidiaries. With respect to the WTC employee
benefit plans, for all purposes, except for the computation of the benefits
under defined benefit plans, WTC agrees that years of service with any Balentine
Entities shall be deemed to be years of service with WTC. The LLC shall have a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any new employee benefit plans made
available to WTC's employees generally.

         Section 13.2. Events Causing Dissolution. The LLC shall be dissolved
and its affairs shall be wound up upon the occurrence of any of the following

         Section 13.3. Notice of Dissolution. Upon the LLC's dissolution, the
person or persons appointed to carry out the winding up of the LLC (the
"Liquidating Trustee") shall promptly notify the Members of that dissolution.

         Section 13.4. Liquidation. Upon dissolution of the LLC:

         a.    The proceeds of liquidation shall be distributed, as realized, in
the following order and priority:

               (1)  First, to the LLC's creditors, including Members who are
         creditors and the Liquidating Trustee, to the extent otherwise
         permitted by law, in satisfaction of the LLC's liabilities (whether by
         payment or making reasonable provision for payment thereof), other than
         liabilities for distributions to Members;

               (2)  Next, to Balentine up to the Base Valuation, which amount
         shall be subtracted from its Capital Account balance;

               (3)  Next, to all Members, up to the amount of their Capital
         Account balances, in proportion thereto; and

               (4)  The remainder, to all Members in proportion to their
         respective Membership Points.

         b.    If the Liquidating Trustee determines that it is not feasible to
liquidate all of the LLC's assets, then the Liquidating Trustee (1) shall cause
the Fair Market Value of the assets not so liquidated to be determined and (2)
shall distribute such assets in kind to the Members pursuant to Section 13.4(a).
For purposes of such section, a distribution of any such asset in kind to a
Member shall be considered a distribution of an amount equal to such asset's
Fair Market Value as of the date of distribution thereof. Each such asset shall
be treated as if it was sold for such Fair Market Value, and the resulting
Profits or Losses shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with
Article 6.

         Section 13.5. Termination. The LLC shall terminate when all of its
assets, after payment of or provision for all of its debts, liabilities and
obligations, have been distributed to the Members as provided for in this
Article 13, and the Certificate has been canceled in the manner required by the
Delaware Act.

         Section 13.6. Claims of the Members. For purposes of this Article 13,
the Members shall look solely to the LLC's assets for the return of their
capital contributions. If the assets of the LLC remaining after payment of or
provision for all of the LLC's debts, liabilities and obligations are
insufficient to return those capital contributions, the Members shall have no
recourse against the LLC or any other Member.

Executive Officer as the true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact of
that Member, in his or its name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign and

certificates that may from time to time be required by the laws of the United
States of America, the State of Delaware, any other state or country or any

explicitly provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a continuing
waiver of the provision being waived. No such waiver in any instance shall
constitute a waiver in any other instance or for any other purpose or impair the
right of the party against whom that waiver is claimed in all other instances or
for all other purposes to require full compliance.

         Section 15.5. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and, to the extent permitted by this
Agreement, their heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

         Section 15.6. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
particular nonmaterial provision hereof shall not affect the other provisions
hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed in all respects by interpreting
that invalid or unenforceable provision as nearly to the original meaning as
possible so as to make it valid and enforceable or, if that is not possible or
permitted by applicable law, by omitting that invalid or unenforceable
provision. To the extent any material provision hereof is determined by a court
or regulatory body to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall use their
good faith efforts to address the implications of that invalidity or
unenforceability to preserve the essential understanding of the parties with
respect hereto.

         Section 15.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         Section 15.8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under
and governed by Delaware law, without giving effect to the choice or conflicts
of law provisions thereof. Each of WTC, WTI and Balentine hereby agrees to
submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Georgia and the courts
of the United States of America located in the Northern District in the State of
Georgia in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this

otherwise requires, and the use of any gender shall include all genders.

to this Agreement shall be entitled to any rights or benefits hereunder;
provided, however, that WTI's Affiliates, each Balentine Entity and each
Subsidiary is a third-party beneficiary of Sections 11.1, 11.3 and 11.5.

         Section 15.12. Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies provided
herein are cumulative, and the use of any one right or remedy by any party shall
not preclude or waive its right to use any and all other remedies.

         Section 15.13. Integration. This Agreement (as it may be amended from
time to time) and the exhibits and schedules hereto constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, express or
implied, with respect thereto.
