not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the Agreement.

      strict confidence in accordance with the terms of such section. You may
      disclose such rates to your wholly owned subsidiaries and/or network
      affiliates for purposes of extending the rates and terms of this Addendum
      to such entities as permitted under this Section.

      on the cover page of the Agreement is hereby changed to 20 Kbytes per Ad.

      Agreement set forth in the initial three pages of the Agreement is hereby
      replaced in its entirety with the following

      |*|

      a manner that conforms to then current industry standards with regard to
      ad serving of new ad units|*|For the purpose of the written request set
      forth above, electronic mail (E-Mail) to Your Dedicated Technical Account
      Manager or DoubleClick's General Counsel with follow-up verbal
      confirmation that such request was indeed received by either of those
      parties, shall be deemed sufficient as a written request.

      RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

      For the initial 18 months of the extended Term, You hereby grant
      DoubleClick a "right of first refusal' to perform ad management and
      delivery services with respect to Your e-mail newsletters/promotions and
      sweepstakes promotions. For the initial 18 months of the extended Term,
      DoubleClick hereby grants You a "right of first refusal" to provide search
      solutions for the DoubleClick Web site, customer service site or DART
      interface. A "right of first refusal" shall mean the following: (i) the
      party who desires services ("Customer") shall approach the other party
      ("Vendor") concerning the services for which the Vendor has a right of
      first refusal; (ii) for the next thirty day period, the parties shall work
      in good faith to come to negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement
      whereby Vendor would provide such services to Customer; and (iii) if the
      parties do not execute such a definitive agreement in such thirty day
      period, then the Customer may approach and contract with third parties for
      the relevant services. Nothing in this Section shall require the parties
      to enter into a definitive agreement concerning the relevant services if
      the parties in good faith cannot agree upon terms, conditions, and
      pricing.

      ONE-TO-ONE SUPPORT

      DoubleClick shall provide You with one-to-one support free of charge
      throughout the duration of the extended term which shall consist of the
      following: You shall be provided a dedicated Technical Account Manager at
      DoubleClick ("Your Dedicated Technical Account Manager"), who shall (i)
      serve as Your interface to DoubleClick support, and (ii) work with You to
      better understand Your business needs and site configuration and use this
      in-depth knowledge, together with his/her technical expertise, to help
      resolve any problems with Your use of the Service that You may encounter,
      and find ways to proactively improve Your use of DoubleClick's DART

      (which shall include, by way of example, and not limitation, telephone
      support, on-site visits, and periodic conference calls). In the event that
      issues arise regarding the level, quality, frequency and effectiveness of
      the support You are receiving from DoubleClick, DoubleClick shall provide
      You with an escalation list of people within DoubleClick You can contact
      to resolve these issues, which list shall commence with Your Dedicated
      Technical Account Manager and proceed to the Vice President of Client
      Services.

      CUSTOM REPORTS

      Custom Reports: for each agreed upon custom report to be provided to You
      by DoubleClick, the rates will be as follows:

      $|*|/month for daily delivery

      $|*|/month for weekly delivery

      $|*|/month for monthly delivery

      In addition, You shall have the right to receive one (1) type of daily
      Custom Report, which type of Custom Report is mutually agreed upon by the
      parties, free of charge for a period of one (1) year during the Term.

      MARKETING/PUBLICITY

      Upon execution of this Addendum No. 2, both parties agree to work
      together to develop a mutually agreed upon press release meant to inform
      the public of the parties' agreement set forth herein, such press
      release to be issued at a time to be mutually agreed upon by the
      parties. Upon Your prior approval, DoubleClick shall have the right to
      use Your name in DoubleClick's marketing materials promoting the
      Service.

      SERVICE LEVELS

      AD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AVAILABILITY: DoubleClick shall use commercially
      reasonable efforts to ensure that the Ad Management System is available
      for Your use at least ninety-seven percent (97%) of the time calculated
      on a calendar monthly basis; it being understood that Ad Management
      System "down" time shall exclude time (i) required for routine system
      maintenance not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours in any calendar month
      that is performed by DoubleClick so long as You are notified at least
      one (1) business day in advance (it being understood that (x) the Ad
      Management System is "down" for routine scheduled maintenance for up to
      ten (10) hours each Saturday between the hours of 8 AM to 4 PM Eastern
      standard time (DoubleClick agrees to provide Company with reasonable
      advanced notice should the hours for routine scheduled maintenance be
      adjusted in the future) and (y) advance notice shall not be required for
      such routine

      scheduled maintenance) and (ii) resulting from technical malfunctions in
      Your Web site's systems, or any other circumstances reasonably beyond
      DoubleClick's control (including without limitation, Internet delays,
      network congestion and ISP malfunctions). Notwithstanding Section 10 of
      the Agreement, in the event that Ad Management System unscheduled downtime
      exceeds ten percent (10%) in any thirty (30) day period, then You will
      have the one time right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days
      prior written notice to DoubleClick, such notice to be provided to
      DoubleClick within sixty (60) days of the applicable period during which
      the downtime occurred. The remedy stated above shall be Your sole remedy
      for any and all unavailability of the System.

      DART SERVICE AVAILABILITY: DoubleClick shall use commercially reasonable
      efforts to ensure that the DART Service delivers Ads at least ninety-eight
      and one half percent (98.5%) of the time, calculated on a calendar monthly
      basis, it being understood that "down time" (calculated as the difference
      between 100% and the actual percentage delivery of ads) shall exclude time
      (i) required for routine system maintenance not to exceed thirty (30)
      minutes in any calendar month that is performed by DoubleClick so long as
      such maintenance is performed during low volume periods, and (ii)
      resulting from technical malfunctions in the Web Sites' systems, or any
      other circumstances beyond DoubleClick's reasonable control (including
      without limitation, Internet delays, network congestion and ISP
      malfunctions). In the event that unscheduled downtime exceeds one and one
      half percent (1.5%) in any month, then You will have the one time right to
      terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to
      DoubleClick, such notice to be provided to DoubleClick within sixty (60)
      days of the applicable month during which the downtime occurred. The
      parties agree that the service level and remedy stated above shall not
      apply to advertisements served in those countries in which DoubleClick
      does not maintain a data center. The remedy stated above shall be Your
      sole remedy for any and all unavailability of the Service.

      DELIVERY DIFFERENTIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT: In order to adequately
      determine the latency, if any, caused by an advertisement served by
      DoubleClick onto the Target Site(s), You are required, at Your own cost
      and expense, to create a special URL for a l0k of HTML Web page which will
      be identical to a page within the Target Site, except that instead of
      containing the DoubleClick ad tag in the HTML for that page, the page
      should contain a standard l0k of HTML image GIF so that the specially
      created URL ("Page A") is identical in size and weight to the page within
      the Target Site ("Page B") it is meant to replicate. For ease of
      measurement, Page B should be a l0k of HTML page that contains a single
      DoubleClick ad tag accessing a 468 by 60 pixel Ad banner of l0k of HTML.
      Neither Page A or Page B should contain any other third party service such
      as Inktomi, Akamai, database calls, etc. Once Page A is created and Web
      enabled, the parties shall have Keynote (an independent third party Web
      monitoring entity) measure, on a regular basis, the download time of Page
      A as compared to the download time of Page B (the "Differential
      Measurement"), with You bearing the cost of such monitoring. For example,
      if the download time of Page A is 0.8 seconds and the download time of
      Page B is 1.2 seconds, the Differential Measurement would equal 400
      milliseconds. Both parties will have access to the Keynote measurements
      and the URL's of Page A and Page B in

      order to monitor the Differential Measurement. The parties agree that 800
      milliseconds shall be an acceptable performance differential level between
      Page A and Page B (the "Benchmark"). If for any consecutive and successive
      three (3) month period (each a "Period"), the mean Differential
      Measurement for each month of that Period is greater than the Benchmark,
      then You shall be entitled to receive a credit against Your next Monthly
      Service Fee equal to five percent (5%) of Your Monthly Service Fees for
      the Period in which the Differential Measurement was above the Benchmark.
      If for any Period, the mean Differential Measurement for each month of
      that Period is greater that 1,200 milliseconds, then You shall be entitled
      to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to
      DoubleClick. The parties agree that the service level and remedy stated
      above shall not apply to advertisements served in those countries in which
      DoubleClick does not maintain a data center. The remedy stated above shall
      be Your sole remedy for any and all Differential Measurements.

      PRIVACY

      Each party acknowledges that adherence to fair information collection
      practices is of utmost importance to the other. During the term of this
      Agreement, Company agrees that the Web Site (and if Company is an agency,
      Company will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure its clients' Web
      Site(s)) will feature an easy-to-understand privacy policy, linked at a
      minimum from the Web Site's home page, that, (i) in addition to the
      disclosures about Company's privacy practices, identifies the collection
      and use of information gathered in connection with DoubleClick's ad
      serving and reporting activities and (ii) offers the user an opportunity
      to opt out from such collection and use. DoubleClick suggests the
      following language be added to Company's privacy policy to satisfy the
      requirements in (i) and (ii) above: "We use third-party advertising
      companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may
      use information (not including your name, address, email address or
      telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order
      to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In
      the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party
      advertising Company may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your
      browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to
      know your choices about not having this information used by these
      companies, click here."[LINK TO URL to be provided by DoubleClick; see,
      for example, www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/ or
      http://www.privacychoices.org]. DoubleClick reserves the right to change
      its suggested disclosure upon written notice to Company, and if such
      change is required by law or governmental or industry regulation, Company
      agrees to cooperate to post such revised disclosure within three (3)
      business days following receipt of such notice, or otherwise post within
      five (5) business days following receipt of such notice such other
      disclosure as may be mutually agreeable to the parties. DoubleClick shall
      have the right to terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days prior
      written notice to Company if Company breaches this section and fails to
      remedy such breach within said thirty day period. In addition, You agree
      never to alter any DoubleClick ad placement tags so as to include any
      personally-identifiable or sensitive (i.e., information related to
      children under 14 years of age, sexual orientation, health or detailed
      financial information) information

      of any Visitors in such tags. DoubleClick shall have the right to
      immediately terminate this Agreement should You breach the prior sentence.
      Each party shall comply with its own stated privacy policy in connection
      with its delivery or receipt of the Service hereunder. Each party shall
      have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement should the other
      party breach the foregoing sentence.

      PRIOR CREDITS

      The parties agree that none of the prior credits which accrued to You and
      have not been used under the Agreement shall carry over to the extended

5.    The parties hereby agree that the following sentence shall be deleted from
      Section 5 of the Agreement:

      You shall not permit any of Your employees to access and use the Service
      or the System to book or modify ad placements unless any such employee has
      successfully completed the training session and has been so certified by
      DoubleClick. To access and view reports, Your employees are not required
      to attend training sessions.

      DoubleClick shall provide regular training at its New York and San
      Francisco training facilities for $|*| per training day. DoubleClick will
      provide You with credits for 2 training days, free of charge, per quarter.

6.    The parties hereby agree that the following sentence shall be deleted from
      Section 6 of the Agreement:

      To the extent that the average file size of all ad banners delivered via
      the Service in a given month ("Average Ad Size") exceeds the Ad Size Limit
      set forth on the Cover Page, the Monthly Service Fee payable for that
      month shall be increased by an amount that shall be calculated by
      subtracting the Ad Size Limit from the Average Ad Size, dividing that
      difference by the Ad Size Limit, and multiplying the quotient by the
      Monthly Service Fee CPM rate set forth on the Cover Page of this
      Agreement.

      And shall be replaced in its entirety with the following:
