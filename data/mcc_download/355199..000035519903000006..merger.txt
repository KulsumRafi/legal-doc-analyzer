         As a result of the Merger and the  conversion of the vested  options to
purchase  shares of Company  Capital  Stock set forth in Schedule  2.3(c) to the
Disclosure  Memorandum  (the  "Options")  into Essex Options as provided in this
Agreement,  holders of Company  Capital  Stock and Options  shall  receive total
consideration with an assigned value of $4,325,000 (the "Merger Consideration"),
which shall consist of the Share  Consideration as defined in Section 1.8.2 with
an assigned value of $3,723,164  (in the case of the Escrow  Shares,  subject to
adjustment  as provided in Section  1.8.3(b)(i)(B)  and Article VIII hereof) and
the  Option  Consideration  with an  assigned  value of  $601,836  as defined in
Section 1.8.4.

         1.8.2    SHARE CONSIDERATION

                  For purposes of this Agreement the term "Share  Consideration"
shall  mean the  aggregate  of (a) the cash paid to the  Principal  Shareholders
pursuant  to Section  1.8.3(b)(i)(A),  (b) the number of shares of Essex  common
stock,  no par value per share  (the  "Essex  Common  Stock"),  issuable  to the
Principal  Shareholders  pursuant to Sections  1.8.3(b)(i)(A) and 1.8.3(b)(i)(B)
below (in the case of the Escrow Shares as provided in Section 1.8.3(b)(i)(B)(y)
and Article  VIII  hereof),  and (c) the number of shares of Essex  Common Stock
issued to the  shareholders  of the Company who are not  Principal  Shareholders
(the "Other Shareholders") pursuant to Section 1.8.3(b)(ii) below.

         1.8.3    EXCHANGE RATIO; ESCROW SHARES

         As of the  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the  Merger and  without  any
action on the part of the holders thereof:

                  (a) All  shares of any class of capital  stock of the  Company
held by the Company as treasury shares shall be canceled.

                  (b) Each issued and  outstanding  share of common stock of the
Company (the  "Company  Capital  Stock")  shall be  converted  into the right to
receive Share Consideration as set forth below.

                           (i)  The  Principal  Shareholders  shall  receive  in
exchange for their shares of Company Capital
Stock the following:

                                    (A)     a cash payment of $309,000 delivered
within  thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, and 299,785 shares of Essex Common
Stock with an assigned  value of $926,336, to be allocated  among the  Principal
Shareholders  as set forth in EXHIBIT 1.8.3(B)(I)(A); and

                                    (B)  Shares of Essex  Common  Stock  with an
assigned  value of $2,332,664  (the "Determination  Price  Shares").  The actual
number of Determination Price Shares issuable to the Principal Shareholders will
be determined by dividing $2,332,664  by the  "Determination  Price," i.e.,  the
weighted average closing price of a share of Essex Common  Stock for the  twenty
(20) trading days  immediately preceding the first  anniversary of the Effective
Date (the "Pricing  Period"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding the actual
twenty (20) day  weighted average  closing price per  share,  the  Determination
Price shall not be greater than $7.00 nor less than $3.09 per share. The maximum
number of Determination Price Shares shall be 754,907 shares ($2,332,664 divided
by $3.09) (the

                                       3
<PAGE>

"Maximum DP Shares") and the minimum number of Determination  Price Shares shall
be 333,238 shares ($2,332,664 divided by $7.00).  Within ten (10) days following
the Closing Date, Essex shall:

                                            (x)    issue    205,000    of    the
Determination Price Shares (the "Initial Shares") to the  Principal Shareholders
to  be allocated  among them  according to  their respective holdings of Company
Capital Stock; and

                                            (y)   deposit   into   escrow   (the
"Escrow")  549,907  shares   of  Essex  Common  Stock  (the  "Escrow   Shares"),
representing the Maximum DP Shares  less the Initial Shares  issued  pursuant to
Section  1.8.3(b)(i)(B)(x)  above,  with  Whiteford, Taylor & Preston L.L.P., as
escrow agent (the "Escrow  Agent"),  to be  held and administered  by the Escrow
Agent  in  accordance  with an escrow  agreement  in  substantially  in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.8.3(B)(I)(B) (the "Escrow Agreement").   Within ten
(10) days  following its receipt of the Escrow  Shares, the Escrow  Agent  shall
cause  128,238 shares  (the  "Released  Shares") to be released to the Principal
Shareholders  to be allocated among them according to their respective  holdings
of Company Capital Stock.  If the Determination  Price  is less  than  $7.00 per
share then, within  ten (10) days following  the end of the Pricing  Period (the
"Final  Release  Date"),  the  Escrow Agent  shall  release a number  of  Escrow
Shares  to  the  Principal  Shareholders  determined  by the following formula:

  (a) divided by                                             (a) divided (b) less (c)       Article VIII hereof or
  (b) less (c)                                               are referred to                subject to pending
  less (d)                                                   as the "Final Determination    indemnification claims
                                                             Price Shares"

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

By way of example,  if the Determination Price is $5.00 per share, and no Escrow
Shares have been released from Escrow to Essex pursuant to Essex indemnification
claims made pursuant to Article VIII, then the Principal  Shareholders  would be
entitled to a distribution of 133,295 shares of Essex Common Stock ($2,332,664 /
5.00 less the Initial  Shares and the  Released  Shares = 133,295  shares).  All
Escrow Shares that are not (i) released to Essex pursuant to the indemnification
provisions  of Article VIII or (ii)  released  from the escrow to the  Principal
Shareholders pursuant to this Section  1.8.3(b)(i)(B)(y)  shall revert to Essex.
By executing this Agreement,  the Principal Shareholders shall agree to be bound
with respect to the  indemnification  obligations of the Principal  Shareholders
and the procedures set forth in Article VIII hereof.  Notwithstanding the escrow
of the Escrow Shares, dividends or other distributions declared and paid on such
shares  shall  continue to be paid by Essex to the holders of Escrow  Shares and
all voting  rights with respect to such shares shall inure to the benefit of and
be enjoyed by the Principal Shareholders.  Any securities received by the Escrow
Agent in respect of any  Escrow  Shares  held in Escrow as a result of any stock
split or  combination  of  shares  of Essex  Common  Stock,  payment  of a stock
dividend or other stock  distribution  in or on shares of Essex Common Stock, or
change of Essex Common Stock into any other securities  pursuant to or as a part
of a merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of  property  or  stock,  separation,
reorganization  or  liquidation  of Essex,  or  otherwise,  shall be held by the
Escrow Agent as, and shall be included within the definition of, Escrow Shares.

                           (ii) Each Other  Shareholder  shall receive  1.485652
shares of Essex Common Stock for each
share of Company  Capital  Stock owned by such  Shareholder,  resulting,  in the
aggregate,  in the issuance to the Other  Shareholders of 50,215 shares of Essex
Common Stock with an assigned value of $155,164.

<PAGE>


                  (c) Each issued and outstanding  share of capital stock of the
Purchaser  shall  continue to remain  outstanding as a share of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

         1.8.4    OPTION CONSIDERATION

         Each outstanding Option, whether or not exercisable, shall be converted
by Essex into an options to purchase  shares of Essex  Common  Stock (the "Essex
Options")   with  an  assigned   aggregate   value  of  $601,836   (the  "Option
Consideration")  determined  as set forth on  EXHIBIT  1.8.4  hereto.  The Essex
Options will be issued in the amounts and with  exercise  prices per share,  and
shall be  subject  to the other  terms and  conditions,  as set forth in EXHIBIT
1.8.4.  As of the Effective  Date, the Company's 1998 Stock Option and Ownership
Plan will terminate.

         1.8.5    EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         (a) On or following the Closing Date, the Shareholders  shall surrender
the  certificates  representing  their  shares of  Company  Capital  Stock  (the
"Company Stock  Certificates")  to Essex for  cancellation  together with a duly
completed and validly  executed  letter of  transmittal  in such form and having
such  provisions  that Essex may  reasonably  request and that are customary for
transactions  of  this  nature,  and  which  shall  provide  in part  that  such
Shareholder is acquiring the Essex Common Stock for investment  purposes and not
with a view to distribution thereof, and such other matters as Essex may require
in order to establish a private  placement  exemption  under the Securities Act.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock  Certificate  (or compliance  with  provisions
hereof with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed  certificates) for cancellation
to Essex, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Essex pursuant to
this  Agreement,  together with such letter of  transmittal,  duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Company  Stock  Certificate  shall be entitled to receive from Essex in exchange
therefor, a certificate  representing the number of whole shares of Essex Common
Stock  (less the  number of shares  of Escrow  Shares to be  deposited  with the
Escrow Agent on such  holder's  behalf  pursuant to Section  1.8.3(b)(i)(B)  and
Article  VIII hereof) to which such holder is  entitled,  and the Company  Stock
Certificate  so  surrendered  shall be  cancelled.  Until so  surrendered,  each
outstanding  Company  Stock  Certificate  will be deemed  for all  purposes,  to
evidence  the right to receive  the Share  Consideration.  In the event that any
certificates  representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen  or  destroyed,  upon the  making  of an  affidavit  of that  fact by the
shareholder  claiming such  certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed,  Essex
shall issue in  exchange  for such lost,  stolen or  destroyed  certificate  the
shares of Essex  Common  Stock  that such  shareholder  is  entitled  to receive
pursuant  to Section  1.8.3  hereof;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that Essex may in its
discretion and as a condition  precedent to the issuance  thereof,  require such
shareholder to provide Essex with an indemnity  agreement against any claim that
may be made against Essex with respect to the  certificate  alleged to have been
lost,  stolen  or  destroyed.  The  shares  of  Essex  Common  Stock  that  each
shareholder  shall be entitled to receive in connection with the Merger pursuant
to this Section 1.8.5, including the Escrow Shares, shall be deemed to have been
issued  at  the  Effective   Time.  No  interest   shall  accrue  on  the  Share
Consideration.  If the Share  Consideration  (or any  portion  thereof) is to be
delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the  certificate  or
certificates  representing  shares  of  Company  Capital  Stock  surrendered  in
exchange  therefor is registered,  it shall be a condition to such exchange that
the person  requesting  such  exchange  shall pay to Essex any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Share  Consideration  to a person
other  than  the  registered  holder  of  the  certificate  or  certificates  so
surrendered,  or shall establish to the  satisfaction of Essex that such tax has
been  paid  or is not  applicable.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary,
neither  Essex nor any other party  hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares
of  Company  Capital  Stock for any Share  Consideration  delivered  to a public
official pursuant to applicable law, including,  without  limitation,  abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws.

                                       5
<PAGE>

         (b) Essex  will be  entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from the Share
Consideration  such  amounts as Essex is  required to deduct and  withhold  with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign  tax law.  To the extent that  amounts  are so  withheld,  such
amounts will be treated for all  purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid
to the  former  holder of the  Company  Capital  Stock in  respect  of whom such
deduction and withholding were made by Essex.

         1.8.6    NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

         No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Essex Common
Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger,  and no dividend,  stock split or
other  distribution  with respect to Essex Common Stock shall relate to any such
fractional  interest,  and any such  fractional  interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder.

         1.8.7    NO FURTHER TRANSFERS

         After the Effective Time,  there shall be no transfers of any shares of
Company Capital Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving  Corporation.
If, after the  Effective  Time,  certificates  formerly  representing  shares of
Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation,  they shall be
forwarded to Essex and be canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Section
1.8.

1.9      AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE FOR ALTERNATIVE MERGER STRUCTURES

         If at any time  prior to the  Closing  Date,  Essex  elects to have the
Purchaser be the Surviving  Corporation or elects to have the Company merge with
and into Essex or have a different subsidiary of Essex merge with the Company in
a forward or reverse triangular merger, the parties shall promptly enter into an
amendment  to this  Agreement  to so  provide,  so long as such  action does not
result in a breach of a  representation  or  warranty  set forth in  Article  II
hereof or the inability to satisfy any of the  conditions  set forth in Articles
IV and V hereof.  Section  1.10(a)  and (b) shall be  amended  as  necessary  to
reflect any amendment under this Section 1.9.

1.10     REORGANIZATION TAX TREATMENT

         (a) Except as otherwise  required by the Internal  Revenue Service (the
"IRS") pursuant to a  determination  (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or
otherwise,  or by  applicable  law, the parties shall not take a position on any
tax returns  inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger for tax purposes as a
reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code by reason
of Section  368(a)(2)(D)  of the Code,  in the case of the merger of the Company
with and into the Purchaser with the Purchaser being the surviving  corporation,
by reason of Section  368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, in the case of any merger of the
Purchaser  with and into  the  Company  with the  Company  being  the  surviving
corporation,  or by reason of Section  368(a)(1)(A)  itself,  in the case of the
merger of the Company with and into Essex.

         (b) The Company  represents that it has not taken any action that would
prevent the Merger from meeting the  requirement  under Section  368(a)(2)(E) of
the Code that  "substantially all of the assets" of the Company must be acquired
in the Merger.

         (c)  Neither  Essex  nor the  Purchaser  makes  any  representation  or
warranty with respect to any Tax consequences to the Company or its shareholders
arising  under this  Agreement or as a result of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.

         The shares of Essex Common Stock to be issued  pursuant to this Article
I shall  not have been  registered  and shall be  characterized  as  "restricted

         2.14.3   COMPLIANCE

         With respect to each Employee  Benefit Plan, (a) such Employee  Benefit
Plan is, and at all times since its inception has been, maintained, administered
and  operated  in all  material  respects  in  accordance  with its terms and in
compliance with all applicable laws,  statutes,  orders,  rules and regulations,
and all requirements  prescribed thereby,  including,  but not limited to, ERISA
and the Code;  (b) all  amendments  and actions  required to bring such Employee
Benefit Plan into conformity with the applicable  provisions of ERISA,  the Code
and other  applicable  laws and  regulations  have been made or taken within the
time prescribed by law, except to the extent that such amendments or actions are
not  required by law to be made or taken until after the Closing  Date;  (c) the
Company,  each  fiduciary of such  Employee  Benefit Plan and all other  Persons
have, at all times,  properly  performed  all  obligations,  whether  arising by
operation  of law or by  contract,  required to be  performed by each of them in
connection with such Employee  Benefit Plan; (d) all returns,  reports and other
disclosures relating to such Employee Benefit Plan required to be filed with any
governmental  entity or agency or furnished to any  participant  or  beneficiary
have been  properly  completed  or prepared  and timely  filed or  furnished  in
accordance  with applicable law; (e) neither the Company nor any other fiduciary
of such Employee  Benefit Plan has engaged in any transaction or acted or failed
to act in a manner that  violates  the  fiduciary  requirements  of ERISA or any
other applicable law; and (f) no event has occurred or is threatened or about to
occur that  constitutes or could constitute a nonexempt  prohibited  transaction
under  Section  406 or 407 of ERISA  or under  Section  4975 of the  Code.  Each
Employee  Benefit Plan that  constitutes  a "group  health  plan," as defined in
Section  607(1) or 733(a)(1) of ERISA or Section  4980B(g)(2)  of the Code,  has
been  maintained,  administered and operated at all times since its inception in
compliance in all material respects with (and the Company has never violated, in
any material respect, any of) the requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B(f) of the Code, any regulations under such ERISA
and Code sections and any other applicable federal,  state, local or foreign law
regarding the provision or  continuation of health  insurance  coverage or other
welfare  benefits  (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA).  Each Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified  under Section  401(a) of the Code
is, and at all times since its  inception has been, so qualified and its related
trust or annuity  contract  is, and at all times since its  inception  has been,
exempt from taxation  under Section  501(a) of the Code,  and each such Employee
Benefit  Plan (and its  related  trust(s)  and/or  annuity  contract(s))  is the
subject  of an  unrevoked  favorable  determination,  opinion,  notification  or
advisory  letter from the IRS to that  effect or has  remaining a period of time
under applicable  Treasury  regulations or IRS  pronouncements in which to apply
for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain it. Nothing has
occurred since the most recent favorable determination, opinion, notification or
advisory  letter issued with respect to each such Employee  Benefit Plan, and no
circumstances  exist or are  reasonably  expected by the Company to occur,  that
could cause the Company (or such  Employee  Benefit Plan) to lose its ability to
rely on such  determination  letter  or  could  cause  the  IRS to  revoke  such
determination  letter.  No event or  omission  has  occurred,  or is  reasonably
expected  by the  Company to occur  (including,  but not  limited to, any of the
transactions contemplated in or by this Agreement), with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan that has or could subject,  directly or indirectly,  the Company or
any other  Person  to a tax  under  Chapter  43 of  Subtitle  D of the Code or a
penalty under Part 5 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

         2.14.4   CONTRIBUTIONS AND PREMIUM PAYMENTS

         All  contributions,  premiums and other  payments due or required to be
made to each  Employee  Benefit  Plan under the terms of such  Employee  Benefit
Plan,  ERISA, the Code or other applicable law have been timely paid, or, if not
yet due, have been properly recorded on the books of the Company.

independent   contractor  of  the  Company  or  any  other  entity  beyond  such

the Code.

         There are no actions,  suits or claims  (other than routine  claims for
benefits)  pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company Parties,  threatened
with respect to (or against the assets of) any Employee  Benefit  Plan,  nor, to
the best knowledge of the Company Parties, is there a basis for any such action,
suit or claim. No Employee Benefit Plan is currently under investigation,  audit
or review,  directly or  indirectly,  by the IRS, the  Department  of Labor (the
"DOL") or any other governmental entity or agency, and, to the best knowledge of
the Company  Parties,  no such action is contemplated or under  consideration by
the IRS, the DOL or any other governmental entity or agency.

         2.14.9   PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS

         Neither the  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement  or any of the
other Operative Documents nor the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
in (or by) this  Agreement  or any of the  other  Operative  Documents  will (a)
entitle any current or former officer,  employee, agent, director or independent
contractor of the Company to severance  pay,  unemployment  compensation  or any
other  payment from the Company or any other Person,  or otherwise  increase the
amount of compensation due to any such individual,  or (b) result in any benefit
or right becoming established or increased, or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of any benefit,  under any Employee  Benefit  Plan,  whether or not some
other  subsequent  action or event would be required to trigger any of the items
specified in (a) or (b) above.

after the date of such Form 10-KSB, and its Proxy Statement relating to its 2002
Annual Meeting of  Shareholders  (collectively,  the "SEC  Documents").  The SEC
Documents  did not on their  dates of  filing  contain  an untrue  statement  of
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated  therein in
order to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not  misleading.  Since January 1, 2001,  Essex has timely filed

financial statements).

3.9      ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

         Except as and to the extent (a) reflected in the balance sheet of Essex

or to become due),  for any period ending on or before the date  thereof,  which
liabilities or obligations  would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet
of Essex prepared in accordance with GAAP.

set forth in the SEC  Documents,  to the best  knowledge of Essex,  there are no
such proceedings threatened or contemplated or any unasserted claims (whether or
not the  potential  claimant  may be aware of the  claim),  which  would  have a
Material Adverse Effect on Essex.

8.2      INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

         Subject to the  limitations  set forth in this Article  VIII,  from and
after  the  Closing,  each  of  the  Principal  Shareholders  (the  "Shareholder
Indemnifying  Parties") shall indemnify and hold Essex, its officers,  directors
and  affiliates  (as  "affiliate"  is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act)
(the "Essex Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and shall reimburse
the Essex Indemnified  Parties for, any and all actual losses,  damages,  debts,
liabilities,   obligations,   judgments,  orders,  awards,  writs,  injunctions,
decrees, fines, penalties,  Taxes, costs or expenses (including, but not limited
to, any reasonable legal or accounting fees or expenses  ("Losses")  arising out
of (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation  in, or breach of, any representation
or warranty made by the Company and the Principal Shareholders in this Agreement
or in any other  Operative  Document  or (ii) any  failure by the Company or the
Principal  Shareholders  to  perform or  comply,  in whole or in part,  with any
covenant or agreement  in this  Agreement  or in any other  Operative  Document.
Except as provided in the following sentences,  the obligations of the Principal
Shareholders hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the assigned value
of the Merger Consideration received by the Principal Shareholders of $3,751,626
(the  "Maximum  Indemnity  Obligation").  In the event that the actual  weighted
average closing price of a share of Essex Common Stock during the Pricing Period
is less than $3.09, then, in such event, the Maximum Indemnity  Obligation shall
be  reduced  by an  amount  equal to the  product  of (i)  421,669  and (ii) the
difference  between (a) $3.09 and (b) the said actual  twenty (20) day  weighted
average  closing  price of a share of Essex  Common  Stock  during  the  Pricing
Period.  In the event that the number of Final  Determination  Price  Shares (as
defined in Section 1.8.3(b)(i)(B)(y)) is less than the number of shares of Essex
Common Stock (x) released to Essex pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
this Article VIII or (y) subject to pending  indemnification  claims, then Essex
shall be entitled to recover the deficiency amount.

8.3      INDEMNIFICATION BY ESSEX

         Subject to the  limitations  set forth in this Article  VIII,  from and
after the Closing,  Essex (the "Essex  Indemnifying  Party") shall indemnify and
hold the Principal Shareholders (the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties") harmless
from and against,  and shall reimburse the Shareholder  Indemnified Parties for,
any and all Losses arising out of (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or
breach of, any  representation or warranty made by Essex in this Agreement or in
any other Operative  Document or (ii) any failure by Essex to perform or comply,
in whole or in part,  with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or in any
other Operative Document.  The obligation the Essex Indemnifying Party hereunder
shall be limited to the amount of the Maximum Indemnity Obligation.

8.4      TERMINOLOGY; THRESHOLD AND LIMITATIONS INDEMNIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT OF
         SHARE CONSIDERATION

         (a) For purposes of this Article VIII (i) the Essex  Indemnifying Party
and the  Shareholder  Indemnifying  Parties  shall be  referred to herein as the
"Indemnifying  Parties" or an  "Indemnifying  Party" as the context requires and
(ii) the Essex Indemnified Parties and the Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall
be referred to as the  "Indemnified  Parties" or an  "Indemnified  Party" as the
context requires.

         (b)  An  Indemnified  Party  shall  not  be  entitled  to  receive  any
indemnification  payment  with respect to any claims for  indemnification  under
this Article VIII ("Claims") until the aggregate Losses for which an Indemnified
Party would otherwise be entitled to receive  indemnification exceed Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the "Threshold");  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that once such
aggregate Losses exceed the Threshold, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification  for the aggregate  amount of all Losses  without  regard to the
Threshold.

                                       35
<PAGE>

         (c) The  indemnification  obligations of the  Shareholder  Indemnifying
Parties  under  this  Article  VIII may be,  but  shall not be  required  to be,
satisfied  through  reduction  of the  number of Escrow  Shares  payable  to the
Principal Shareholders. The number of Escrow Shares to be used as payment of any
Claims shall be determined  by dividing (x) the aggregate  dollar amount of such
Claims by (y) the  weighted  average  closing  price of a share of Essex  Common
Stock for the twenty (20) trading  days  immediately  preceding  the date of the
Claim  Notice  delivered  by Essex to the  Principal  Shareholders  pursuant  to
Section  8.6(a)  hereof.  The  aggregate  value of Claims  paid by means of such
reduction  of  Escrow   Shares  shall  be  deemed  to  reduce  the  total  Share
Consideration  otherwise  payable  to the  Principal  Shareholders  pursuant  to
Section 1.8 of this  Agreement.  Any such  Claims  shall be deemed to reduce the
Escrow  Shares,  pro rata with respect to each  Shareholder,  as  determined  by
reference  to the  number of shares  comprising  the  Share  Consideration  such
Principal  Shareholder  is  entitled to receive in the Merger as compared to all
other Principal Shareholders.

8.5      NOTIFICATION OF INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS

         An  Indemnifying  Party  shall  not be  obligated  to  defend  and hold
harmless an  Indemnified  Party,  or  otherwise  be liable to such  party,  with
respect to any Claims made by the Indemnified  Party after the expiration of the
applicable time period as set forth in Section 8.1 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  indemnity may be sought after the expiration of the Survival  Period
pursuant to this Article  VIII if a Claim  Notice (as defined in Section  8.6(a)
hereof)  shall have been  delivered  to the  Indemnifying  Parties  prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period.

8.6      PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "Claim Notice")
of any Claim for  indemnification  under this Article  VIII to the  Indemnifying
Party reasonably  promptly after the assertion  against an Indemnified  Party of
any Claim by a third party (a "Third  Party  Claim") or, if such Claim is not in
respect of a Third Party Claim, reasonably promptly after the discovery of facts
upon which the  Indemnified  Party  intends to base a Claim for  indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the failure or delay to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
obligation or liability that the Indemnifying  Party may have to the Indemnified
Party except to the extent that the indemnifying  party  demonstrates  that his,
her or its  ability  to defend  or  resolve  such  Claim is  adversely  affected
thereby.

         (b) (i)  Subject  to the  rights of or duties to any  insurer  or other
third party having potential  liability  therefor,  an Indemnifying  Party shall
have the right,  upon  written  notice  given by the  Indemnifying  Party to the
Indemnified  Party  within  thirty (30) days after  receipt by the  Indemnifying
Party of the notice  from the  Indemnified  Party of any Third Party  Claim,  to
assume the defense or  handling  of such Third  Party Claim at the  indemnifying
party's sole expense,  in which case the provisions of Section 8.4(c)(ii) hereof
shall govern; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that,  notwithstanding the foregoing, an Essex
Indemnified  Party may elect to assume  the  defense  and  handle any such Third
Party Claim if it  determines  in good faith that the  resolution  of such Third
Party  Claim  could  result in an adverse  impact on its  business,  operations,
assets,  liabilities  (absolute,  accrued,  contingent or otherwise),  condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects,  in which case the  provisions of Section
8.6(c)(ii) hereof shall govern.

                  (ii) The  Indemnifying  Party shall select counsel  reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party in connection with conducting the defense or
handling of such Third Party Claim, and the  Indemnifying  Party shall defend or
handle the same in consultation  with the  Indemnified  Party and shall keep the
Indemnified  Party timely apprised of the status of such Third Party Claim.  The
Indemnifying

                                       36

<PAGE>

Party shall not,  without the prior written  consent of the  Indemnified  Party,
agree to a  settlement  of any Third  Party  Claim,  unless  (A) the  settlement
provides an unconditional release and discharge of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified  Party is reasonably  satisfied  with such discharge and release and
(B) the  Indemnified  Party  shall  not  have  reasonably  objected  to any such
settlement on the ground that the circumstances surrounding the settlement could
result in an adverse  impact on the business,  operations,  assets,  liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), condition (financial or otherwise)
or prospects of the Indemnified  Party.  The  Indemnified  Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying  Party and shall be entitled to participate in the defense
or  handling  of such  Third  Party  Claim with its own  counsel  and at its own
expense.

         (c) (i) If (A) the  Indemnifying  Party does not give written notice to
the  Indemnified  Party  pursuant to Section  8.6(b)(i)  within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the notice from the Indemnified  Party of any Third Party Claim
of the  Indemnifying  Party's election to assume the defense or handling of such
Third Party Claim or (B) an Essex Indemnified Party elects to assume the defense
and the handling of such Third Party Claim  pursuant to Section  8.6(b)(i),  the
provisions of Section 8.6(c)(ii) hereof shall govern.

                  (ii) The Indemnified  Party may, at the  Indemnifying  Party's
expense (which shall be paid from time to time by the Indemnifying Party as such
expenses  are  incurred  by  the  Indemnified  Party),  select  counsel,   after
consultation  with the  Indemnifying  Party,  in connection  with conducting the
defense or  handling  of such Third  Party Claim and defend or handle such Third
Party  Claim in such  manner  as the  Indemnified  Party  may deem  appropriate;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
timely  apprised  of the status of such Third  Party  Claim and shall not settle
such Third Party Claim  without the prior  written  consent of the  Indemnifying
Party,  which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld.  If the  Indemnified
Party defends or handles such Third Party Claim,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party and shall be entitled to participate in the
defense or  handling  of such Third  Party Claim with its own counsel and at its
own expense.

8.7      REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

         The indemnification provisions of this Article VIII are in addition to,
and not in  derogation  of,  any  statutory,  equitable  or common law remedy an
Indemnified  Party  may have  for  breach  of any  representation,  warranty  or
covenant contained herein. Each of the parties  acknowledges and agrees that the
other  parties  hereto  would be  damaged  irreparably  in the  event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached.  Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees
that the other  parties  hereto  shall be entitled to an  injunction  to prevent
breaches of the  provisions of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically  this
Agreement and the terms and provisions  hereof  (including  the  indemnification
provisions hereof) in any competent court having  jurisdiction over the parties,
in  addition  to any other  remedy to which  they may be  entitled  at law or in
equity.
