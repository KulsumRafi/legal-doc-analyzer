having  ordinary  voting  power  for  the  election  of  directors  (or  persons

<PAGE>
                                       17

During the Commitment  Period the Borrower may use the Commitments by borrowing,
prepaying the Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with
the terms  and  conditions  hereof.  The  Dollar  Loans may from time to time be
Eurocurrency  Loans or ABR Loans,  as determined by the Borrower and notified to
the  Administrative  Agent in accordance  with Sections 2.2 and 2.7. All Foreign
Currency Loans shall be Eurocurrency Loans.

     2.2  Procedure  for  Borrowing.  (a) The Borrower  may borrow  Dollar Loans
during the  Commitment  Period on any Business  Day,  provided that the Borrower
shall give the  Administrative  Agent  irrevocable  notice (which notice must be
received  by the  Administrative  Agent (a) prior to 10:00  A.M.,  New York City
time, three Business Days prior to the requested  Borrowing Date, in the case of
Eurocurrency  Loans or (b)  prior to 11:00  A.M.,  New York  City  time,  on the
requested  Borrowing Date, in the case of ABR Loans),  specifying (i) the amount
and Type of Dollar Loans to be borrowed,  (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, and
(iii) in the case of  Eurocurrency  Loans,  the respective  amounts of each such
Type of Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor.
Any Dollar  Loans made on the Closing Date shall  initially  be ABR Loans.  Each
borrowing of Dollar Loans under the  Commitments  shall be in an amount equal to
(x) in the case of ABR Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof (or, if the
then  aggregate  Available  Commitments  are less than  $1,000,000,  such lesser
amount)  and  (y) in the  case of  Eurocurrency  Loans,  $10,000,000  or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess  thereof.  Upon receipt of any such notice from
the  Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  each Lender
thereof.  Each  Lender  will  make  the  amount  of its pro  rata  share of each
borrowing available to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Borrower
at the Funding  Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Borrowing
Date  requested  by  the  Borrower  in  funds   immediately   available  to  the
Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower
by the  Administrative  Agent crediting the account of the Borrower on the books
of  such  Office  with  the  aggregate  of the  amounts  made  available  to the
Administrative  Agent  by the  Lenders  and in like  funds  as  received  by the
Administrative Agent.

     (b) The Borrower may borrow  Foreign  Currency  Loans during the Commitment
Period  on  any  Business  Day,  provided  that  the  Borrower  shall  give  the
Administrative  Agent  irrevocable  notice (which notice must be received by the
Administrative  Agent prior to 10:00 A.M.,  New York City time,  three  Business
Days  prior to the  requested  Borrowing  Date),  specifying  (i) the  requested
Borrowing  Date,  (ii) the respective  amounts of each Foreign  Currency Loan in
each Foreign  Currency and (iii) the respective  lengths of the initial Interest
Period therefor. Each Foreign Currency Loan under the Commitments shall be in an
amount  equal  to (x) in the  case of  Foreign  Currency  Loans  denominated  in
Sterling,  (pound)7,000,000  or a whole  multiple  of  (pound)500,000  in excess
thereof,  (y) in the  case of  Foreign  Currency  Loans  denominated  in  Euros,
(euro)10,000,000  or a whole multiple of (euro)1,000,000 in excess thereof,  and
(z) in the case of Foreign Currency Loans denominated in Yen,  Y1,000,000,000 or
a whole multiple of  Y100,000,000  in excess  thereof.  Upon receipt of any such
notice from the Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender  thereof.  Each Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each
borrowing available to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Borrower
at the Funding  Office prior to 12:00 Noon,  London time,  in each case,  on the
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds  immediately  available in the
relevant Foreign Currency to the Administrative  Agent. Such borrowing will then
be made  available to the Borrower by the  Administrative  Agent  crediting  the
account of the  Borrower on the books of such Office with the  aggregate  of the
amounts made  available to the  Administrative  Agent by the Lenders and in like
<PAGE>
                                       18
funds  as  received  by the  Administrative  Agent or by wire  transfer  of such
amounts  to  an  account   designated   in  writing  by  the   Borrower  to  the
Administrative Agent in connection with the relevant borrowing.

     2.3 Fees. (a) The Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent for
the account of each Lender a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") for the period from
and including the date hereof to the date upon which the Commitments  shall have
terminated  and all Loans  shall have been paid in full,  computed at a rate per
annum  equal  to the  Facility  Fee  Rate on the  average  daily  amount  of the
Commitment of such Lender (whether or not utilized)  during the period for which
payment  is made  (or,  if any  Lender  continues  to have any  Loans  after its
Commitment  terminates,  on the average daily amount of such Lender's Loans from
and including the date on which its  Commitment  terminates to but excluding the
date on which  such  Lender  ceases to have any Loans  outstanding),  payable in
arrears on each Fee Payment Date.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account
of each  Lender in  arrears  on each Fee  Payment  Date,  a  utilization  fee (a
"Utilization  Fee") at a rate per annum  equal to the  Utilization  Fee Rate for
each Excess  Utilization  Day during the period covered by such Fee Payment Date
on such Lender's Loans then outstanding on such Excess Utilization Day.

     (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent the fees in the
amounts and on the dates as set forth in the Fee Letter, dated as of November 1,
2002,  between the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent, and in any other fee
agreements between the Borrower and the  Administrative  executed after the date
of this Agreement,  and to perform any other obligations  contained therein. 2.4

right,  upon not less than three  Business  Days'  notice to the  Administrative
Agent,  to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount
of  the  Commitments;   provided  that  no  such  termination  or  reduction  of
Commitments  shall be  permitted  if,  after  giving  effect  thereto and to any
prepayments  of the Loans,  the Total Loans would exceed the Total  Commitments.
Any such reduction  shall be in an amount equal to  $10,000,000,  or an integral
multiple of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof,  and shall reduce  permanently  the
Commitments then in effect.

     2.4 Optional  Termination or Reduction of  Commitments.  The Borrower shall
have  the  right,  upon  not  less  than  three  Business  Days'  notice  to the
Administrative  Agent,  to terminate the  Commitments  or, from time to time, to
reduce the  amount of the  Commitments;  provided  that no such  termination  or
reduction of Commitments  shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and
to any  prepayments  of the  Loans,  the  Total  Loans  would  exceed  the Total
Commitments.  Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000,  or
an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall reduce
permanently the Commitments then in effect.

     2.5  Optional  Prepayments.  The  Borrower may at any time and from time to
time prepay the Loans,  in whole or in part,  without  premium or penalty,  upon
irrevocable  notice delivered to the  Administrative  Agent not later than 10:00

in the case of Eurocurrency  Loans, and not later than 11:00 A.M., New York City
time,  one  Business  Day  prior to the date of  prepayment,  in the case of ABR
Loans,  which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether
the prepayment is of Eurocurrency  Loans or ABR Loans and, if such prepayment is
of Foreign Currency Loans, the applicable Foreign Currency;  provided, that if a
Eurocurrency  Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest
Period  applicable  thereto,  the  Borrower  shall  also pay any  amounts  owing
pursuant to Section  2.16.  Upon  receipt of any such notice the  Administrative
Agent shall promptly  notify each Lender  thereof.  If any such notice is given,
the  amount  specified  in such  notice  shall  be due and  payable  on the date
specified  therein,  together  with  (except  in the case of Loans  that are ABR
<PAGE>
                                       19

Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid.  Partial prepayments

whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Partial  prepayments of Foreign

     2.6 Mandatory Prepayments.  If, on any date, the Total Loans outstanding on
such date  exceed  102% of the Total  Commitments  in effect on such  date,  the
Borrower  shall,  without notice or demand,  promptly (but in any event,  within
three Business Days of such date) prepay such outstanding  Loans in an aggregate
principal amount such that, after giving effect thereto,  the Total Loans do not
exceed the Total Commitments. Any amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section shall
be  accompanied  by  interest  accrued  to the  date of such  prepayment  on the
principal so prepaid and any amounts  payable  under  Section 2.16 in connection
therewith.

made on the last day of an Interest  Period with respect  thereto.  The Borrower
may elect  from time to time to  convert  its ABR  Loans to  Eurocurrency  Loans
denominated in Dollars by giving the Administrative  Agent irrevocable notice of
such election  (which  notice shall  specify the length of the initial  Interest
Period  therefor) not later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time,  three Business
Days prior to the date of conversion, provided that no ABR Loan may be converted
into a  Eurocurrency  Loan  when  any  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is

in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions.  Upon receipt of
any such  notice the  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify each Lender
thereof.

     (b) Any  Eurocurrency  Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of
the then current  Interest  Period with respect  thereto by the Borrower  giving
irrevocable  notice  to  the  Administrative   Agent,  in  accordance  with  the
applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of
the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans,  provided
that no Eurocurrency  Loan  denominated in Dollars may be continued as such when
any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent
has or the Required  Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not
to permit such continuation,  and provided,  further, that if the Borrower shall
fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such
continuation is not permitted  pursuant to the preceding  proviso any such Loans
denominated in Dollars shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last
day of such then  expiring  Interest  Period and, if the Borrower  shall fail to
give such  notice of  continuation  of a Foreign  Currency  Loan,  such  Foreign
Currency Loan shall be  automatically  continued  for an Interest  Period of one
month. Upon receipt of any such notice the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly
notify each relevant Lender thereof.

     2.8 Limitations on Eurocurrency Tranches.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Agreement,  all borrowings,  conversions and  continuations  of
<PAGE>

to each Lender on the Termination Date (or such earlier date as the Loans become
due and payable pursuant to Section 7), the unpaid principal amount of each Loan
made by such  Lender.  The  Borrower  hereby  further  agrees to pay interest in
immediately  available  funds at the office of the  Administrative  Agent on the
unpaid  principal  amount of such Loans  from time to time from the date  hereof
until  payment in full  thereof at the rates per  annum,  and on the dates,  set
forth in Section 2.10.

     2.10 Interest Rates and Payment  Dates.  (a) Each  Eurocurrency  Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the  Eurocurrency  Rate determined for such day plus the
Eurocurrency Applicable Margin.

     (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR.

     (c) (i) If all or a portion of the  principal  amount of any Loan shall not
be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
such overdue  amount  shall bear  interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate
that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing  provisions
of this Section plus 2% and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest  payable on
any  Loan  or any  facility  fee or  utilization  fee or  other  amount  payable
hereunder  shall  not be paid  when due  (whether  at the  stated  maturity,  by
acceleration  or  otherwise),  such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate
per annum equal to the rate then  applicable  to ABR Loans plus 2% (unless  such
overdue amount is denominated in a Foreign Currency,  in which case such overdue
amount  shall bear  interest of a rate per annum equal to the highest  rate then
applicable  under this Agreement to Foreign  Currency Loans  denominated in such
Foreign  Currency  plus 2%), in each case,  with respect to clauses (i) and (ii)

pursuant  hereto  shall be  calculated  on the basis of a  360-day  year for the
actual days  elapsed,  except  that,  with  respect to (i) ABR Loans the rate of
interest on which is  calculated  on the basis of the Prime Rate,  the  interest
thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be)
day year for the actual days elapsed and (ii) Foreign Currency Loans denominated
in Sterling,  interest  shall be  calculated  on the basis of a 365-day year for
actual days  elapsed.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall as soon as  practicable
notify  the  Borrower  and  the  relevant  Lenders  of each  determination  of a
Eurocurrency  Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan  resulting from a
change  in the  Eurocurrency  Applicable  Margin,  the  ABR or the  Eurocurrency

day on which such change becomes effective.  The  Administrative  Agent shall as

                                       21

soon as  practicable  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  relevant  Lenders  of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

     (b) Each  determination  of an interest  rate by the  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to any provision of this  Agreement  shall be conclusive and binding on
the  Borrower  and the relevant  Lenders in the absence of manifest  error.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall,  at the  request of the  Borrower,  deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative  Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.10(a).

     2.12 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any
Interest Period:

     (a) the  Administrative  Agent shall have determined  (which  determination
shall  be  conclusive  and  binding  upon  the  Borrower)  that,  by  reason  of
circumstances  affecting the relevant  market,  adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period,

     (b) the  Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from the Required
Lenders that the  Eurocurrency  Rate  determined  or to be  determined  for such
Interest  Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the relevant
Lenders (as  conclusively  certified by such  Lenders) of making or  maintaining
their affected Loans during such Interest Period, or

     (c) the  Administrative  Agent  determines  (which  determination  shall be
conclusive  and binding  upon the  Borrower)  that  deposits  in the  applicable
currency  are not  generally  available,  or cannot be obtained by the  relevant
Lenders,  in  the  applicable  market  (any  Foreign  Currency  affected  by the
circumstances described in clause (a), (b) or (c) is referred to as an "Affected
Foreign  Currency"),

then the  Administrative  Agent shall give  telecopy or  telephonic  notice
thereof  to the  Borrower  and the  relevant  Lenders  as  soon  as  practicable
thereafter.  If such  notice is given (x)  pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this
Section 2.12 in respect of Eurocurrency  Loans denominated in Dollars,  then (i)
any Eurocurrency  Loans denominated in Dollars requested to be made on the first
day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans,  (ii) any ABR Loans that
were to  have  been  converted  on the  first  day of such  Interest  Period  to
Eurocurrency  Loans  denominated  in Dollars shall be continued as ABR Loans and
(iii)  any  outstanding  Eurocurrency  Loans  denominated  in  Dollars  shall be
converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans and
(y) in respect of any Foreign  Currency  Loans,  then (i) any  Foreign  Currency
Loans in an Affected Foreign  Currency  requested to be made on the first day of
such Interest Period shall not be made and (ii) any outstanding Foreign Currency
Loans in an Affected  Foreign  Currency shall be due and payable on the last day
of the  then-current  Interest  Period.  Until  such  relevant  notice  has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurocurrency Loans denominated
in Dollars or Foreign  Currency Loans in an Affected  Foreign  Currency shall be
made or continued as such,  nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert ABR
Loans to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars.

     2.13 Pro Rata  Treatment and Payments.  (a) Each  borrowing by the Borrower
from the  Lenders  hereunder,  each  payment by the  Borrower  on account of any
<PAGE>
                                       22

facility fee or  utilization  fee and any  reduction of the  Commitments  of the
Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective  Loan  Percentages of
the Lenders.

     (b) Each payment  (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of
principal of and  interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata  according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the Lenders.

     (c) All  payments  (including  prepayments)  to be  made  by the  Borrower,
whether on account of  principal,  interest,  fees or  otherwise,  shall be made
without setoff or  counterclaim  and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York
City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative  Agent, for the account
of the relevant Lenders, at its Funding Office, in immediately  available funds.
Except as otherwise  specified in this  Agreement,  amounts  owing  hereunder on
account of  principal  and  interest on Loans  shall be paid in the  currency in
which such Loan was  borrowed,  and amounts  owing  hereunder on account of fees
shall  be paid in  Dollars.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  distribute  such
payments  to the  relevant  Lenders  promptly  upon  receipt  in like  funds  as
received.  If any payment  hereunder  (other than  payments on the  Eurocurrency
Loans)  becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be  extended  to the next  succeeding  Business  Day.  If any payment on a
Eurocurrency  Loan  becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business  Day,
the  maturity  thereof  shall be extended to the next  succeeding  Business  Day
unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another
calendar  month,  in which event such payment  shall be made on the  immediately
preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal
pursuant to the preceding two  sentences,  interest  thereon shall be payable at
the then applicable rate during such extension.

     (d) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have been notified in writing by
any Lender  prior to a borrowing  that such Lender will not make the amount that
would  constitute  its share of such borrowing  available to the  Administrative
Agent,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that such  Lender is making  such
amount available to the Administrative  Agent, and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative  Agent by the
required  time on the  Borrowing  Date  therefor,  such Lender  shall pay to the
Administrative  Agent,  on  demand,  (i) in the case of amounts  denominated  in
Dollars, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the greater of (x)
the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation,  for
the period  until such Lender  makes such amount  immediately  available  to the
Administrative  Agent  or (ii) in the case of  amounts  denominated  in  Foreign
Currencies,  such  amount  with  interest  thereon at a rate  determined  by the
Administrative  Agent to be the cost to it of  funding  such  amount  until such
Lender makes such amount immediately  available to the  Administrative  Agent. A
certificate of the Administrative  Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to
any amounts  owing under this  paragraph  shall be  conclusive in the absence of
manifest  error.  If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such
Borrowing Date, the  Administrative  Agent shall also be entitled to recover (i)
in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, such amount with interest thereon
at the rate per annum  applicable to ABR Loans, on demand,  from the Borrower or
(ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Foreign Currencies,  such amount with
interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative  Agent to be the sum
<PAGE>
                                       23

of (x)  the  cost  to it of  funding  such  amount  plus  (y)  the  Eurocurrency
Applicable Margin, on demand,  from the Borrower.  The failure or refusal of any
Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
borrowing  shall  not  relieve  any other  Lender  from its  several  obligation
hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other
Lender's  share of such  borrowing.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
rights of the  Borrower  against  any Lender  that has failed or refused to make
available such Lender's share of any borrowing.

     (e) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have been notified in writing by
the  Borrower  prior to the date of any payment  due to be made by the  Borrower
hereunder  that the Borrower  will not make such  payment to the  Administrative
Agent,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that the  Borrower is making such
payment,  and the  Administrative  Agent may,  but shall not be required  to, in
reliance upon such  assumption,  make available to the Lenders their  respective
pro rata shares of a  corresponding  amount.  If such payment is not made to the
Administrative  Agent by the Borrower  within three Business Days after such due
date, the  Administrative  Agent shall be entitled to recover,  on demand,  from
each relevant  Lender to which any amount which was made  available  pursuant to
the preceding sentence,  (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, such
amount with  interest  thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily  average
Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate and (ii) in the case of amounts  denominated  in
Foreign  Currencies,  such  amount  with  interest  thereon  at a rate per annum
determined  by the  Administrative  Agent to be the cost to it of  funding  such
amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender against the Borrower with respect to such payment.

     2.14  Requirements  of Law.  (a) If the  adoption  of or any  change in any
Requirement  of Law or in  the  interpretation  or  application  thereof  by any
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof
or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority  made
subsequent to the date hereof:

     (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect
to this  Agreement  or any Loan made by it, or change the basis of  taxation  of
payments  to such  Lender in respect  thereof  (except  for  Non-Excluded  Taxes
covered by Section 2.15 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income
of such Lender);

     (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,  special deposit,
compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other
liabilities  in or for the account of,  advances,  loans or other  extensions of
credit by, or any other  acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that
is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or

     (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other  condition  relating to funding
of assets that would include the  Eurodollar  Loans or the income or earnings in
respect  thereof  (except for  Non-Excluded  Taxes  covered by Section  2.15 and
changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
<PAGE>
                                       24

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount  that such  Lender  reasonably  deems to be  material,  of  making,
converting into, continuing or maintaining  Eurocurrency Loans, or to reduce any
amount  receivable  hereunder in respect  thereof,  then, in any such case,  the
Borrower  shall,  promptly after its receipt of a notice with respect thereto in
accordance  with  Section  2.14(d),  pay  such  Lender,  upon  its  demand,  any
additional  amounts  necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost
or reduced amount receivable.

     (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably  determined that the adoption of or
any  change in any  Requirement  of Law  regarding  capital  adequacy  or in the
interpretation or application  thereof by a Governmental  Authority charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation  controlling  such Lender with any  request or  directive  regarding
capital adequacy  (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority  made  subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing
the  rate  of  return  on  such  Lender's  or such  corporation's  capital  as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender
or such  corporation  could  have  achieved  but for such  adoption,  change  or
compliance  (taking  into  consideration  such  Lender's  or such  corporation's
policies  with respect to capital  adequacy) by an amount  reasonably  deemed by
such  Lender to be  material,  then from time to time,  after  such  Lender  has
provided  written  notice in  accordance  with  Section  2.14(d) to the Borrower
requesting  compensation  for such reduction under this paragraph,  the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender such  additional  amount or amounts as will  compensate
such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.

     (c) If  any  Governmental  Authority  of the  jurisdiction  of any  Foreign
Currency  (or any other  jurisdiction  in which the  funding  operations  of any
Lender shall be conducted with respect to such Foreign  Currency)  shall have in
effect any  reserve,  liquid  asset or similar  requirement  with respect to any
category  of  deposits  or  liabilities  customarily  used to fund loans in such
Foreign Currency, or by reference to which interest rates applicable to loans in
such Foreign Currency are determined,  and the result of such requirement  shall
be to  increase  the cost to such  Lender of making or  maintaining  any Foreign
Currency  Loan in such Foreign  Currency,  and such Lender shall  deliver to the
Borrower  a  written  notice  in  accordance  with  Section  2.14(d)  requesting
compensation  for such additional  cost under this paragraph,  then the Borrower
will pay to such  Lender on each  Interest  Payment  Date with  respect  to each
affected  Foreign  Currency Loan an amount that will  compensate such Lender for
such additional cost.

     (d) If any  Lender  becomes  entitled  to  claim  any  additional  amounts,
compensation  or additional  costs pursuant to this Section,  it shall deliver a
written notice in accordance with this paragraph to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Administrative  Agent) requesting such additional  amounts,  compensation or
additional  costs and  notifying the Borrower of the event by reason of which it
has become so entitled.  Such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to deliver
such notice  promptly  following the time at which it becomes aware of the event
giving rise to such additional amounts,  compensation or additional cost payable
(provided that the failure by such Lender to give such notice promptly shall not
adversely  affect  any  of  its  rights  hereunder).  A  certificate  as to  any
additional  amounts,  compensation  or  additional  costs  payable to any Lender
pursuant to this  Section 2.14  submitted by any Lender to the Borrower  (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in paragraphs (a), (b)
<PAGE>
                                       25

and (c)  above,  the  Borrower  shall not be  required  to  compensate  a Lender
pursuant to such  paragraphs  for any amounts  incurred  more than three  months
prior to the date  that such  Lender  notifies  the  Borrower  of such  Lender's
intention to claim  compensation  therefor;  and provided  further  that, if the
circumstances  giving rise to such claim have a  retroactive  effect,  then such
three-month  period shall be extended to include the period of such  retroactive
effect.  The  obligations  of the  Borrower  pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall
survive the  termination  of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

     (e)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement,  if (x) the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the  interpretation or
application thereof by a Governmental  Authority charged with the interpretation
or  administration  thereof  or  compliance  by any Lender  with any  request or
directive  (whether  or not  having the force of law) from any  central  bank or
other  Governmental  Authority made  subsequent to the date hereof shall make it
unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Foreign Currency Loan or to give
effect to its  obligations  as  contemplated  hereby with respect to any Foreign
Currency  Loan,  or (y) there  shall have  occurred  any change in  national  or
international  financial,   political  or  economic  conditions  (including  the
imposition  of or any change in  exchange  controls,  but  excluding  conditions
otherwise  covered by this Section 2.14) which would make it  impracticable  for
any  Lender  to make or  maintain  Foreign  Currency  Loans  denominated  in the
relevant  Foreign  Currency after the date hereof to, or for the account of, the
Borrower,  then,  by written  notice to the Borrower  and to the  Administrative
Agent:

          (i) such  Lender  may  declare  that  Foreign  Currency  Loans (in the
     affected  Foreign  Currency or  Currencies)  will not  thereafter  (for the
     duration  of such  unlawfulness  or change in  conditions)  be made by such
     Lender or  Lenders  hereunder  (or be  continued  for  additional  Interest
     Periods),  whereupon  any  request  for a  Foreign  Currency  Loan  (in the
     affected  Foreign Currency or Currencies) or to continue a Foreign Currency
     Loan (in the affected Foreign Currency or Currencies),  as the case may be,
     for an additional  Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be of no
     force and effect, unless such declaration shall be subsequently  withdrawn;
     and

          (ii) such Lender may require  that all  outstanding  Foreign  Currency
     Loans (in the  affected  Foreign  Currency  or  Currencies),  made by it be
     converted to ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, as the
     case may be  (unless  repaid  by the  Borrower),  in which  event  all such
     Foreign  Currency  Loans (in the affected  Foreign  Currency or Currencies)
     shall be  converted  to ABR  Loans or  Eurocurrency  Loans  denominated  in
     Dollars,  as the case may be, as of the  effective  date of such  notice as
     provided in  paragraph  (f) below and at the  Exchange  Rate on the date of
     such  conversion or, at the option of the Borrower,  repaid on the last day
     of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.

In the event any Lender shall  exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and  prepayments of principal made  thereafter that would otherwise
have been applied to repay the converted  Foreign  Currency Loans of such Lender
shall  instead  be  applied  to  repay  the  ABR  Loans  or  Eurocurrency  Loans
denominated in Dollars,  as the case may be, made by such Lender  resulting from
such conversion.
<PAGE>
                                       26

     (f) For purposes of Section 2.14(e), a notice to the Borrower by any Lender
shall be  effective  as to each Foreign  Currency  Loan made by such Lender,  if
lawful,  on the last day of the Interest  Period  currently  applicable  to such
Foreign  Currency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the
date of receipt thereof by the Borrower.

     2.15 Taxes.  (a) All  payments  made by the Borrower  under this  Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions or withholdings,  now or hereafter imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding
net income  taxes and  franchise  taxes  (imposed  in lieu of net income  taxes)
imposed  on the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or
former  connection  between  the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  and the
jurisdiction of the  Governmental  Authority  imposing such tax or any political
subdivision  or  taxing  authority  thereof  or  therein  (other  than  any such
connection  arising solely from the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced,  this Agreement or any other Loan Document).  If any such non-excluded
taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions or  withholdings
("Non-Excluded  Taxes") or Other  Taxes are  required  to be  withheld  from any
amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts
so payable to the Administrative  Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the
extent  necessary  to yield to the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender  (after
payment of all  Non-Excluded  Taxes and Other Taxes)  interest or any such other
amounts  payable  hereunder  at the rates or in the  amounts  specified  in this
Agreement,  provided,  however,  that the  Borrower  shall  not be  required  to
increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded
Taxes (i) that are  attributable  to such  Lender's  failure to comply  with the
requirements  of  paragraph  (d) or (e) of this  Section or (ii) that are United
States  withholding  taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time
such Lender  becomes a party to this  Agreement,  except to the extent that such
Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled,  at the time of assignment,  to receive
additional  amounts from the Borrower  with respect to such  Non-Excluded  Taxes
pursuant to this paragraph.

     (b) In  addition,  the  Borrower  shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c)  Whenever  any  Non-Excluded  Taxes or Other  Taxes are  payable by the
Borrower,  as promptly as possible  thereafter  the  Borrower  shall send to the
Administrative  Agent for its own  account or for the  account  of the  relevant
Lender,  as the case may be, a certified  copy of an original  official  receipt
received by the Borrower showing payment  thereof.  If the Borrower fails to pay
any  Non-Excluded  Taxes  or Other  Taxes  when  due to the  appropriate  taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other  required   documentary   evidence,   the  Borrower  shall  indemnify  the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  for any  incremental  taxes,  interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a
result of any such failure.

     (d) Each Lender (or Transferee)  that is not a "U.S.  Person" as defined in
Section  7701(a)(30)  of the Code (a  "Non-U.S.  Lender")  shall  deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant,  to the
Lender  from which the  related  participation  shall have been  purchased)  two
<PAGE>
                                       27

copies of either U.S.  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI,  or,
in  the  case  of  a  Non-U.S.  Lender  claiming  exemption  from  U.S.  federal
withholding  tax under  Section  871(h) or  881(c) of the Code with  respect  to
payments  of  "portfolio  interest",  a statement  substantially  in the form of
Exhibit E and a Form W-8BEN,  or any subsequent  versions  thereof or successors
thereto,  properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S.  Lender claiming
complete  exemption  from U.S.  federal  withholding  tax on all payments by the
Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Such forms shall be
delivered  by each  Non-U.S.  Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to
this Agreement (or, in the case of any  Participant,  on or before the date such
Participant  purchases the related  participation).  In addition,  each Non-U.S.
Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the  obsolescence or invalidity of
any form  previously  delivered  by such  Non-U.S.  Lender,  to the extent  such
Non-U.S.  Lender is  legally  able to  deliver  such  replacement  forms..  Each
Non-U.S.  Lender shall  promptly  notify the Borrower at any time it  determines
that  it  is no  longer  in a  position  to  provide  any  previously  delivered
certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of  certification  adopted by the
U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).

     (e) The  agreements in this Section shall survive the  termination  of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

     2.16  Indemnity.  The Borrower  agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to
hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain
or incur as a  consequence  of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing
of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has
given a notice  requesting  the same in accordance  with the  provisions of this
Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion
from  Eurocurrency  Loans  after  the  Borrower  has given a notice  thereof  in
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  or (c) the  making  of a
prepayment  of  Eurocurrency  Loans  on a day  that  is not the  last  day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the  excess,  if any,  of (i) the  amount of  interest  that would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid,  or not so borrowed,  converted or  continued,
for the period from the date of such  prepayment  or of such  failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of such Interest  Period (or, in the case of
a failure to borrow,  convert or continue,  the Interest  Period that would have
commenced on the date of such  failure) in each case at the  applicable  rate of
interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding,  however, the Applicable
Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount
by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable  period with leading banks in
the  interbank  Eurocurrency  market.  A certificate  as to any amounts  payable
pursuant  to this  Section  submitted  to the  Borrower  by any Lender  shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest  error.  This  covenant  shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

     2.17 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence
of any event  giving  rise to the  operation  of Section  2.14 or  2.15(a)  with
respect to such Lender,  it will, if requested by the Borrower,  use  reasonable
efforts (subject to overall policy  considerations  of such Lender) to designate
another  lending  office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of
avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made
on terms that,  in the sole  judgment of such Lender,  cause such Lender and its
lending   office(s)  to  suffer  no  economic,   legal,   regulatory   or  other
<PAGE>
                                       28

disadvantage,  and provided,  further, that nothing in this Section shall affect
or postpone any of the  obligations  of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender
pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15(a).

     2.18 Replacement of Lenders. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any
Lender that (a) requests  reimbursement  for amounts  owing  pursuant to Section
2.14 or 2.15(a) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder,  with
a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not
conflict  with any  Requirement  of Law,  (ii) no Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred and be continuing at the time of such  replacement,  (iii) prior to any
such  replacement,  such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.17 so
as to eliminate the continued  need for payment of any amounts owing pursuant to
Section  2.14 or  2.15(a),  (iv) the  replacement  financial  institution  shall
purchase,  at par (unless the Lender being replaced otherwise agrees to accept a
lesser  payment in its  discretion),  all Loans and other  amounts owing to such
replaced Lender on or prior to the date of  replacement,  (v) the Borrower shall
be liable to such replaced  Lender under Section 2.16 if any  Eurocurrency  Loan
owing to such replaced  Lender shall be purchased  other than on the last day of
the  Interest  Period   relating   thereto,   (vi)  the  replacement   financial
institution,  if not already a Lender,  shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the
Administrative  Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such
replacement in accordance  with the provisions of Section 9.6 (provided that the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay the  registration and processing fee referred
to therein),  (viii) until such time as such  replacement  shall be consummated,
the Borrower  shall pay all  additional  amounts (if any)  required  pursuant to
Section 2.14 or 2.15(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall
not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

     2.19 Judgment  Currency.  (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining  judgment in
any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into
another  currency,  each party hereto agrees,  to the fullest extent that it may
effectively  do so,  that the rate of exchange  used shall be that at which,  in
accordance  with normal  banking  procedures in the relevant  jurisdiction,  the
first  currency  could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

     (b) The  obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party
hereto  or any  holder  of the  obligations  owing  hereunder  (the  "Applicable
Creditor")  shall,  notwithstanding  any judgment in a currency  (the  "Judgment
Currency")  other  than the  currency  in which  such  sum is  stated  to be due
hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"),  be discharged only to the extent that, on
the  Business  Day  following  receipt  by the  Applicable  Creditor  of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,  the Applicable  Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant  jurisdiction purchase
the  Agreement  Currency  with  the  Judgment  Currency;  if the  amount  of the
Agreement  Currency  so  purchased  is less than the sum  originally  due to the
Applicable  Creditor  in the  Agreement  Currency,  the  Borrower  as a separate
obligation  and  notwithstanding  any such  judgment,  agrees to  indemnify  the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section shall survive the  termination of this Agreement and the payment
of all other amounts owing hereunder.

                    SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     To induce  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  to enter  into this
Agreement and to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby  represents and warrants to
the  Administrative  Agent  and each  Lender,  as of the date of this  Agreement
(except as to the  representations  and  warranties  made as of a date  certain,
which  shall be true  and  correct  as of such  date)  and as of the  date  such
representations and warranties are deemed to be made under Section 4.2(a), that:

     3.1 Financial  Condition.  The audited  consolidated  balance sheets of the
Borrower and its consolidated  Subsidiaries as at January 1, 2000,  December 30,
2000 and December 29, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income and
of cash flows for the  fiscal  years  ended on such  dates,  reported  on by and
accompanied by an unqualified  report from Arthur  Andersen LLP,  present fairly
the  consolidated  financial  condition  of the  Borrower  and its  consolidated
Subsidiaries as at such dates,  and the  consolidated  results of its operations
and its consolidated  cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The
unaudited  consolidated  balance  sheet  of the  Borrower  and its  consolidated
Subsidiaries  as at September 28, 2002, and the related  unaudited  consolidated
statements  of income and cash  flows for the  nine-month  period  ended on such
date,  present fairly the consolidated  financial  condition of the Borrower and
its consolidated  Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated  results of
its operations and its  consolidated  cash flows for the nine-month  period then
ended  (subject  to  normal  year-end  audit  adjustments).  All such  financial
statements,  including  the  related  schedules  and  notes  thereto,  have been
prepared in  accordance  with GAAP  (subject to the  absence of  footnotes  with
respect to unaudited quarterly  statements) applied consistently  throughout the
periods involved (except as approved by the  aforementioned  firm of accountants
and disclosed  therein).  As of the date of this Agreement,  no Group Member has
any material Guarantee  Obligations,  contingent liabilities and liabilities for
taxes,  or any  long-term  leases or unusual  forward or long-term  commitments,
including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange  transaction or
other  obligation in respect of  derivatives,  other than those that (i) are not
material  to the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  taken  as a whole or (ii) are
reflected in the most recent financial  statements referred to in this paragraph
or in the Borrower's most recent report on Form 10-K and any subsequent  reports
on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed with the SEC prior to the date of this  Agreement
(such filings,  the "SEC Filings").  During the period from December 29, 2001 to
and including the date of this  Agreement  there has been no  Disposition by any
Group  Member of any part of its  business or property  material to the Borrower
and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole  except as set forth in the most  recent
financial  statements  referred to in this  paragraph or in the  Borrower's  SEC
Filings.

     3.2 No Change.  Since  December 29, 2001,  there has been no development or
event that has had or could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse
Effect.

     3.3  Existence;  Compliance  with  Law.  Each  Group  Member  (a)  is  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal
right,  to own and operate its  property,  to lease the  property it operates as
lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign  corporation  and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership,  lease or operation of property or the conduct
of its business  requires such  qualification  and (d) is in compliance with all
<PAGE>
                                       30

Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to conform to the
requirements of clauses (a) through (d) could not, in the aggregate,  reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     3.4 Power;  Authorization;  Enforceable  Obligations.  The Borrower has the
power and authority,  and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan
Documents to which it is a party and to borrow hereunder. The Borrower has taken
all necessary  organizational  action to authorize the  execution,  delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the
Borrower,  to authorize the  extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.  No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other
act by or in  respect  of, any  Governmental  Authority  or any other  Person is
required of any Group Member in connection  with the  borrowings by the Borrower
hereunder or with the execution,  delivery and  performance by the Borrower,  or
the validity or enforceability against the Borrower, of this Agreement or any of
the Loan  Documents.  Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on
behalf of the Borrower. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document
upon execution will  constitute,  a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the
Borrower,  enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except
as  enforceability  may  be  limited  by  applicable   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,   moratorium  or  similar  laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of
creditors'  rights  generally  and  by  general  equitable  principles  (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

     3.5 No Legal Bar.  Except as, in the  aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be
expected  to  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect,  the  execution,  delivery  and
performance  of this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents,  the  borrowings
hereunder and the use of the proceeds  thereof will not violate any  Requirement
of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in,
or require,  the creation or imposition  of any Lien on any of their  respective
properties  or  revenues  pursuant  to  any  Requirement  of  Law  or  any  such
Contractual Obligation.

     3.6 Litigation. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator  or  Governmental  Authority  is pending or, to the  knowledge of the
Borrower,  threatened  by or against  any Group  Member or against  any of their
respective  properties or revenues  that could  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     3.7 Ownership of Property;  Liens.  Except as, in the aggregate,  could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  each Group Member has
title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property,
and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other property, and
none of such property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 6.4.

     3.8 Taxes. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  each  Group  Member has filed or caused to be
filed all Federal,  state and other material tax returns that are required to be
filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and  payable on said  returns or on
any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees
or  other  charges  imposed  on it or any of its  property  by any  Governmental
Authority  (other than any the amount or validity of which are  currently  being
contested  in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings  and with respect to which
reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant
Group Member).
<PAGE>
                                       31

     3.9 Federal Regulations.  No part of the proceeds of any Loans will be used
for any purpose that violates the provisions of Regulation U or any of the other
Regulations  of the Board.  If  requested  by any  Lender or the  Administrative
Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender a
statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form
G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U.

     3.10 ERISA.  Except as, in the aggregate,  could not reasonably be expected
to  have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect,   neither  a  Reportable  Event  nor  an
"accumulated  funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred  during the five-year  period prior to the
date on which this  representation  is made or deemed  made with  respect to any
Plan,  and each Plan has complied in all material  respects with the  applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination  of a Single  Employer Plan has
occurred that could  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,
and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has  arisen,  during  such  five-year
period.  The present value of all accrued  benefits  under each Single  Employer
Plan  (based on those  assumptions  used to fund such  Plans) did not, as of the
last annual  valuation  date prior to the date on which this  representation  is
made or deemed  made,  exceed the value of the assets of such Plan  allocable to
such accrued  benefits by an amount that is material in relation to Consolidated
Net Worth. Except as in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity
has had a complete  or  partial  withdrawal  from any  Multiemployer  Plan,  and
neither the Borrower nor any Commonly  Controlled Entity would become subject to
any liability under ERISA that, in the aggregate,  could  reasonably be expected
to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect if the  Borrower  or any such  Commonly
Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of
the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this  representation
is made or deemed  made.  No such  Multiemployer  Plan is in  Reorganization  or
Insolvent under  circumstances  that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

     3.11  Investment  Company Act;  Other  Regulations.  The Borrower is not an
"investment  company",  or a company  "controlled"  by an "investment  company",
within the  meaning of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended.  The
Borrower is not subject to regulation  under any  Requirement of Law (other than
Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

     3.12  Use of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds  of the  Loans  shall be used by the
Borrower and its  Subsidiaries for working  capital,  non-hostile  acquisitions,
repurchases of Capital Stock,  debentures and other  securities of the Borrower,
the refinancing of present and future debt and general corporate purposes.

     3.13  Environmental  Matters.  Except  as,  in  the  aggregate,  could  not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

     (a) the facilities and  properties  owned,  leased or operated by any Group
Member (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not previously contained, any
Materials  of  Environmental  Concern  in  amounts  or  concentrations  or under
circumstances  that constitute or constituted a violation of, or could give rise
to liability under, any Environmental Law;
<PAGE>
                                       32

     (b) no Group  Member has  received or is aware of any notice of  violation,
alleged violation,  non-compliance,  liability or potential  liability regarding
environmental  matters or compliance with  Environmental Laws with regard to any
of the Properties or the business operated by any Group Member (the "Business"),
nor does the Borrower  have  knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice
will be received or is being threatened;

     (c)  Materials  of  Environmental  Concern  have  not been  transported  or
disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location
that could give rise to liability  under,  any  Environmental  Law, nor have any
Materials of Environmental Concern been generated,  treated,  stored or disposed
of at, on or under any of the  Properties  in violation  of, or in a manner that
could give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law;

     (d) no judicial  proceeding or  governmental  or  administrative  action is
pending  or,  to  the   knowledge  of  the  Borrower,   threatened,   under  any
Environmental  Law to which any Group Member is or will be named as a party with
respect to the Properties or the Business,  nor are there any consent decrees or
other decrees,  consent orders,  administrative orders or other orders, or other
administrative or judicial requirements  outstanding under any Environmental Law
with respect to the Properties or the Business;

     (e)  there  has been no  release  or  threat of  release  of  Materials  of
Environmental  Concern at or from the Properties,  or arising from or related to
the  operations  of any  Group  Member  in  connection  with the  Properties  or
otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or in amounts or in a
manner that could give rise to liability under Environmental Laws;

     (f) the  Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance,
and  have in the  last  five  years  been in  compliance,  with  all  applicable
Environmental  Laws,  and  there is no  contamination  at,  under  or about  the
Properties or violation of any  Environmental Law with respect to the Properties
or the Business; and

     (g) no Group  Member has assumed any  liability  of any other  Person under
Environmental Laws.

     3.14 Accuracy of Information, etc. No statement or information contained in
this Agreement,  the Confidential  Information Memorandum or any other document,
certificate  or  statement  furnished  by or on  behalf of the  Borrower  to the
Administrative  Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, for use in connection with
the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement or the other Loan  Documents,
contained as of the date such  statement,  information,  document or certificate
was so furnished (or, in the case of the Confidential Information Memorandum, as
of the date of this  Agreement)  when taken  together with the SEC Filings,  any
untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or  omitted  to  state a  material  fact
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading. The
projections  and pro forma  financial  information  contained  in the  materials
referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by
management  of  the  Borrower  to be  reasonable  at the  time  made,  it  being
recognized  by the  Lenders  that such  financial  information  as it relates to
future  events is not to be viewed as fact and that  actual  results  during the
period or periods  covered by such  financial  information  may differ  from the
projected results set forth therein by a material amount.

ascertain  or to  inquire  as to the  observance  or  performance  of any of the
agreements  contained  in, or  conditions  of, this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.

     8.4 Reliance by  Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative  Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,  upon any instrument,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,  affidavit, letter, telecopy,
telex or teletype  message,  statement,  order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been  signed,  sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and  statements of legal counsel
(including counsel to the Borrower),  independent  accountants and other experts
selected by the  Administrative  Agent.  The  Administrative  Agent may deem and
treat the  payee of any Note as the  owner  thereof  for all  purposes  unless a
written  notice of assignment,  negotiation or transfer  thereof shall have been
filed with the  Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative  Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this  Agreement or any
other Loan Document  unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement,  all Lenders) as it
deems  appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction  by the
Lenders  against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully  protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents in accordance  with a request
of the Required  Lenders (or, if so specified by this  Agreement,  all Lenders),
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall
be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

     8.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the  occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless
the  Administrative  Agent has  received  notice  from a Lender or the  Borrower
referring  to this  Agreement,  describing  such Default or Event of Default and
stating  that such  notice  is a  "notice  of  default".  In the event  that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Lenders.  The Administrative  Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed
by the Required  Lenders (or, if so specified by this  Agreement,  all Lenders);
provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such
directions,  the  Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of  Default  as it shall  deem  advisable  in the  best  interests  of the
Lenders.

     8.6  Non-Reliance  on  Agents  and Other  Lenders.  Each  Lender  expressly
acknowledges  that  neither  the  Agents nor any of their  respective  officers,
directors,  employees,  agents,  attorneys-in-fact  or affiliates  have made any
representations  or  warranties  to it and  that no act by any  Agent  hereafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a
Loan Party,  shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any
Agent  to any  Lender.  Each  Lender  represents  to the  Agents  that  it  has,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based
on such  documents and  information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own
appraisal  of  and  investigation  into  the  business,  operations,   property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans  hereunder and enter into
this  Agreement.  Each Lender also represents  that it will,  independently  and
<PAGE>
                                       46

without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its
own credit  analysis,  appraisals  and  decisions in taking or not taking action
under  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan   Documents,   and  to  make  such
investigation  as it  deems  necessary  to  inform  itself  as to the  business,
operations,  property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Loan  Parties  and their  affiliates.  Except  for  notices,  reports  and other
documents   expressly   required  to  be   furnished   to  the  Lenders  by  the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or  responsibility  to provide any Lender  with any credit or other  information
concerning  the  business,   operations,   property,   condition  (financial  or
otherwise),  prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the  possession of the  Administrative  Agent or
any  of  its  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,   attorneys-in-fact  or
affiliates.

     8.7  Indemnification.  The  Lenders  agree to  indemnify  each Agent in its
capacity  as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by the  Borrower  and  without
limiting the  obligation of the Borrower to do so),  ratably  according to their
respective Loan  Percentages in effect on the date on which  indemnification  is
sought under this Section (or, if  indemnification is sought after the date upon
which the  Commitments  shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid
in full,  ratably in accordance with such Loan Percentages  immediately prior to
such  date),  from and  against any and all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment
of the Loans) be imposed on,  incurred by or asserted  against such Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments,  this Agreement,  any of the
other Loan Documents or any documents  contemplated  by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or any action taken
or omitted  by such  Agent  under or in  connection  with any of the  foregoing;
provided  that no Lender  shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or  disbursements  that are found by a final and  nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's
gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  The  agreements in this Section shall
survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

     8.8 Agent in Its  Individual  Capacity.  Each Agent and its  affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent.  With respect to its
Loans made or renewed by it,  each Agent  shall have the same  rights and powers
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not an Agent,  and the terms  "Lender" and  "Lenders"
shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

     8.9 Successor  Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as
Administrative  Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and the  Borrower.  If
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  resign as  Administrative  Agent  under  this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  then the Required Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders,  which successor agent
shall  (unless  an Event of Default  under  Section  7(a) or  Section  7(f) with
respect to the Borrower  shall have  occurred and be  continuing)  be subject to
approval by the Borrower (which  approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld or
delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
<PAGE>
                                       47

duties of the Administrative  Agent, and the term  "Administrative  Agent" shall
mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval,  and the
former Administrative  Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be  terminated,  without  any other or further  act or deed on the part of
such former  Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders  of the  Loans.  If no  successor  agent  has  accepted  appointment  as
Administrative  Agent  by  the  date  that  is  10  days  following  a  retiring
Administrative  Agent's  notice  of  resignation,  the  retiring  Administrative
Agent's  resignation  shall  nevertheless  thereupon become  effective,  and the
Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder  until such time, if any, as the Required  Lenders appoint a successor
agent  as  provided  for  above.  After  any  retiring   Administrative  Agent's
resignation  as  Administrative  Agent,  the  provisions of this Section 8 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     8.10 Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents. Neither the Syndication
Agent nor any  Co-Documentation  Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities
hereunder in its capacity as such.

                            SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

     9.1  Amendments  and  Waivers.  Neither  this  Agreement,  any  other  Loan
Document,  nor any terms  hereof or  thereof  may be  amended,  supplemented  or
modified  except in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Section 9.1. The
Required  Lenders and the  Borrower  may,  or,  with the written  consent of the
Required Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower may, from time to
time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and
to the other Loan  Documents  for the purpose of adding any  provisions  to this
Agreement  or the other Loan  Documents  or changing in any manner the rights of
the Lenders or the Borrower  hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms
and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative  Agent, as the case
may  be,  may  specify  in  such  instrument,  any of the  requirements  of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its
consequences;  provided,  however,  that no such  waiver and no such  amendment,
supplement or modification  shall (i) forgive the principal amount or extend the
final  scheduled  date of  maturity  of any Loan,  reduce the stated rate of any
interest  or fee  payable  hereunder  (except in  connection  with the waiver of
applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall
be effective with the consent of the Required  Lenders)) or extend the scheduled
date of any payment  thereof,  or increase  the amount or extend the  expiration
date of any Lender's  Commitment,  in each case  without the written  consent of
each Lender  directly  affected  thereby;  (ii)  eliminate  or reduce the voting
rights of any Lender under this Section 9.1 without the written  consent of such
Lender;  (iii) reduce any  percentage  specified in the  definition  of Required
Lenders or consent to the  assignment  or transfer by the Borrower of any of its
rights and  obligations  under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,  in
each case  without the written  consent of all  Lenders;  (iv) amend,  modify or
waive  any   provision  of  Section  9  without  the  written   consent  of  the
Administrative  Agent; or (v) add additional currencies as Foreign Currencies in
which  Foreign  Currency  Loans may be made under  this  Agreement  without  the
written  consent of all the  Lenders.  Any such  waiver and any such  amendment,
supplement or modification  shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall
be binding upon the  Borrower,  the Lenders,  the  Administrative  Agent and all
future  holders of the  Loans.  In the case of any  waiver,  the  Borrower,  the
<PAGE>
                                       48

Lenders and the Administrative  Agent shall be restored to their former position
and rights  hereunder  and under the other Loan  Documents,  and any  Default or
Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not  continuing;  but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default,
or impair any right consequent thereon.

     9.2 Notices.  All notices,  requests and demands to or upon the  respective
parties hereto to be effective  shall be in writing  (including by telecopy) and

Administrative  Agent  pursuant  to the final  paragraph  of  Section 7 shall be
deemed to have been duly given or made when  delivered,  or three  Business Days

     9.3 No Waiver;  Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in
exercising,  on the part of the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender, any right,
remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder or under the other Loan  Documents  shall
operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
right,  remedy,  power or  privilege  hereunder  preclude  any other or  further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     9.4 Survival of Representations  and Warranties.  All  representations  and
warranties  made  hereunder,  in the other Loan  Documents  and in any document,

     9.5  Payment of  Expenses  and  Taxes.  The  Borrower  agrees (a) to pay or
reimburse the Administrative  Agent for all its reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs
and  expenses  incurred in  connection  with the  development,  preparation  and
execution of, and any amendment,  supplement or modification  to, this Agreement
and the other Loan  Documents  and any other  documents  prepared in  connection
herewith  or  therewith,   and  the  consummation  and   administration  of  the

disbursements  of counsel to the  Administrative  Agent,  with  statements  with

Date (in the case of  amounts to be paid on the  Closing  Date) and from time to
time  thereafter  on a  quarterly  basis  or such  other  periodic  basis as the
Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) after the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default,  to pay or reimburse each Lender and the
Administrative  Agent for all its  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses
incurred in connection  with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including
the fees and  disbursements  of  counsel  to each  Lender  and of counsel to the
Administrative  Agent and (c) to pay,  indemnify,  and hold each  Lender and the
Administrative  Agent  and  their  respective  officers,  directors,  employees,
affiliates, agents and controlling persons (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from
and  against  any and  all  other  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature  whatsoever  (including  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
with  respect  to such  Lender  or  Administrative  Agent  being a party to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document,  or the enforcement or performance of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents,  including any
of the  foregoing  relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation
of,  noncompliance  with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to
the operations of any Group Member or any of the  Properties  (all the foregoing
in this clause (c), collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), provided, that
the Borrower shall have no obligation  hereunder to any Indemnitee  with respect
to Indemnified  Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found
by a final and  nonappealable  decision of a court of competent  jurisdiction to
have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee
or the  breach by such  Indemnitee  of its  obligations  under  this  Agreement.
Without  limiting the foregoing,  and to the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its  Subsidiaries  not to assert,
and hereby waives and agrees to cause its  Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for
contribution  or any other  rights  of  recovery  with  respect  to all  claims,
demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses
of whatever kind or nature,  under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of
<PAGE>
                                       50
them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee.  All amounts due
under this  Section  9.5 shall be payable  not later than 10 days after  written
demand therefor. Statements payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.5
shall be  submitted  to Office  of the  General  Counsel  (Telephone  No.  (781)
622-1000)  (Telecopy  No.  (781)  622-1283),  at the address of the Borrower set
forth in Section  9.2,  or to such other  Person or address as may be  hereafter
designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative  Agent. The
agreements  in this  Section 9.5 shall  survive  repayment  of the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

     9.6  Successors  and  Assigns;  Participations  and  Assignments.  (a)  The
provisions of this  Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
except that (i) the  Borrower  may not assign or  otherwise  transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
(and any attempted  assignment or transfer by the Borrower  without such consent
shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise  transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.

     (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any
Lender  may  assign to one or more  assignees  (each,  an  "Assignee")  all or a
portion of its rights and obligations  under this Agreement  (including all or a
portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

          (A)  the Borrower,  provided that no consent of the Borrower  shall be
               required  for an  assignment  to a  Lender,  or,  if an  Event of
               Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and

          (B)  the  Administrative  Agent,  provided  that  no  consent  of  the
               Administrative  Agent shall be required for an  assignment of any
               Commitment  to an  assignee  that is a Lender  with a  Commitment
               immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

         (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

          (A)  except in the case of an assignment to a Lender,  an affiliate of
               a Lender  or an  Approved  Fund or an  assignment  of the  entire
               remaining amount of the assigning Lender's  Commitments or Loans,
               the amount of the  Commitments  or Loans of the assigning  Lender
               subject to each such  assignment  (determined  as of the date the
               Assignment  and  Assumption  with respect to such  assignment  is
               delivered  to the  Administrative  Agent)  shall not be less than
               $5,000,000  unless each of the  Borrower  and the  Administrative
               Agent otherwise consent, provided that (1) no such consent of the
               Borrower  shall be required  if an Event of Default has  occurred
               and is  continuing  and (2) such amounts  shall be  aggregated in
               respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved  Funds,  if
               any;


<PAGE>
                                       51

          (B)  the parties to each  assignment  shall execute and deliver to the
               Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,  together with
               a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

          (C)  the Assignee,  if it shall not be a Lender,  shall deliver to the
               Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire.

     For the  purposes of this Section  9.6,  the term  "Approved  Fund" has the
following meaning:

     "Approved  Fund"  means any Person  (other than a natural  person)  that is
engaged in making,  purchasing,  holding or  investing in bank loans and similar
extensions  of  credit  in the  ordinary  course  of its  business  and  that is
administered or managed by (a) a Lender,  (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an
entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

     (iii) Subject to acceptance  and  recording  thereof  pursuant to paragraph
(b)(iv) below,  from and after the effective  date specified in each  Assignment
and  Assumption  the  Assignee  thereunder  shall be a party  hereto and, to the
extent of the interest  assigned by such  Assignment  and  Assumption,  have the
rights and  obligations  of a Lender  under this  Agreement,  and the  assigning
Lender  thereunder  shall,  to the  extent  of the  interest  assigned  by  such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption  covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall  continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14,  2.15,  2.16 and 9.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations  under this  Agreement  that does not comply  with this  Section 9.6
shall be treated for  purposes of this  Agreement  as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section.

     (iv) The Administrative  Agent,  acting for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower,  shall  maintain at one of its offices a copy of each  Assignment  and
Assumption  delivered to it and a register for the  recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders,  and the Commitments  of, and principal  amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender  pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
"Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower,
the  Administrative  Agent,  and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.

     (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed
by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed  administrative
questionnaire  (unless the Assignee  shall already be a Lender  hereunder),  the
processing and  recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and
any  written  consent  to such  assignment  required  by  paragraph  (b) of this
Section,  the  Administrative  Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
and record the  information  contained  therein in the  Register.  No assignment
<PAGE>
                                       52

shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.

     (c)  (i) Any  Lender  may,  without  the  consent  of the  Borrower  or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a  "Participant")  in all or a portion of such Lender's  rights and obligations
under this  Agreement  (including  all or a portion of its  Commitments  and the
Loans  owing to it);  provided  that (A) such  Lender's  obligations  under this
Agreement  shall  remain   unchanged,   (B)  such  Lender  shall  remain  solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such  obligations
and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other
Lenders  shall  continue  to deal  solely  and  directly  with  such  Lender  in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations  under this Agreement.  Any
agreement  pursuant to which a Lender sells such a  participation  shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce  this  Agreement  and to
approve  any  amendment,  modification  or  waiver  of  any  provision  of  this
Agreement;  provided that such  agreement may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,  modification or
waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender  directly  affected  thereby
pursuant to the proviso to the second  sentence of Section 9.1 and (2)  directly
affects such  Participant.  Subject to paragraph  (c)(ii) of this  Section,  the
Borrower  agrees that each  Participant  shall be  entitled  to the  benefits of
Sections  2.14,  2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by  assignment  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
To the extent  permitted by law, each  Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
shall be subject to Section 9.7(a) as though it were a Lender.

          (ii) A  Participant  shall not be entitled  to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.15 than the  applicable  Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation  sold to such
Participant,  unless the sale of the  participation  to such  Participant is
made with the Borrower's prior written consent.  Any Participant  that is a
Non-U.S.  Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless
such  Participant  complies with Section 2.15(d).

     (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure  obligations of such
Lender,  including any pledge or assignment to secure  obligations  to a Federal
Reserve Bank,  and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment
of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest  shall  release  a Lender  from  any of its  obligations  hereunder  or
substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     (e) The Borrower,  upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender,
agrees to issue Notes to any Lender  requiring Notes to facilitate  transactions
of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

     (f)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any Lender may assign its rights and
obligations  to a Conduit  Lender  organized  and  administered  by such Lender,
provided that such  assignment  shall be subject to all the  requirements of the
definition  of the term  "Conduit  Lender" in Section 1.1.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  any  Conduit  Lender  may assign any or all of the Loans it may have
funded  hereunder to its designating  Lender without the consent of the Borrower
<PAGE>
                                       53
or the  Administrative  Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.6(b). Each of the Borrower,  each Lender and the Administrative  Agent
hereby confirms that it will not institute  against a Conduit Lender or join any
other  Person  in  instituting   against  a  Conduit   Lender  any   bankruptcy,
reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency or  liquidation  proceeding  under any
state  bankruptcy  or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in
full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender;
provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees
to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost,
damage or expense  arising out of its  inability to institute  such a proceeding
against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.

     9.7  Adjustments;  Set-off.  (a) Except to the extent  that this  Agreement
expressly  provides for payments to be allocated to a particular  Lender, if any
Lender (a  "Benefitted  Lender") shall receive any payment of all or part of the
Obligations  owing to it  (whether  voluntarily  or  involuntarily,  by set-off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature  referred to in Section 7(f), or
otherwise),  in a greater  proportion  than any such  payment  to or  collateral
received by any other  Lender,  if any, in respect of the  Obligations  owing to
such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other
Lenders a  participating  interest in such portion of the  Obligations  owing to
each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of
any such  collateral,  as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted  Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the
Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or
benefits is thereafter  recovered  from such  Benefitted  Lender,  such purchase
shall be rescinded,  and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest.

     (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders  provided by law,
each  Lender  shall  have  the  right  after  the   occurrence  and  during  the
continuation of an Event of Default,  without prior notice to the Borrower,  any
such notice being  expressly  waived by the Borrower to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law,  upon any  amount  becoming  due and  payable  by the  Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set
off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits  (general
or special,  time or demand,  provisional  or final),  in any currency,  and any
other credits,  indebtedness  or claims,  in any currency,  in each case whether
direct or indirect,  absolute or contingent,  matured or unmatured,  at any time
held or owing by such  Lender  or any  branch or  agency  thereof  to or for the
credit or the account of the  Borrower,  as the case may be. Each Lender  agrees
promptly  to notify the  Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent after any such
setoff and  application  made by such Lender,  provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

     9.8  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed by one or more of the
parties to this  Agreement  on any number of separate  counterparts,  and all of
said counterparts  taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument.  Delivery  of an  executed  signature  page  of  this  Agreement  by
facsimile  transmission  shall be effective  as delivery of a manually  executed
counterpart  hereof.  A set of the  copies of this  Agreement  signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                                       54

     9.9  Severability.  Any provision of this  Agreement  that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability  without  invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render  unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     9.10 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the
entire agreement of the Borrower,  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with
respect to the subject  matter  hereof and  thereof,  and there are no promises,
undertakings,  representations or warranties by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender  relative to the subject  matter  hereof not  expressly  set
forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

     9.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     9.12 Submission To Jurisdiction;  Waivers.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally:

     (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal  action or  proceeding
relating to this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party,
or for recognition and  enforcement of any judgment in respect  thereof,  to the
non-exclusive  general  jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the
courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and appellate
courts from any thereof;

     (b)  consents  that any such  action or  proceeding  may be brought in such
courts and waives any objection  that it may now or hereafter  have to the venue
of any such  action  or  proceeding  in any such  court or that  such  action or
proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

     (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding  may be
effected  by mailing a copy  thereof by  registered  or  certified  mail (or any
substantially  similar form of mail),  postage  prepaid,  to the Borrower at its
address  set  forth  in  Section  9.2 or at such  other  address  of  which  the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

     (d) agrees that nothing  herein shall affect the right to effect service of
process in any other manner  permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in
any other jurisdiction; and

     (e) waives,  to the maximum  extent not prohibited by law, any right it may
have to claim or recover in any legal action or  proceeding  referred to in this
Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

     9.13    Acknowledgements.    The   Borrower   hereby   acknowledges   that:

     (a) it has been  advised  by  counsel  in the  negotiation,  execution  and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
<PAGE>
                                       55

     (b)  neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any Lender  has any  fiduciary
relationship  with or duty to the Borrower  arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,  and the relationship between
Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and Holdings and the Borrower, on
the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and
creditor; and

     (c) no joint  venture is created  hereby or by the other Loan  Documents or
otherwise  exists by virtue of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby among the
Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

     9.14  Confidentiality.  Each of the  Administrative  Agent and each  Lender
agrees  on its own  behalf  and on  behalf  of each  Affiliate  thereof  to keep
confidential all non-public  information provided to it by any Group Member, the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender  pursuant  to or in  connection  with  this
Agreement that is designated by the provider thereof as  confidential;  provided
that nothing  herein shall prevent the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender from
disclosing  any such  information  (a) to the  Administrative  Agent,  any other
Lender or any  affiliate  thereof  solely for the  purposes  of, or otherwise in
connection with, this Agreement, (b) subject to an express agreement to maintain
the  confidentiality  of such  information in compliance  with the provisions of
this  Section  (which may be a standing  agreement  between such Lender and such
Transferee),  to any actual or prospective  Transferee or any direct or indirect
counterparty  to any  Swap  Agreement  (or  any  professional  advisor  to  such
counterparty),  (c) to its employees, directors, agents, attorneys,  accountants
and other professional advisors or those of any of its affiliates,  in each case
who have a need to know such  information in accordance with customary  business
practices (it being  understood  that the Person to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the  confidential  nature of such information and instructed
to keep such  information  confidential),  (d) upon the request or demand of any
Governmental  Authority,  (e) in  response  to any  order of any  court or other
Governmental  Authority  or  as  may  otherwise  be  required  pursuant  to  any
Requirement  of Law, (f) if required to do so in connection  with any litigation
or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National
Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  or any  similar  organization  or any
nationally  recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a
Lender's investment  portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to
such Lender,  or (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy  hereunder or
under any other Loan Document.  Unless specifically prohibited by applicable law
or court order,  the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender shall,  prior to any
disclosure under clause (d), (e) or (f) above to (x) any Governmental  Authority
that does not have  supervisory,  regulatory  or other  similar  authority  with
respect to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and that
is  seeking  such  disclosure   solely  in  connection  with  an  investigation,
litigation   or  other   proceeding   that  does  not   otherwise   involve  the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, or (y) any other Person
that is not a  Governmental  Entity,  notify the Borrower of any request for the
disclosure of any such non-public information so as to provide the Borrower with
the  reasonable  opportunity  to obtain a protective  order or other  comparable
relief.
