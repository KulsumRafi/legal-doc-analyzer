claim under this Agreement (the "Claimant') in writing, within 90 days of
Claimant's written application for benefits, of his or her eligibility or
ineligibility for benefits under this Agreement. If Bank determines that the
Claimant is not eligible for benefits or full benefits, the notice shall set

up to an additional 90 days.

eligible for benefits, or if the Claimant believes that he or she is entitled to
greater or different benefits, the Claimant shall have the opportunity to have
such claim reviewed by Bank by filing a petition for review with Bank within 60
days after receipt of the notice issued by Bank. Said petition shall state the
specific reasons which the Claimant believes entitle him or her to benefits or
to greater or different benefits. Within 60 days after receipt by Bank of the
petition, Bank shall afford the Claimant (and counsel, if any) an opportunity to
present his or her position to Bank verbally or in writing, and the Claimant (or
counsel) shall have the right to review the pertinent documents. Bank shall
notify the Claimant of its decision in writing within the sixty-day period,
stating specifically the basis of its decision, referencing the specific
provisions of this Agreement on which the decision is based. If, because of the
need for a hearing, the 60-day period is not sufficient, the decision may be
deferred for up to another 60-day period at the election of Bank, but notice of
this deferral shall be given to the Claimant.

                               General Limitations

      10.1 Excess Parachute or Golden Parachute Payment. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any benefit provided under this
Agreement, when added to all other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf
of Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in
the imposition of an excise tax under Code Section 4999, such payments shall be
retroactively (if necessary) reduced to the extent necessary to avoid such
excise tax imposition or shall be forfeited to the extent the benefit would be a
prohibited golden parachute payment pursuant to 12 C.F.R. ss.359.2 and for which
the appropriate federal banking agency has not given written consent to pay
pursuant to 12 C.F.R. ss.359.4. Upon written notice to Executive, together with
calculations of Bank's independent auditors, Executive shall remit to Bank the
amount of the reduction plus such interest as may be necessary to avoid the
imposition of such excise tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this contract to the contrary, if any portion of the amount herein
payable to the Executive is determined to be non-deductible pursuant to the

as amended (the "Code"), the Corporation shall be required only to pay to
Executive the amount determined to be deductible under Section 280G.

      10.2 Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the benefit provided under this Agreement shall be
forfeited if Bank terminates Executive's employment for:

            (A)   Executive's conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere
                  to a felony, a crime of falsehood or a crime involving moral
                  turpitude, or the actual incarceration of Executive for a
                  period of thirty (30) consecutive days or more;

            (B)   Executive's failure to follow the good faith lawful
                  instructions of the Board of Directors of Bank with respect to
                  its operations, after written notice from Bank and a failure
                  to cure such violation within sixty (60) days of said written
                  notice;

            (C)   Executive's willful failure to substantially perform
                  Executive's duties for Bank, other than a failure resulting
                  from Executive's incapacity because of physical or mental
                  illness, as provided in subsection (d) of this Section 4,
                  after written notice from Bank and a failure to cure such
                  violation within sixty (60) days of said written notice;

            (D)   Executive's intentional violation of the provisions of this
                  Agreement, after written notice from Bank and a failure to
                  cure such violation within sixty

            (E)   dishonesty of Executive in the performance of his duties;

            (F)   gross misconduct on the part of Executive as determined by an
                  affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of the disinterested
                  members of the Board of Directors which brings public
                  discredit to Bank;

            (G)   Executive's breach of fiduciary duty involving personal
                  profit; or

            (H)   Executive's willful violation of any law, rule or regulation
                  governing banks or bank officers or any final cease and desist
                  order issued by a bank regulatory authority, unless

                  Directors.

      10.3 Removal. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Bank shall not pay any benefit under this Agreement if Executive is
subject to a final removal or prohibition order issued by an appropriate federal
banking agency pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

            10.4.2  Judicial Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened
                    breach by Executive of any provision of these restrictions,
                    Executive recognizes the substantial and immediate harm that
                    a breach or threatened breach will impose upon Bank or any
                    of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, and further recognizes
                    that in such event monetary damages may be inadequate to
                    fully protect Bank or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates.
                    Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach
                    of this Agreement, Executive consents to Bank's or any of
                    its subsidiaries or Affiliates' entitlement to such
                    preliminary, interlocutory, temporary or permanent
                    injunctive, or any other equitable relief, protecting and
                    fully enforcing Bank's or any of its subsidiaries or
                    Affiliates' rights hereunder and preventing Executive from
                    further breaching any of his obligations set forth herein.
                    Executive expressly waives any requirement, based on any
                    statute, rule of procedure, or other source, that Bank or
                    any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates post a bond as a
                    condition of obtaining any of the above-described remedies.
                    Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting Bank or any
                    of its subsidiaries or Affiliates from pursuing any other
                    remedies available to Bank or any of its subsidiaries or
                    Affiliates at law or in equity for such breach or threatened
                    breach, including the recovery of damages from Executive.
                    Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the
                    restrictions set forth in Section 10.4.1 are reasonable, in
                    terms of scope, duration, geographic area, and otherwise,
                    (ii) the protections afforded Bank or any of its
                    subsidiaries or Affiliates in Section 10.4.1 are necessary
                    to protect its legitimate business interest, (iii) the
                    restrictions set forth in Section 10.4.1 will not be
                    materially adverse to Executive's employment with Bank, and
                    (iv) his agreement to observe such restrictions



<PAGE>

                    forms a material part of the consideration for this
                    Agreement.

            10.4.3  Overbreadth of Restrictive Covenant. It is expressly
                    understood and agreedthat, although Executive and Bank
                    consider the restrictions contained in Section 10.4.1 hereof
                    reasonable for the purpose of preserving for Bank its good
                    will and other proprietary rights, if a final judicial
                    determination is made by a court having jurisdiction that
                    the time or territory or any other restriction contained in
                    Section 10.4.1 hereof is an unreasonable or otherwise
                    unenforceable restriction against Executive, the provisions
                    of Section 10.4.1 hereof shall not be rendered void but
                    shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and
                    territory and to such other extent as such court may
                    judicially determine or indicate to be reasonable.

            10.4.4  Change of Control. This Section 10.4 shall not apply if
                    there is a Change of Control.

      10.5 Suicide or Misstatement. If Executive commits suicide within two (2)
years after the date of this Agreement, or if the Insurer denies coverage for
material misstatements of fact made by Executive on any application for life
insurance purchased by Bank, or any other reason, provided however that Bank
shall evaluate the reason for the denial, and upon advice of Counsel and in its
sole discretion, consider judicially challenging any denial.

their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, administrators and transferees, and
any Policy beneficiary.

Agreement executed by Executive and Bank on or about April 12, 2001 or any other
employment agreement that Executive and Bank have executed or may execute in the
future, except as specifically stated in this Agreement. It does not give
Executive the right to remain an employee of Bank, nor does it interfere with
Bank's right to discharge Executive. It also does not require Executive to
remain an employee nor interfere with Executive's right to terminate employment
at any time.

      11.3 Applicable Law. The Agreement and all rights hereunder shall be
governed by and construed according to the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, except to the extent preempted by the laws of the United States of

the obligations of Bank.

      11.5 Notice. Any notice, consent or demand required or permitted to be
given under the provisions of this Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
Agreement by one party to another shall be in writing, shall be signed by the
party giving or making the same, and may be given either by delivering the same
to such other party personally, or by mailing the same, by United States
certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party, addressed to his or her last
known address as shown on the records of Bank. The date of such mailing shall be
deemed the date of such mailed notice, consent or demand.

      11.6 Recovery of Estate Taxes. If Executive's gross estate for federal
estate tax purposes includes any amount determined by reference to and on
account of this Agreement, and if the beneficiary is other than Executive's
estate, then Executive's estate shall be entitled to recover from the
beneficiary receiving such benefit under the terms of the Agreement, an amount
by which the total estate tax due by Executive's estate, exceeds the total
estate tax which would have been payable if the value of such benefit had not
been included in Executive's gross estate. If there is more than one person
receiving such benefit, the right of recovery shall be against each such person.
In the event the beneficiary has a liability hereunder, the beneficiary may
petition Bank for a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed the
beneficiary's liability hereunder.

      11.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between Bank and Executive as to the subject matter hereof. No rights are
granted to Executive by virtue of this Agreement other than those specifically
set forth herein.

            (d)   Establishing rules and prescribing any forms necessary or
                  desirable to administer the Agreement.

      11.9 Named Fiduciary. Bank shall be the named fiduciary and plan
administrator under the Agreement. The named fiduciary may delegate to others
certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the plan
including the employment of advisors and the delegation of ministerial duties to
qualified individuals.
