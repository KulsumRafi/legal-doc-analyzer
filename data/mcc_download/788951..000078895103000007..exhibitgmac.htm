The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Note, the Security Documents, and the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby are within the corporate power and authority of the Borrower and have been authorized by all necessary corporate proceedings, and do not and will not (a) require any consent or approval of the stockholders of the Borrower, (b) contravene any provision of the charter documents or by-laws of the Borrower or any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower, (c) contravene any provision of, or constitute an event of default or event that, but for the requirement that time elapse or notice be given, or both, would constitute an event of default under, any other agreement, instrument, order or undertaking binding on the Borrower, or (d) result in or require the imposition of any Encumbrance on any of the properties, assets or rights of the Borrower except for the Encumbrances in favor of Lender created by the Security Documents.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Consents or Approvals</U>. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Note, the Security Documents, and the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated herein do not require any approval or consent of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or other agency or authority, or any other party (except for the filing of UCC-1 financing statements and the recording of the Real Property Security Instrument).</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Title to Properties; Absence of Encumbrances</U>. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of the properties, assets and rights of every name and nature now purported to be owned by it, including, without limitation, such properties, assets and rights as are reflected in the financial statements referred to in Section 4.6 (except such properties, assets or rights as have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date thereof), free from all defects of title that might materially adversely affect such properties, assets or rights, taken as a whole. The Collateral is free from all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.  </LI></P>

There are no liabilities, contingent or otherwise, not disclosed in such financial statements, except for those arising in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2002, none of which, individually or in the aggregate have had a Material Adverse Effect, and except for those, whether or not so arising, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.</LI></P>

Except as set forth on <U>Exhibit C</U> hereto, there is no litigation, arbitration, proceeding or investigation pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's officers, threatened, against the Borrower or any Subsidiary.  None of the litigation set forth on <U>Exhibit C</U> hereto, if adversely determined, could result in a material judgment not fully covered by insurance, could result in a forfeiture of all or any substantial part of the property of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, or could otherwise reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Use of Proceeds</U>. No portion of any Loan is to be used for the &quot;purpose of purchasing or carrying&quot; any &quot;margin stock&quot; as such terms are used in Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.P.R. 221 and 224, as amended.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Burdensome Obligations</U>.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any franchise, agreement, deed, lease or other instrument, or subject to any charter, by-law or other restriction which is so unusual or burdensome that it may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower does not presently anticipate that future expenditures needed to meet the provisions of federal or state statutes, orders, rules or regulations will be so burdensome as to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind (whether fixed, accrued, contingent, unmatured or otherwise) which may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Labor Matters</U>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the other Loan Documents are hereby made part of this Note to the same extent and with the same force as if they were fully set forth in this Note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note may not be modified, amended, waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any act or failure to act on the part of Borrower or Lender, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any modification, amendment, waiver, extension, change, discharge or termination is sought.</P>
