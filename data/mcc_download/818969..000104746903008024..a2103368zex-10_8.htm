<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between Provident Bank of Maryland, a Maryland corporation ("Provident") and Peter M. Martin ("Executive"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement's purpose is to provide certain supplemental retirement and death benefits to the Executive and his surviving spouse in consideration of his services to
Provident. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement has been approved on Provident's behalf by resolution of the Compensation Committee of Provident's Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, Provident and the Executive agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Retirement Income</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning at the Executive's Termination Date, Provident
shall pay to the Executive a monthly benefit (the "Supplemental Benefit") for the Executive's life equal to: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70%
of the Executive's Final Salary, reduced by both his Social Security Benefit and his highest monthly age 65 benefit accrued under the Provident Pension Plan; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplied
by the ratio (not to exceed 1)&nbsp;of his years (and any fractional year) of employment by Provident over 25&nbsp;years. </FONT></P>

</UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
monthly Supplemental Benefit payment (whether payable before or after his Normal Retirement Date) is to be reduced by 3% for each full year (with a proportionate reduction for any
partial year) by which Executive's Termination Date precedes his Normal Retirement Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Spouse's Death Benefit</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Executive dies after his 55<SUP>th</SUP> birthday and before he has received 180&nbsp;monthly Supplemental Benefit payments, Provident shall pay to his surviving spouse a
monthly Spouse's Benefit beginning at the Executive's death and continuing until the earlier of the surviving spouse's death or until the combined number of monthly payments under this Agreement
received by the Executive and his spouse equals 180. Each monthly Spouse's Benefit payment is to be equal to the Supplemental Benefit payment that the Executive would have received if he were still
living at the date that spouse's payment is to be made and, where the Executive dies without having received any Supplemental Benefits, determined as if his Supplemental Benefits began on the date of
his death. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Funding</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provident's obligations under this Agreement shall not be secured in
any manner. No asset of Provident shall be placed in trust or in escrow or otherwise physically or legally segregated for the benefit of the Executive or his spouse, and the eventual payment of the
payments described in this Agreement to the Executive, his spouse or any other person shall not be secured to him or them by the issuance of any negotiable instrument or other evidence of indebtedness
of Provident. Neither the Executive, his spouse, nor any other person shall be deemed to have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific asset of Provident, and, to the extent that any
person acquires any right to receive payments under this Agreement, that right shall be no greater than, nor shall it have any preference or priority over, the rights of any unsecured general creditor
of Provident. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Assignment</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payments, benefits or rights under this Agreement shall be
subject in any manner to anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, charge or alienation by the Executive, his spouse or any other person who could or might possibly
receive payments under this Agreement. In the event of any attempted assignment, alienation, encumbrance or transfer, Provident shall have no further liability under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Amendment and Termination</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement may be amended or terminated at any
time and in any respect by the written agreement of Provident and the Executive. Provident's Board of Directors may amend or terminate this Agreement at any time without the Executive's consent by
advance written notice delivered to the Executive, provided that the Board may not unilaterally: (i)&nbsp;reduce or modify the Executive's accrued benefit determined as of the date written notice of
the amendment or termination is received by the Executive or (ii)&nbsp;amend or terminate this Agreement in any respect after a Change in Control has occurred. The Executive's accrued benefit as of
any date is the vested Supplemental Benefit (and spouse's Death Benefit) that he and his spouse would receive, under this Agreement, if that date were his Termination Date (but the Supplemental
Benefit payments are to be deferred until his actual Termination Date occurs, without actuarial increase). </FONT></P>

adopted prior to this Agreement that provides retirement benefits to the Executive, except (i)&nbsp;any retirement or other deferred compensation plan intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;401 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (ii)&nbsp;any plan or agreement that expressly provides that its benefits are not to be superseded by this Agreement and (iii)&nbsp;any nonqualified plan or
agreement to which the Executive has made contributions directly or by salary reduction. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Construction</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall be construed according to the laws of
Maryland, except where superseded by Federal law. Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, use of the singular case includes the plural, and vice versa. The invalidity of any portion
of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remainder of the Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect. The Supplemental Benefits and the Spouse's Benefits are to be payable in the same
manner as salary payments are made by Provident to its executives. All payments are subject to applicable withholding and other taxes required by law. </FONT></P>

Regulation&nbsp;13D-G, or any successor provisions thereto, promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred only if (a)&nbsp;any
"person" (as that term is used in Section&nbsp;13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13d-3 issued under the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of securities of Parent or Provident representing ten percent (10%) or more of
