                          2. SALE AND PURCHASE/VOLUME

      (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2, for each of the 12
Contract Years 2003 through 2014, inclusive, and during any extension of the
term of this Agreement, Cliffs shall sell and deliver to Inland, and Inland
shall purchase and receive from Cliffs and pay Cliffs for, a tonnage of Cliffs
Pellets equal to 100% of the total pellet tonnage consumed in the blast furnaces
or other areas that use prime blast furnace pellets (assuming the Cliffs Pellets
meet the applicable quality requirements of those other areas), at Inland's
facility at Indiana Harbor, Indiana (the "INDIANA HARBOR PLANT"), adjusted for
inventory positions, in excess of Inland's Equity Entitlements ("EXCESS ANNUAL
REQUIREMENTS") for such Contract Year; provided, however, that (i) in no
Contract Year shall Inland purchase and receive from Cliffs and the Partnership,
collectively, pursuant to (A) the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement and (B) this
Agreement, and pay Cliffs and the Partnership, collectively, for, less than [* *
* *] tons of Cliffs Pellets, and (ii) by January 31, 2008 Inland shall have
purchased and received from Cliffs and the Partnership, collectively, pursuant
to the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement and this Agreement, and have paid Cliffs and the
Partnership, collectively, for, not less than [* * * *] tons of Cliffs Pellets.
If Inland plans to close any blast furnace at the Indiana Harbor Plant for a
minimum of two years, Inland shall notify Cliffs a minimum of one year prior to
such blast furnace closure date, and the minimum annual tonnage of Cliffs
Pellets to be purchased and received by Inland from Cliffs and the Partnership,
collectively, under clause (i) of the proviso in the foregoing sentence shall be
reduced by (x) 500,000 tons per Contract Year, prorated for the first Contract
Year based upon when during such Contract Year such closure is effective for the
first blast furnace closed, (y) an additional 800,000 tons per Contract Year,
prorated for the first Contract Year based upon when during such Contract Year
such closure is effective for the second blast furnace closed, and (z) an
additional 1,200,000 tons per Contract Year, prorated for the first Contract
Year based upon when during such Contract Year such closure is effective for the
third blast furnace closed, but no change shall be made to the minimum tonnage
under clause (ii) of such proviso. If a blast furnace for which a reduction has
been granted, reopens less than 2 years after the effective date of closure,
Inland's Excess Annual Requirement for the then-current Contract Year shall
immediately be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which actual tons
purchased by Inland in the affected years was less than the then applicable
purchase requirements for such affected years (without regard to the reduction
taken for the re-opened furnace).

      (b) For each of the 12 Contract Years 2003 through 2014, inclusive, and
during any extension of the term of this Agreement, Cliffs shall be obligated to
sell and deliver to Inland 100% of its Excess Annual Requirements, up to [* * *
*] tons of Cliffs Pellets per Contract Year. If Inland's Excess Annual
Requirements, as initially fixed pursuant to Section 5(a) or as adjusted
pursuant to Section 5(c), in any Contract Year exceeds [* * * *] tons, Cliffs
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to sell and deliver any pellets in
excess of [* * * *] tons. For purposes of this Section 2(b) the Cliffs Pellets
supplied by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement shall count as
Cliffs Pellets supplied by Cliffs in discharge of its obligation to supply
Inland's Excess Annual Requirements. In the event that Cliffs fails to supply
Inland's

Excess Annual Requirements which Cliffs is required to supply in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof or fails to cause the Partnership to supply
Inland's Empire Equity Tonnage which the Partnership is required to supply in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement, which
failure remains uncured for 60 days (or any such shorter period of time after
which all or substantially all of Inland's pellet inventory will be consumed or
used) after notice is given by Inland of such failure (the aggregate shortfall
from Inland's Excess Annual Requirements and Empire Equity Tonnage being
referred to herein as the "SUPPLY SHORTFALL"), then Inland may, at its sole
option, "cover" by making any reasonable purchase of or contract to purchase
pellets in substitution for those due from Cliffs hereunder and from the
Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement. Inland shall be entitled to
recover from Cliffs as damages ("COVERING COSTS") the difference between the
cost of covering and the price herein provided for [* * * *] and such other
incidental costs (such as storage and transport) related thereto, but less any
other expenses saved as a result of Cliffs' failure. In addition to the
foregoing, if the aggregate Supply Shortfall in a given Contract Year [* * * *]
of an amount equal to Inland's Excess Annual Requirements plus the Empire Equity
Tonnage, in each case for such Contract Year, and if Inland exercises its rights
to "cover" in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then [* * * *] for such
Contract Year [* * * *]. The [* * * *] shall be applied in full against the next
payment then due under Section 7(a)(ii) (and, if such reduction is larger than
such payment, against the next succeeding payments due under Section 7(a)(ii)
until such [* * * *] is recouped in full, with any unrecouped amounts still
outstanding at the end of the term of this Agreement to be paid in full by
Cliffs at that time). In the event that the [* * * *] is triggered and Inland
proceeds to cover in the manner permitted by this Section 2(b) and to recover
damages from Cliffs on account thereof, the expenses saved referred to in the
fourth sentence of this Section 2(b) shall include the amount by which the [* *
* *] has been reduced, as long as the Supply Shortfall does not exceed [* * * *]
with respect to the first [* * * *] hereunder, [* * * *] for the second [* * *
*] hereunder, and [* * * *] for any additional [* * * *] hereunder.

                                  3. SOURCING

      (a) Cliffs shall initially supply Inland with pellets produced at the
Partnership's iron ore pellet plant ("EMPIRE STANDARD PELLETS", "EMPIRE ROYAL
PELLETS" and "EMPIRE VICEROY PELLETS", as the case may be; and, collectively,
"EMPIRE PELLETS") located in Palmer, Michigan (the "EMPIRE PLANT").

      (b) As long as Cliffs continues as a participant in the Wabush Mines Joint
Venture, Inland may change pellet sourcing, for up to [* * * *] tons of pellets
annually, from Empire Pellets to pellets produced at the Wabush Mines Joint
Venture iron ore pellet plant ("WABUSH 2% MN STANDARD PELLETS," "WABUSH 2% MN
FLUX PELLETS," "WABUSH 1% MN STANDARD PELLETS" and "WABUSH 1% MN FLUX PELLETS,"
as the case may be; and, collectively, "WABUSH PELLETS") located in Pointe
Noire, Quebec (the "WABUSH PLANT").

      (c) Cliffs may change pellet sourcing from Empire Standard Pellets to
standard pellets from other sources controlled or managed by Cliffs, provided
such pellets are of a quality comparable to that required for Empire Standard
Pellets hereunder ("OTHER CLIFFS STANDARD PELLETS"). If Cliffs desires to
provide Inland with Other Cliffs Standard Pellets, Cliffs shall give Inland not
less than three months' prior notice, and then may make such change provided
that Inland has had a reasonable opportunity to purge its stockpile of
conflicting grades of pellets.

      (d) In the event that Empire Pellets are no longer being produced at the
Empire Plant due to a permanent shutdown or a long-term (defined as not less
than 2 years) idle period (an "EMPIRE SHUTDOWN"), Cliffs shall provide one
year's advance notice thereof and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
identify one or more alternative sources of fluxed pellets ("OTHER CLIFFS FLUXED
PELLETS") and Other Cliffs Standard Pellets to be supplied by Cliffs.

            (i)   In the event that, at least 90 days prior to the Empire
                  Shutdown, Cliffs establishes that it can supply Other Cliffs
                  Pellets having the grades and specifications in chemical and
                  physical structure described in Exhibit 3(d) attached hereto
                  and identified as Key OCFP Specs (the "KEY OCFP SPECS") from
                  one or more sources, excluding Tilden Hematite Pellets (being
                  those pellets produced at the Tilden Mining Company L.C. iron
                  ore pellet plant located in Tilden, Michigan), and the
                  quantity of Wabush Pellets being limited to Inland's
                  requirements for Wabush Pellets (it being understood that
                  Cliffs shall limit sources to no more than two sources per
                  pellet grade type and that Inland shall not be obligated to
                  use more pellet sources than is commercially reasonable from a
                  logistical standpoint), then (A) Cliffs shall offer for sale
                  and delivery, and Inland may, at its option, purchase and
                  receive, such Other Cliffs Fluxed Pellets and/or Other Cliffs
                  Standard Pellets, as the case may be, in substitution for
                  Empire Royal Pellets, Empire Viceroy Pellets or Empire
                  Standard Pellets, as the case may be, hereunder, (B) Inland
                  shall notify Cliffs within 90 days of Cliffs' offering such
                  Other Cliffs Fluxed Pellets and/or such other Cliffs Standard
                  Pellets of the quantities of each such Pellet grade that
                  Inland elects to purchase and receive, (C) to the extent that
                  Inland elects to purchase and receive such Other Cliffs
                  Pellets, without limitation of the obligation to meet the Key
                  OCFP Specs or the grade and quality specifications set forth

                  efforts to ensure that Other Cliffs Fluxed Pellets and/or
                  Other Cliffs Standard Pellets, as the case may be, meet the
                  specifications described in Exhibit 3(d) attached hereto that
                  are identified as Secondary OCFP Specs (the "SECONDARY OCFP

                  Cliffs cannot establish that it can supply the Other Cliffs
                  Pellets meeting the Key OCFP Specs, then either party may
                  immediately terminate this Agreement by written notice to the
                  other party, in which case each party's obligations under this
                  Agreement shall immediately terminate (including, without
                  limitation, Inland's obligation to pay any [* * * *] and such
                  termination of this Agreement shall be without further
                  recourse to either party; provided, however, that Inland may
                  take possession of all Cliffs Pellets for which payment under
                  Section 7(a)(i) has been made and Cliffs shall deliver such
                  pellets.

With respect to all Other Cliffs Pellets, pellet cooling, stockpiling, and dust
suppression practices will be optimized on a commercially reasonable basis to
avoid excessive moisture content in pellets. Within the one-year notice period
applicable to an Empire Shutdown, Cliffs shall

provide Inland with a reasonable opportunity to conduct a blast furnace trial
not less than 90 days prior to the effective date of an Empire Shutdown on the
Other Cliffs Pellets to be supplied pursuant to this Section 3(d).

                             4. GRADES AND QUALITY

      (a) Empire Pellets shall consist of the grades and specifications and
shall have the chemical and physical structure described in Exhibit A - 1 (the
"GRADE AND QUALITY SPECS") attached hereto, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
Cliffs will aim for the mid range of each specification, review production
quality data monthly and adjust procedures where applicable to attempt to
produce at the mid range of the specifications. Should Cliffs Pellets have
values outside of the specification range (quantity and quality as determined by
reference to such Exhibit A-1), then [* * * *]. For purposes of this Section
4(a), the terms "Empire Pellets" and "Cliffs Pellets" shall be deemed to include
pellets supplied by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement.

      (b) Wabush Pellets to be sold hereunder shall consist of the grades and
specifications, and shall have approximately the same general average chemical
and physical structure, as described in Exhibit A-2, and will be in conformance
with Wabush Mine cargo quality specifications as may be agreed to by the Wabush
Mine owners; provided, however, that if there is a material change in such
specifications, Inland may, notwithstanding any limitation contained in Section
5 hereof, adjust its Excess Annual Requirements for the then-current Contract
Year with respect to Wabush Pellets. Should any cargo of Wabush Pellets sold
hereunder have chemical, physical, or metallurgical properties that materially
deviate from those specifications shown in Exhibit A-2 or such changes to those
specifications as agreed to by the Wabush Mine owners, then Cliffs and Inland [*
* * *].

      (c) Whenever any material amount of Cliffs Pellets delivered hereunder is
outside of the specification range (determined by reference to the Grade and
Quality Specs), Cliffs shall immediately furnish Inland with an off-spec report
in Inland's designated format, an example of which is attached hereto as Exhibit
A-3, defining parameter, time, cause and corrective action. With respect to any
Cliffs Pellets purchased and sold hereunder that have characteristics [* * * *]
(determined by reference to the Grade and Quality Specs), where applicable [* *
* *] in the Grade and Quality Specs). The [* * * *] referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence [* * * *] (and, if such [* * * *]. With respect
to any Cliffs Pellets purchased and sold hereunder that have characteristics [*
* * *], determined by reference to the Grade and Quality Specs [* * * *], Inland
shall (i) [* * * *] for consumption in an Indiana Harbor Plant blast furnace,
and/or (ii) determine (A) which of any such [* * * *] or (B) which of any such
[* * * *], in either such case, Inland will supply notice to Cliffs within 15
days of the shipment date as to the [* * * *] shall be (including, without

Grade and Quality Specs) that is equal to [* * * *]. Any [* * * *] shall count
towards Inland's minimum purchase requirements contained in Section 2(a) hereof.
For purposes of this Section 4(c), the term "Cliffs Pellets" shall be deemed to
include pellets supplied by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement.

      (d) During the term of this Agreement and for all subsequent extensions
pursuant to Section 18, Cliffs shall (and shall cause the Partnership to) make a
good faith effort to comply

with Inland requests for pellet quality improvement or development
recommendations. The costs of such efforts or changes shall be allocated between
the parties as mutually agreed.

                         5. NOTIFICATION AND NOMINATION

      (a) With respect to the tonnage of Cliffs Pellets to be purchased by
Inland for each of the Contract Years 2003 through 2014, inclusive, as provided
for in Section 2(a), on or before October 31 (excluding the Contract Year 2003
which has been provided for in Section 5(e)) of each of the Contract Years prior
to the Contract Years above, Inland shall notify Cliffs in writing of: (i)
Inland's initial preliminary total annual pellet tonnage requirements, (ii)
Inland's initial preliminary Excess Annual Requirements plus the Empire Equity
Tonnage, and (iii) Inland's initial preliminary tonnages of each of the grades
of ore nominated by Inland under the preceding clause (i).

      (b) With respect to the tonnage of Cliffs Pellets to be purchased by
Inland for each of the Contract Years 2003 through 2014, inclusive (except as
otherwise provided in Section 5(e) hereof), as provided for in Section 2(a), and
during the period October 31 through November 30 of each of the Contract Years
prior to the remaining Contract Years above, Inland and Cliffs shall meet, as
needed, to discuss: (i) Inland's preliminary total annual pellet tonnage
requirements; (ii) Inland's preliminary Excess Annual Requirements plus the
Empire Equity Tonnage; (iii) the preliminary tonnages and grades of Cliffs
Pellets which Cliffs is required to sell and Inland is required to purchase
pursuant to the terms of Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above; and (iv) a preliminary
delivery schedule by ore grade for each month of the following Contract Year.
Such matters shall be reduced to writing and exchanged by the parties with
Inland confirming its preliminary Excess Annual Requirements by November 30 of
each such Contract Year. If Inland's preliminary Excess Annual Requirements,
when added with its Empire Equity Tonnage, exceed [* * * *] tons, Cliffs may, by
notice to Inland but in any case subject to its obligations to use commercially
reasonable efforts pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, notify Inland of its
inability (and the extent of such inability) to deliver such excess amount of
Cliffs Pellets (the "SHORTFALL NOTICE"). If Cliffs delivers a Shortfall Notice,
Inland may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, obtain the amount
designated in the Shortfall Notice from other suppliers. If no Shortfall Notice
is received by November 30, Cliffs shall be deemed to have agreed hereunder to
supply the full amount of Inland's Excess Annual Requirements plus Inland's
Empire Equity Tonnage (including any amount in excess of [* * * *] tons).

      (c) (i) With respect to the notification of Inland's preliminary Excess
Annual Requirements of Cliffs Pellets as provided for in Sections 5(a) and 5(b)
above, on or before March 15 of the then current Contract Year of the purchase
and sale, Inland may, by written notification to Cliffs, adjust its preliminary
Excess Annual Requirements by tonnage for the then current Contract Year either
up, or by not more than [* * * *] of the total of Empire Equity Tonnage and
Excess Annual Requirements down. If Inland increases its preliminary Excess
Annual Requirements for the then current Contract Year, any such increase must
be approved by Cliffs, and on or before March 31, Cliffs shall notify Inland as
to whether or not Cliffs agrees to such increase or any part thereof. In the
event Cliffs does not agree to such increase or any part thereof, Inland may,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, obtain the increased amount
from other suppliers. If, by March 15 of the then current Contract Year, Inland
shall have adjusted its preliminary Excess Annual Requirements, either up or
down (with any

increased adjustment having been agreed to by Cliffs), then such adjusted Excess
Annual Requirements by pellet grade (subject to Section 5(d)) and tonnage shall
be deemed Inland's final Excess Annual Requirements for such Contract Year, and
Inland shall be obligated to purchase and Cliffs shall be obligated to sell such
tonnage of Cliffs Pellets in accordance with such final Excess Annual
Requirements.

            (ii)  If, however, Inland has not adjusted its preliminary Excess
                  Annual Requirements as provided for in Section 5(c)(i), then
                  on or before May 15 of the then current Contract Year of the
                  purchase and sale, Inland may, by written notification to
                  Cliffs, adjust its preliminary Excess Annual Requirements by
                  tonnage for the then current Contract Year either up, or by
                  not more than [* * * *] of the total of Empire Equity Tonnage
                  and Excess Annual Requirements down. If Inland increases its
                  preliminary Excess Annual Requirements for the then current
                  Contract Year, any such increase must be approved by Cliffs,
                  and on or before May 31, Cliffs shall notify Inland as to
                  whether or not Cliffs agrees to such increase or any part
                  thereof. In the event Cliffs does not agree to such increase
                  or any part thereof, Inland may, notwithstanding anything to
                  the contrary herein, obtain the increased amount from other
                  suppliers. If, by May 15 of the then current CONTRACT Year,
                  Inland shall have adjusted its preliminary Excess Annual
                  Requirements, either up or down (with any increased adjustment
                  having been agreed to by Cliffs), then such adjusted Excess
                  Annual Requirements by pellet grade (subject to Section 5(d))
                  and tonnage shall be deemed to be Inland's final Excess Annual
                  Requirements for such Contract Year, and Inland shall be
                  obligated to purchase, and Cliffs shall be obligated to sell,
                  such tonnage of Cliffs Pellets in accordance with such final
                  Excess Annual Requirements.

            (iii) If, however, Inland has not adjusted its preliminary Excess
                  Annual Requirements as provided for in Section 5(c)(i) or
                  5(c)(ii), then on or before July 15 of the then current
                  Contract Year of the purchase and sale, Inland may, by written
                  notification to Cliffs, adjust its preliminary Excess Annual
                  Requirements by tonnage for the then current Contract Year
                  either up, or by not more than [* * * *] of the total of
                  Empire Equity Tonnage and Excess Annual Requirements down. If
                  Inland increases its preliminary Excess Annual Requirements
                  for the then current Contract Year, any such increase must be
                  approved by Cliffs, and on or before July 31, Cliffs shall
                  notify Inland as to whether or not Cliffs agrees to such
                  increase or any part thereof. In the event Cliffs does not
                  agree to such increase or any part thereof, Inland may,
                  notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, obtain the
                  increased amount from other suppliers. If, by July 15 of the
                  then current Contract Year, Inland shall have adjusted its
                  preliminary Excess Annual Requirements, either up or down
                  (with any increased adjustment having been agreed to by
                  Cliffs), then such adjusted Excess Annual Requirements by
                  pellet grade (subject to Section 5(d)) and tonnage shall be
                  deemed to be Inland's final Excess Annual Requirements for
                  such Contract Year, and Inland shall be obligated to purchase,
                  and

                  Cliffs shall be obligated to sell, such tonnage of Cliffs
                  Pellets in accordance with such final Excess Annual
                  Requirements.

                  (iv) If no adjustment is made on or before July 15, then the
                  preliminary Excess Annual Requirements by pellet grade
                  (subject to Section 5(d)) and tonnage for the then current
                  Contract Year shall be deemed to be Inland's final Excess
                  Annual Requirements for such Contract Year, and Inland shall
                  be obligated to purchase, and Cliffs shall be obligated to
                  sell, such tonnage of Cliffs Pellets in accordance with such
                  preliminary Excess Annual Requirements.

      (d) At any time during the Contract Year, Inland may request an adjustment
in the allocation among pellet grades of pellets provided by Cliffs hereunder
and by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement, and Cliffs shall (and
shall cause the Partnership to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
accommodate such request. Cliffs shall not produce tonnage in a grade designated
for Inland more than three months ahead of when the grade should be available
for Inland.

      (e) During the Contract Year 2003, Cliffs shall sell and deliver and
Inland shall purchase and receive from Cliffs hereunder and the Partnership
under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement and pay for a tonnage of Cliffs Pellets,
including for purposes of this Section 5(e) pellets within the Empire Equity
Tonnage, of such grades and qualities as set forth in Exhibit 5(e) subject to
the delivery schedule set forth in Exhibit 5(e).

                            6. PRICE AND ADJUSTMENTS

      (a) In each Contract Year the price paid for the Cliffs Pellets purchased
and sold hereunder shall be determined as follows:

                  (i)   First, taking each kind of Basic Cliffs Pellets
                        separately, the price per iron unit shall be determined
                        as provided in Section 6(b).

                  (ii)  Second, the price per iron unit for any kind(s) of Other
                        Cliffs Pellets shall be determined as provided in
                        Section 6(c).

meet Inland's Excess Annual Requirements for such Contract Year, to be
determined in each case by multiplying such Excess Annual Requirements by the
Expected Iron Content and the Base Price per Iron Unit, plus the appropriate
Flux Charge per Ton, [* * * *]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
payments required to be made by Inland pursuant to Section 7(a)(ii) shall be
made by Inland during the initial term of this Agreement [* * * *].

      (b) The payments provided for in Section 7(a)(i) shall be adjusted as
follows:

            (i)   In the event of any adjustment to the Excess Annual
                  Requirements pursuant to Section 5(b), any payments to be made
                  pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) after such adjustment shall be
                  increased or decreased so that such payments will be equal in
                  amount.

            (ii)  Beginning in [* * * *], not later than June 15 of each
                  Contract Year, Cliffs shall prepare and certify to Inland (x)
                  Cliffs' calculation of the Composite Index and the Flux
                  Composite Index for such Contract Year, (y) Cliffs'
                  recalculation of the Base Price per Iron Unit and Flux Charge
                  per Ton for each kind of Cliffs Pellets, based thereon, and
                  (z) the amount of the difference between the amount previously
                  paid for Cliffs Pellets during the Contract Year and the
                  amount that would have been paid had such adjusted Composite
                  Index and Flux Composite Index been in effect from the
                  beginning of the Contract Year. All subsequent payments to be
                  made under Section 7(a)(i) shall be adjusted to reflect the
                  revised Base Price per Iron Unit and Flux Charge per Ton, and
                  the next such payment shall be adjusted by the amount
                  specified in clause (z) above. For purposes of this Section
                  7(b)(ii), the term "Cliffs Pellets" shall be deemed to include
                  pellets supplied by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales
                  Agreement.

      (c) In addition to the adjustments to be made pursuant to Section 7(b),
not later than January 31 of each Contract Year, Cliffs shall prepare and
certify to Inland: (x) Cliffs' calculation of the actual tonnage of each kind of
Cliffs Pellets and any variance from tonnage forecast to be delivered to satisfy
Inland's Excess Annual Requirements, in each case for the prior Contract Year;
(y) the actual iron units in each kind of Cliffs Pellets, and any variance from
the Expected Iron Content expected therefore, in each case for the prior
Contract Year; and (z) the amount due from Cliffs to Inland, or vice versa, to
adjust to correct for all of the variances in clauses (x) and (y) for the prior
Contract Year. The payment due pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) next occurring after
January 31 shall be adjusted by the amount specified in clause (z).

      (d) All payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds according to such instructions as Cliffs may from time to time provide,
and shall be made in U.S. dollars.

      (e) In the event Inland purchases Cliffs Pellets required to be purchased
under this Agreement in advance of the required date for such purchase, during
the 12-month period following the date of such purchase Inland shall be entitled
to defer a subsequent required purchase of Cliffs Pellets having an aggregate
price equal to the aggregate price of the Cliffs

Pellets purchased in advance for the same number of days as the advance purchase
was in advance of its required date. Purchases of Cliffs Pellets required under
this Agreement which are made in advance in January of any Contract Year shall
be counted as purchases of Cliffs Pellets for purposes of Inland's Excess Annual
Requirements for the next following Contract Year.

      (f) In the event Inland shall fail to make payment when due of any amounts
(other than amounts disputed in good faith by Inland), Cliffs, in addition to
all other remedies available to Cliffs in law or in equity, shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to withhold further performance by Cliffs under
this Agreement until all claims Cliffs may have against Inland under this
Agreement are fully satisfied.

      (g) Exhibit B illustrates the operation of the provisions of this Section
7.

                           8. SHIPMENTS AND DELIVERY

      (a) Cliffs and Inland will agree on a mutually acceptable delivery
schedule for each Contract Year prior to December 1 of the preceding Contract
Year and Cliffs shall make pellets available hereunder in accordance with such
schedule. Such schedule must be established to match both Inland's blast furnace
requirements and Cliffs' pellet availability and will include monthly shipment
tonnage by grade. Cliffs and Inland will balance the delivery schedule by pellet
source and type so that monthly shipments will be relatively equal over the
Contract Year, considering winter shipping restrictions and production schedules
to the locations designated in Section 8(b) below. Cliffs and Inland recognize
that changes in schedule will occur as provided in Section 5, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such changes. For purposes of
this Section 8(a), the term "pellets" shall be deemed to include pellets
supplied by the Partnership under the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement.

      (b) Deliveries shall be made as follows:

            (i)   Deliveries of Empire Pellets shall be made by Cliffs to Inland
                  f.o.b. [* * * *], and title and all risk of loss (other than
                  loss associated with shrinkage and, pellet handling and care
                  in the ordinary course in the stockpile at such Dock), damage
                  or destruction shall pass to Inland at the time that payment
                  is received for such delivery of such Pellets (For purposes of
                  this Section 8(b)(i), the term "Empire Pellets" shall be
                  deemed to include pellets supplied by the Partnership under
                  the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement.);

            (ii)  Deliveries of Wabush Pellets shall be made by Cliffs to Inland
                  f.o.b. vessel, Port of Pointe Noire, Quebec, or stockpiled at
                  Wabush Dock in Pointe Noire, Quebec, and title and all risk of
                  loss (other than loss associated with shrinkage and, pellet
                  handling and care in the ordinary course in the stockpile at
                  such Dock), damage or destruction shall pass to Inland at the
                  time that payment is received for such delivery of such
                  Pellets; and

            (iii) Deliveries of Other Cliffs Pellets shall be made by Cliffs to
                  Inland f.o.b. [* * * *], and title and all risk of loss (other
                  than loss associated with

                  shrinkage and, pellet handling and care in the ordinary course
                  in the stockpile at such locations), damage or destruction
                  shall pass to Inland at the time that payment is received for
                  such delivery of such Pellets;

provided, however, that Inland shall not be entitled to take delivery or
possession of any Cliffs Pellets until Cliffs shall have received payment for
such Pellets.

                                   9. WEIGHTS

      Vessel bill of lading weight determined by railroad scale weights or belt
scale weights, certified in accordance with standard commercial practices, in
accordance with the procedures in effect from time to time at each of the
loading ports (which shall be reasonably acceptable to Inland), shall be
accepted by the parties as determining the amount of Cliffs Pellets delivered to
Inland pursuant to this Agreement. The weighing devices shall be regularly
tested, verified, certified, and maintained. For those scale weights or belt
scale weights Cliffs operates, Cliffs shall maintain records of certification,
which shall be made available from time to time to Inland for review and audit.
In all other cases, Cliffs shall use commercially reasonable efforts, upon the
request of Inland, to obtain from those third parties operating the scale
weights and/or belt weights, proof of certification.

                           10. EMPLOYMENT OF VESSELS

      Inland assumes the obligation for arranging and providing appropriate
vessels for the transportation of the Cliffs Pellets delivered by Cliffs to
Inland hereunder. Inland shall arrange and provide for all vessel shipments, ore
carrier or bulk carrier type vessels suitable in all respects to enter, berth at
and leave the loading ports and suitable for the loading and mooring facilities
at the loading ports. If Cliffs supplies any Other Cliffs Pellets hereunder,
Inland shall (i) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the best
possible price and other terms for transportation of such Other Cliffs Pellets,
and (ii) certify the use of such efforts, and the prices obtained for such
transportation, to Cliffs at the end of each year. Any transportation price
information supplied to Cliffs by Inland pursuant to this Section 10 shall be
kept confidential. Cliffs shall provide Inland with a reasonable opportunity to
bid for the supply of transportation services in connection with the delivery of
flux stone to the Empire Mine. For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Cliffs
Pellets" shall be deemed to include pellets supplied by the Partnership under
the EIMP Ore Sales Agreement.

                      11. SAMPLING AND TESTING PROCEDURES

      (a) All pellet sampling procedures and analytical tests conducted on
Cliffs Pellets sold to Inland to demonstrate compliance with the Grade and
Quality Specs specified in Section 4 shall be performed by Cliffs at the loading
point on each pellet vessel shipment or train shipment, as the case may be.
Cliffs shall retain a split of each sample of whole pellets for 90 days and will
retain a ground pulp sample for chemical analysis for one year (the "SAMPLES").
Test methods to be used shall be the appropriate ASTM or ISO standard methods
published at the time of testing or any other procedures and practices that may
be mutually agreed to by Cliffs and Inland. Inland may, at any time and from
time to time through one or more authorized representatives, be present during
production, loading, or to observe sampling and analysis of

pellets being processed for shipment to Inland. In the case of a dispute between
Inland and Cliffs as to pellet analyses, a mutually agreed upon ISO 17025
certified (or such future certification standard as may replace ISO 17025)
laboratory (the "LAB") shall be utilized to resolve the dispute. Notwithstanding
Section 15 hereof, the Lab shall act as the final arbiter of all disputes
related to pellet sampling and analysis. The party found to be in error (or if
both parties are in error, both parties) shall bear the cost of the Lab.

                  employee, officer, director or consultant of, or of a direct
                  competitor of, Inland or Cliffs;

            (iii) consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each
                  party will, upon the written request of the other party,
                  promptly provide the other with copies of documents on which
                  the producing party may rely or otherwise which may be
                  relevant in support of or in opposition to any claim or
                  defense; any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or
                  scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrators, which
                  determination shall be conclusive; and all discovery shall be
                  completed within 45 days following the appointment of the
                  arbitrators;

            (iv)  in connection with any arbitration arising out of Section [* *
                  * *], each of Cliffs and Inland shall have the right to submit
                  information to the arbitrators to be held in confidence by
                  them and not disclosed to the other party (or any other
                  person); provided, however, that: (A) the party providing such
                  information shall certify its accuracy to the best of its
                  actual knowledge; and (B) such information shall be made
                  available to counsel for the other party upon delivery by such
                  counsel of its undertaking to hold the information (either in
                  the form provided or in any other form) in confidence and not
                  to disclose it to its client, or any other person (other than
                  the arbitrators)

            (v)   in connection with any arbitration arising out of Section [* *
                  * *]: (A) before making their determination in any matter, the
                  arbitrators must request from each of the parties a complete
                  statement of its proposed resolution of such matter, and the
                  arbitrators shall select between the two proposed resolutions,
                  without making any alteration to either of them (or if either
                  party does not submit a proposed resolution, or submits one
                  that is materially incomplete, shall select the proposed
                  resolution of the other party); and (B) the arbitrators shall
                  be limited to awarding only one or the other proposed
                  resolution;

            (vi)  in connection any arbitration arising out of this Agreement,
                  the arbitrators shall have no authority to alter, amend, or
                  modify any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
                  further, the arbitrators may not enter any award that alters,
                  amends or modifies terms or conditions of this Agreement in
                  any form or manner;

            (vii) the award or decision shall be made within nine months of the
                  filing of the notice of intention to arbitrate, and the
                  arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before
                  accepting appointment; provided, however, that this time limit
                  may be extended by written agreement signed by both parties or
                  by the arbitrators, if necessary; and

           (viii) in connection with any arbitration arising out of Section [*
                  * * *], the costs of the arbitrators shall be borne entirely
                  by the party that did not

                  to this Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own
                  costs and expenses, and the parties will equally split the
                  cost of conducting the arbitration itself.

      (b) The judgment of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
and enforced by any court of the United States or any state thereof.

                               16. FORCE MAJEURE

      (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party
hereto shall be liable for damages resulting from failure to deliver or accept
and pay for all or any of the Cliffs Pellets as described herein, if and to the
extent that such delivery or acceptance would be contrary to or would constitute
a violation of any regulation, order or requirement of a recognized governmental
body or agency, or if such failure, including (a) failure of the mines supplying
the Cliffs Pellets to be delivered under this Agreement to produce the Cliffs
Pellets, or (b) failure of Inland's facilities to produce steel, is caused by or
results directly or indirectly from acts of God, war, insurrections,
interference by foreign powers, acts of terrorism, strikes, hindrances, labor
disputes, labor shortages, fires, flood, embargoes, accidents or delays at the
mines, on the railroads or docks or in transit, shortage of transportation
facilities, disasters of navigation, or other causes, similar or dissimilar, if
such other causes are beyond the control of the party charged with a failure to
deliver or to accept and pay for the Cliffs Pellets. The inability to use Cliffs
Pellets as a result of any of the foregoing causes shall also be a force majeure
event under this Section, allowing Inland to fail to accept Cliffs Pellets to
the extent of such force majeure event, pro rata, with all other sources of
pellets for the Indiana Harbor Plant. To the extent a force majeure is claimed
hereunder by a party hereto, such shall relieve the other party from fulfilling
its corresponding agreement hereunder to the party claiming such force majeure,
but only for the period and to the extent of the claimed force majeure, except
as provided in Section 16(b) or unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the
parties.

      (b) If an event of force majeure is claimed by Cliffs, Inland shall be
obligated to make the payments required by Section [* * * *] and Section [* * *
*] following the date that Cliffs claimed such event of force majeure; provided,
however, that upon any termination of such event of force majeure [* * * *]
after the date that Cliffs claimed the event of force majeure, Inland shall
continue to be obligated to make the payments required by Section [* * * *] and
Section [* * * *] from the date of such termination. In addition to the
foregoing, if Cliffs is able to offer for sale Other Cliffs Pellets in
accordance with Section [* * * *], then Inland shall be obligated to [* * * *]
under such Section [* * * *]. If the event of force majeure claimed by Cliffs
continues for [* * * *] consecutive months or longer, which event covers the
supply of substantially all of Inland's Excess Annual Requirements (including,
for these purposes, the Empire Equity Tonnage) and Cliffs is not able to offer
for sale Other Cliffs Pellets in accordance with Section [* * * *], then either
Cliffs or Inland may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other. To
the extent that, pursuant to this Section, Cliffs offers for sale pellets
pursuant to Section [* * * *], the parties acknowledge and agree that the [* * *
*] shall be subject to reduction in accordance with Section [* * * *].

                                   20. WAIVER

         No waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement shall be valid unless

provision hereof or default under any provisions hereof shall be deemed a waiver

                       21. CONFIDENTIALITY; GOVERNING LAW

         (a) Cliffs and Inland acknowledge that this Agreement contains certain
volume pricing, adjustment and term provisions which are confidential,
proprietary or of a sensitive commercial nature and which would put Cliffs or
Inland at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed to the public, specifically,
Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 13, and all of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto
("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"). Cliffs and Inland further agree that all
provisions of this Agreement shall be kept confidential and, without the prior
consent of the other party, shall not be disclosed to any party not a party to
this Agreement or the legal advisor to a party to this Agreement except as
required by law or governmental or judicial order and except that disclosure of
the existence of this Agreement shall not be precluded by this Section 21.

         (b) If either party is required by law or governmental or judicial
order or receives legal process or a court or agency directive requesting or
requiring disclosure of any of the Confidential Information contained in this
Agreement, such party will promptly notify the other party prior to disclosure
to permit such party to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action
to preserve the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. If either
party determines to file this Agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("COMMISSION") or any

                                       23
<PAGE>
other federal, state, provincial or local governmental or regulatory authority,
or with any stock exchange or similar body, such determining party will use its
best efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential Information
pursuant to any applicable rule, regulation or procedure of the Commission and
any applicable rule, regulation or procedure relating to confidential filings
made with any such other authority or exchange. If the Commission (or any such
other authority or exchange) denies such party's request for confidential
treatment of such Confidential Information, such party will use its best efforts
to obtain confidential treatment of the portions thereof that the other party
designates. Each party will allow the other party to participate in seeking to
obtain such confidential treatment for Confidential Information.

         (c) This Agreement shall in all respects, including matters of
construction, validity and performance, be governed by and be construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.

                                 22. ASSIGNMENT

         (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Inland" includes and
means not only Inland, but also any successor by merger or consolidation of
Inland and any permitted assigns of Inland.

         (b) In case Inland shall consolidate with or merge into another Person
or shall transfer to another Person all or substantially all of its iron and
steel business, this Agreement shall be assigned by Inland to, and shall be
binding upon, the Person resulting from such consolidation or merger or the
Person to which such transfer is made; otherwise no assignment of this Agreement
by Inland shall be valid unless Cliffs shall consent in writing thereto.

         (c) In case CCIC or CMC, or any permitted assign of either of them,
shall consolidate with or merge into another corporation or shall transfer to
another Person all or substantially all of its business, this Agreement shall be
assigned by CCIC or CMC, as the case may be, to, and shall be binding upon, the
corporation resulting from such consolidation or merger or the Person to which
such transfer is made; otherwise, no assignment of this Agreement by CCIC or
CMC, as the case may be, shall be valid unless Inland shall consent thereto in
writing.

         (d) All the covenants, stipulations and agreements herein contained
shall inure to the benefit of and bind the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

                               23. CONFIDENTIALITY

         None of the parties hereto or their Affiliates will issue any press
release or otherwise disclose or make any public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written or oral consent of an
officer of the other parties, except to the extent that the disclosing party
determines in good faith that it is so obligated by law, in which case such
disclosing party shall give notice to the other parties in advance of such
party's intent to make such disclosure, announcement or issue such press release
and the parties hereto or their affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to cause
a mutually agreeable release or disclosure or announcement to be issued.
