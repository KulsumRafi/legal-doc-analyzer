------------ --------------

(a)  As consideration for the purchase of the Banking Centers,  Purchasers shall
     pay Sellers a purchase price equal to the sum of the following:

     (1)  the "Net Book Value" (as defined in  paragraph  2.2(d)  hereof) of the
          Personal  Property and the Real Property at the Banking Centers on the
          Closing Date;

     (2)  a premium  for the  "Deposit  Liabilities"  (as  defined in  paragraph
          2.3(a)  hereof) and franchise  value  assigned to the Banking  Centers
          equal to 11.0% of such Deposit Liabilities;

     (3)  the "Net Book Value" (as defined in  paragraph  2.2(d)  hereof) of the
          Loans as set forth in Section 2.4 hereof as of the Effective Time; and

     (4)  the face amount of the Coins and Currency.

(b)  In addition, Purchasers shall assume, as of the Effective Time, the Deposit
     Liabilities and all duties, obligations,  and liabilities related to any of
     the following  accruing or arising on or after the Effective  Time: (i) the
     Real Property,  (ii) the Real Property Lease,  (iii) the Equipment  Leases,

<PAGE>

(c)  Sellers shall prepare a balance sheet (the "Pre-Closing  Balance Sheet") in
     accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  consistently
     applied  as of a date  not  earlier  than 30  calendar  days  prior  to the
     Effective Time anticipated by the parties (the  "Pre-Closing  Balance Sheet
     Date")  reflecting  the assets to be sold and  assigned  hereunder  and the
     liabilities to be transferred and assumed  hereunder.  Sellers agree to pay
     to  Purchasers  at the  Closing  (as  defined in Section  3.1  hereof),  in
     immediately  available funds,  the excess amount,  if any, of the amount of
     Deposit  Liabilities assumed by Purchasers pursuant to paragraph (b) above,
     as reflected by the Pre-Closing  Balance Sheet, over the aggregate purchase
     price computed in accordance  with paragraph (a) above, as reflected by the
     Pre-Closing Balance Sheet.  Purchasers agree to pay Sellers at the Closing,
     in  immediately  available  funds,  the excess,  if any,  of the  aggregate
     purchase  price  computed  in  accordance  with  paragraph  (a)  above,  as
     reflected  by the  Pre-Closing  Balance  Sheet,  over the amount of Deposit
     Liabilities  assumed by  Purchasers  pursuant to  paragraph  (b) above,  as
     reflected by the Pre-Closing  Balance Sheet. The purchase price, as well as
     each of the items described in paragraphs  (a)(1) through (4) above and all
     amounts paid at the Closing shall be subject to subsequent adjustment based
     on the Post-Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 3.3 hereof).

(d)  The "Net Book  Values" of the Personal  Property and the Real  Property are
     the values that the relevant assets are carried on Sellers' general ledger.
     The "Net Book Value" of the Loans is the aggregate  principal amount of the
     Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest,  late charges, bad check fees, and
     other accrued  charges  thereon,  but such value shall not include any loan
     loss reserves or general reserve.

(e)  Sellers and  Purchasers  agree to allocate the purchase price in accordance
     with  Section 1060 of the Internal  Revenue Code (the  "Code").  Within 120
     days  after  the  Closing  Date,   Purchasers   shall  provide  to  Sellers
     Purchasers' proposed allocation of the purchase price as finally determined
     and paid by Purchasers hereunder.  Within 30 days after the receipt of such
     allocation,  Sellers  shall  propose  to  Purchasers  any  changes  to such
     allocation  or  otherwise   shall  be  deemed  to  have  agreed  with  such
     allocation. Sellers and Purchasers shall reduce such allocation to writing,
     including  jointly and  properly  executing a  completed  Internal  Revenue
     Service Form 8594, and any other forms or statements  required by the Code,
     Treasury  Regulations,  or the Internal Revenue Service,  together with any
     and all attachments required to be filed therewith.  Sellers and Purchasers
     shall file timely any such forms and statements  with the Internal  Revenue
     Service.  To  the  extent  consistent  with  applicable  law,  Sellers  and
     Purchasers  shall not file any tax return or other  documents  or otherwise
     take any  position  with respect to taxes which is  inconsistent  with such
     allocation of the final purchase  price,  provided,  however,  that neither
     Sellers nor Purchasers shall be obligated to litigate any challenge to such
     allocation of the final purchase price by a governmental authority. Sellers
     and Purchasers  shall  promptly  inform one another of any challenge by any
     governmental  authority to any  allocation  made pursuant to this paragraph
     and agree to consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the
     state of, and any discussion, proposal, or submission with respect to, such
     challenge.

Section 2.3. Deposit Liabilities.
------------ -------------------

(a)  "Deposit  Liabilities"  shall mean all of HNB's  duties,  obligations,  and
     liabilities,  as recorded  on HNB's  books and records as of the  Effective
     Time,  for  payment to the  depositors  of, and HNB's  written  contractual
     duties and obligations  relating to, the deposit  accounts  assigned to the
     Banking Centers as of the Effective Time  (including  accrued but unpaid or
     uncredited interest thereon).

(b)  Except  for those  liabilities  and  obligations  specifically  assumed  by
     Purchasers  under  2.2(b)  above,  Purchasers  are not  assuming  any other
     liabilities or obligations.  Liabilities not assumed  include,  but are not
     limited to, the following:

     (1)  Sellers' cashier checks,  letters of credit, money orders,  traveler's
          checks,  interest  checks  and  expense  checks  issued  prior  to the
          Effective Time,  consignments  of U.S.  Government "E" and "EE" bonds,
          and any  cash  items  paid by  Sellers  and not  cleared  prior to the
          Effective Time;

     (2)  deposit accounts associated with or securing lines of credit where the
          line of credit is excluded in accordance with paragraph 2.4(b); and

     (3)  individual  retirement accounts which, by their terms, are not subject
          to assignment, it being understood that all other types of IRA Deposit
          Liabilities are intended to be transferred.

(c)  Sellers  do not  represent  or warrant  that any  deposit  customers  whose
     accounts are assumed by Purchasers  will become or continue to be customers
     of Purchasers after the Effective Time.

(d)  After the Effective  Time,  Purchasers  agree to pay in accordance with law
     and customary  banking  practices all properly drawn and presented  checks,
     drafts,  and withdrawal  orders  presented to Purchasers by mail,  over the
     counter,  or through the check clearing  system of the banking  industry by
     depositors of the accounts assumed, whether drawn on the checks, withdrawal
     forms,  or draft  forms  provided by Sellers or by  Purchasers,  and in all
     other respects to discharge,  in the usual course of the banking  business,
     the duties and  obligations of Sellers with respect to the balances due and
     owing to the depositors whose accounts are assumed by Purchasers;  provided
     that  Purchasers  shall not be  obligated to honor or pay any item if there
     are insufficient funds in the customer's account when presented.

(e)  If, after the  Effective  Time,  any  depositor,  instead of accepting  the
     obligation  of  Purchasers to pay the Deposit  Liabilities  assumed,  shall
     demand payment from Sellers for all or any part of any such assumed Deposit
     Liabilities, Sellers shall not be liable or responsible for making any such
     payment;  provided, that if Sellers shall pay the same, Purchasers agree to


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

     reimburse Sellers for any such payments, and Sellers shall not be deemed to
     have made any  representations  or warranties to Purchasers with respect to
     any such checks,  drafts, or withdrawal orders and any such representations
     or warranties implied by law are hereby expressly  disclaimed.  Sellers and
     Purchasers shall make arrangements to provide for the daily settlement with
     immediately  available  funds by Purchasers of checks,  drafts,  withdrawal
     orders, returns, and other items presented to and paid by Sellers within 90
     calendar  days  after  the  Effective  Time and drawn on or  chargeable  to
     accounts  that have been assumed by  Purchasers;  provided,  however,  that
     Sellers shall be held harmless and  indemnified by Purchasers for acting in
     accordance with such arrangements.

(f)  Purchasers agree, at their cost and expense, (i) to notify such depositors,
     on or  before  the  Effective  Time,  in a  form  and  on a  date  mutually
     acceptable to Sellers and Purchasers,  of Purchasers' assumption of Deposit
     Liabilities,  (ii) to furnish such  depositors  with checks on the forms of
     Purchasers  and with  instructions  to  utilize  Purchasers'  checks and to
     destroy any unused check,  draft, and withdrawal order forms of Sellers (if
     Purchasers so elect, Purchasers may offer to buy from such depositors their
     unused Sellers' check, draft, and withdrawal order forms), (iii) to reissue
     all ATM and debit cards  associated  with the depositors of assumed Deposit
     Liabilities,  (iv) to replace all line of credit  checks with checks on the
     forms of Purchasers with instructions to utilize  Purchasers' checks and to
     destroy the unused  checks,  and (v) to disable and to notify  customers of
     the  disabling  of all  credit  card  overdraft  protection  or notify  the
     customers of alternative  over-draft  protection through a different credit
     card or line of credit. At their expense,  Sellers will prepare and deliver
     to Purchasers two sets of their normal customer  mailing labels relating to
     the Deposit  Liabilities.  In addition,  subsequent to regulatory approval,
     Sellers  will  notify  their  affected  customers  by letter of the pending
     assignment of Sellers'  Deposit  Liabilities  to  Purchasers,  which notice
     shall be at  Sellers'  cost and  expense  and  shall be in a form  mutually
     agreeable to Sellers and Purchasers. Sellers and Purchasers will coordinate
     with each  other as to the time and  manner of  notification  to  customers
     consistent with regulatory requirements.

(g)  Purchasers  agree to pay  promptly to Sellers an amount  equivalent  to the
     amount of any checks,  drafts, or withdrawal orders credited to any assumed
     Deposit  Liabilities  as of the Effective Time that are returned to Sellers
     after the Effective Time.

(h)  As of the Effective  Time,  Purchasers  will assume and discharge  Sellers'
     duties and  obligations  in accordance  with the terms and  conditions  and
     laws,  rules,  and regulations  that apply to the  certificates of deposit,
     accounts, and other Deposit Liabilities assumed under this Agreement.

(i)  As of the  Effective  Time,  Purchasers  will  maintain  and  safeguard  in
     accordance  with  applicable  law and sound  banking  practices all account
     documents,  deposit  contracts,  signature cards,  deposit slips,  canceled
     items, and other records related to the Deposit  Liabilities  assumed under

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     this  Agreement,  subject to  Sellers'  right of access to such  records as
     provided in this Agreement.

(j)  Sellers  will  render a final  statement  to each  depositor  of an account
     assumed  under this  Agreement  as to  transactions  occurring  through the
     Effective  Time and will  comply  with all  laws,  rules,  and  regulations
     regarding  tax  reporting  of  transactions  of such  accounts  through the
     Effective Time.  Sellers will be entitled to impose normal fees and service
     charges on a per-item  basis,  but Sellers will not impose periodic fees or
     blanket charges in connection with such final  statements.  Purchasers will
     comply with all laws,  rules,  and  regulations  regarding tax reporting of
     transactions of such accounts after the Effective Time.

(k)  Prior to the Closing Date,  Purchasers,  at their expense,  will notify all
     Automated   Clearing  House  ("ACH")   originators  of  the  transfers  and
     assumptions made pursuant to the Agreement; provided, however, that Sellers
     shall have provided Purchasers with all information  necessary to make such
     notifications  and  provided,  further,  that Sellers may, at their option,
     notify all such  originators (on behalf of Purchasers)  also at the expense
     of Purchasers.  For a period of 90 calendar days beginning on the Effective
     Time,  Sellers will honor all ACH items  related to accounts  assumed under
     this Agreement which are mistakenly routed or presented to Sellers. Sellers
     will  make no  charge to  Purchasers  for  honoring  such  items,  and will
     electronically  transmit such ACH data to Purchasers.  If Purchasers cannot
     receive  an  electronic  transmission,   Sellers  will  make  available  to
     Purchasers at Sellers' operations center receiving items from the Automated
     Clearing House tapes containing such ACH data.  Items mistakenly  routed or
     presented after the 90-day period will be returned to the presenting party.
     Sellers and  Purchasers  shall make  arrangements  to provide for the daily
     settlement with immediately  available funds by Purchasers of any ACH items
     honored by Sellers,  and Sellers shall be held harmless and  indemnified by
     Purchasers  for acting in accordance  with this  arrangement  to accept ACH
     items.

(l)  As of the  Effective  Time,  Sellers  shall  transfer and assign all files,
     documents,  and records  related to the Deposit  Liabilities to Purchasers,
     including such  information held in electronic form, and Purchasers will be
     responsible  for  maintaining  and   safeguarding  all  such  materials  in
     accordance with applicable law and sound banking practices.

(m)  Sellers  and  Purchasers  agree to  cooperate  in good  faith to  develop a
     mutually  satisfactory  method with respect to  terminating,  transferring,
     converting, and/or otherwise resolving issues related to insurance products
     associated  with  Deposit  Liabilities,   including  accidental  death  and
     dismemberment  insurance  coverage in connection with Deposit  Liabilities.
     The  parties'  obligations  in  this  paragraph  (m)  are  subject  to  any
     restrictions   contained  in  existing  insurance   contracts  as  well  as
     applicable laws and regulations.

     applicable laws and regulations.

<PAGE>

(d)  In  connection  with the  transfer  of any  Loans  requiring  notice to the
     borrower  and the  servicer,  Purchasers  and Sellers  will comply with all
     notice and reporting  requirements  of the loan  documents or of any law or
     regulation.

(e)  All Loans will be transferred  without  recourse and without any warranties
     or representations as to their  collectibility or the  creditworthiness  of
     any of the obligors of such Loans.

(f)  Purchasers will, at their expense, issue new coupon books or other forms of
     payment  identification  for  payment  of Loans for which  Sellers  provide
     coupon books with instructions to utilize  Purchasers' coupons or forms and
     to destroy coupons furnished by Sellers.

(g)  For a period of 90 calendar  days after the  Effective  Time,  Sellers will

     reimburse Sellers for checks returned on payments forwarded to Purchasers.

(h)  As of the  Effective  Time,  Sellers  shall  transfer and assign all files,
     documents,  and records related to the Loans to Purchasers,  including such
     information held in electronic form, and Purchasers will be responsible for
     maintaining  and   safeguarding  all  such  materials  in  accordance  with
     applicable law and sound banking practices.

(i)  If the balance due on any Loan  purchased  pursuant to this Section 2.4 has
     been reduced by Sellers as a result of a payment by check received prior to
     the Effective  Time,  which item is returned after the Effective  Time, the
     asset value  represented by the Loan transferred  shall be  correspondingly
     increased  and an amount in cash  equal to such  increase  shall be paid by
     Purchasers to Sellers promptly upon demand.

(j)  Sellers shall grant to Purchasers as of the Effective  Time a limited power

     entitled to use them.

     related to such safe deposit box  business to  Purchasers,  and  Purchasers

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

(c)  Safe deposit box rental payments  collected by Sellers before the Effective
     Time shall be prorated to the Closing Date.

Section 2.6. Employee Matters.
-----------  ----------------

(a)  Purchasers will offer employment to all employees of Sellers at the Banking
     Centers  as  of  the  Effective  Time  (individually,  an  "Employee,"  and
     collectively,  the "Employees").  Any Employee who is on a leave of absence
     with Sellers at the Closing Date shall be offered  employment by Purchasers
     following  their  return from such leave so long as such return is within 6
     months of the  Closing  Date.  The base salary for each  Employee  hired by
     Purchasers  shall  not be less than the base  salary  provided  by  Sellers
     immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time.  For  purposes of  eligibility,
     participation,   vesting,  and  benefit  accrual  under  the  First  United
     Corporation  401(k)  Profit  Sharing Plan or any  successor  plan  thereto,
     Purchasers agree to give the Employees that are hired by Purchasers service
     credit  for  all  periods  of  employment  with  Sellers  (including  their
     affiliates and their predecessor entities),  that are recognized by Sellers
     for those  purposes  under the  Huntington  Investment and Tax Savings Plan
     immediately  prior to the Closing Date.  With respect to Purchasers'  other
     employee  benefit plans,  including the First United Bank and Trust Pension
     Plan, the Employees will be treated as new hires, except that the Employees
     will  be  given  the  same  amount  of  service  credit  for   eligibility,
     participation,  and vesting  purposes under the First United Bank and Trust
     Pension Plan as they are given for the same purposes under the First United
     Corporation  401(k)  Profit  Sharing  Plan.  For purposes of vacation,  and
     personal day entitlement,  Family and Medical Leave Act entitlement, or any
     other  employment   policy  or  practice  where  length  of  service  is  a
     consideration,  Purchasers  agree to give the  Employees  that are hired by
     Purchasers  service  credit for all  periods  of  employment  with  Sellers
     (including  their  affiliates  and  their  predecessor  entities)  that are
     recognized by Sellers for those purposes  immediately  prior to the Closing
     Date.  For  purposes of  determining  the number of  accumulated  sick days
     Employees  will have under  Purchasers'  sick day policy as of the  Closing
     Date,  Purchasers  agree to grandfather the number of unused sick days each
     Employee has  remaining  under  Sellers'  sick day policy as of the Closing
     Date. The Employees who  immediately  become  employees of Purchasers  will
     immediately  be  eligible  to  participate  in each  welfare  benefit  plan
     maintained  by  Purchasers  without  regard  to  waiting  periods,  if such
     Employees are participating in Sellers' corresponding welfare benefit plans
     immediately prior to the Closing Date. To the extent there are pre-existing
     condition limitations under Purchasers' medical and dental plans applicable
     to any Employee, Sellers and Purchasers agree to cooperate in good faith to
     develop a  mutually  satisfactory  method to  provide  such  Employee  with
     uninterrupted  coverage and any additional cost associated with such method
     shall  be  paid  by  Purchasers.  With  respect  to  Purchaser's  long-term
     disability  plan,  Employees  who have  satisfied  all or a portion  of the
     pre-existing  condition  limitation  of the  long-term  disability  plan of
     Sellers (including their affiliates and their predecessor entities) will be
     given credit toward satisfaction of any pre-existing  condition  limitation
     in Purchaser's long-term disability plan.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

     To the  extent  that any  Employee  has  satisfied  in whole or in part any
     annual   deductible   under  a  welfare  benefit  plan,  or  has  paid  any
     out-of-pocket  expenses  pursuant to any welfare benefit plan  co-insurance
     provision,  in each case with  respect  to the  calendar  year in which the
     Closing Date occurs,  such amount shall be counted toward  satisfaction  of
     any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket  expense maximum,  respectively,
     under the  comparable  benefit  plans and programs  provided to Employee by
     Purchasers. Purchasers shall offer and pay continued salary as described in
     the Huntington Bancshares  Incorporated Transition Pay Plan to any Employee
     terminated by Purchasers without cause (as defined under the Transition Pay
     Plan, but as determined by Purchaser)  within one year of the Closing Date.
     For  purposes of  determining  the length of time for salary  continuation,
     Purchasers  agree to give  Employees  service  credit  for all  periods  of
     employment with Sellers  (including their affiliates and their  predecessor
     entities)  that are  recognized  by  Sellers  for that  purpose  under  the
     Transition Pay Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchasers shall
     not be responsible or liable for any benefits  accrued under the pension or
     welfare plans of Sellers.  Sellers will be responsible  for all accrued but
     not paid vacation pay for the Employees through the Closing Date.

(b)  After the execution of this  Agreement,  Sellers will continue their normal
     employment practices in staffing the Banking Centers; however, Sellers make
     no  representations  or  warranties  about whether any of the Employees who
     become  employees of Purchasers will remain employed at the Banking Centers
     after the  Effective  Time.  Sellers  will:  (i) use their best  efforts to
     maintain the Employees as employees of Sellers at the Banking Centers until
     the  Effective  Time,  (ii)  refrain  from  dissuading  any  Employee  from
     accepting an offer of employment  with  Purchasers,  and (iii) refrain from
     recruiting  employees for alternate  positions with Sellers.  Sellers shall
     affirmatively advise Banking Centers Employees that their current positions
     will  terminate as of the Effective  Time.  Any Employee  whose  employment
     shall be  terminated  for any reason prior to the  Effective  Time shall be
     dealt with by Sellers in their sole and absolute discretion.  Sellers agree
     that,  for a period of 24  months  after the  Closing  Date,  they will not
     solicit for employment any Employee who remains employed by Purchasers.

(c)  After  the   execution  of  this   Agreement   and  subject  to  any  legal
     restrictions, Sellers shall permit Purchasers, at reasonable times and upon
     reasonable  notice,  to examine and inspect  Sellers'  records  relating to
     Employees.


Section 2.7. Records and Data Processing, etc.
-----------  ---------------------------------

(a)  As  of  the  Effective  Time,   Purchasers  shall  become  responsible  for
     maintaining  the  files,  documents,   and  records  referred  to  in  this
     Agreement.  Purchasers  will  preserve  and  hold  them in  safekeeping  as
     required by applicable law and sound banking practice for the joint benefit
     of Sellers and Purchasers. After the Effective Time, Purchasers will permit
     Sellers and their  representatives,  for  reasonable  cause,  at reasonable
     times and upon reasonable notice, to examine,  inspect, copy, and reproduce
     any such files,  documents, or records as Sellers deem reasonably necessary

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     and to have similar  access to such records and Sellers'  former  employees
     for purposes of  preparation of records and reports  (including  regulatory
     and tax reports and  returns)  and as Sellers  require in  connection  with
     third party litigation.

(b)  As of  the  Effective  Time,  Sellers  will  permit  Purchasers  and  their
     representatives,  for  reasonable  cause,  at  reasonable  times  and  upon
     reasonable  notice,  to  examine,   inspect,  copy,  and  reproduce  files,
     documents,  or  records  retained  by  Sellers  regarding  the  assets  and
     liabilities  transferred under this Agreement as Purchasers deem reasonably
     necessary.

(c)  For a period of 180 days  after the  Effective  Time,  the party  providing
     copies of records shall do so without charge; thereafter, it may charge its
     customary rate for such copies.

(d)  It is understood that certain of Sellers' records,  including  certificates
     of deposit,  may be  available  only in  electronic  form or in the form of
     photocopies, film copies, or other non-original and non-paper media.

(e)  After the execution of this Agreement, Sellers will work with Purchasers to
     prepare mutually  satisfactory  schedules of Transferred  Assets to be sold
     hereunder.

-----------  --------

As of the  Effective  Time,  Purchasers  shall  be  solely  responsible  for the
security of and  insurance on all persons and  property  located in or about the
Banking Centers.

Section  2.9.  Taxes  and  Fees;  Proration  of  Certain  Expenses.
------------   ---------------------------------------------------

(a)  Purchasers shall not be responsible for, or have any liability with respect
     to,  taxes  on any  income  to  Sellers  arising  out of this  transaction.
     Purchasers shall not be responsible for any income tax liability of Sellers
     arising from the business or operations of the Banking  Centers  before the
     Effective   Time,  and  Sellers  shall  not  be  responsible  for  any  tax
     liabilities  of  Purchasers  arising from the business or operations of the
     Banking  Centers  after the Effective  Time.  All excise,  sales,  use, and
     transfer  taxes  that  are  payable  or  that  arise  as a  result  of  the
     consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be
     paid  one-half  by  Purchasers  and  one-half  by  Sellers,   and  each  of
     Purchasers,  on the  one-hand,  and  Sellers,  on  the  other  hand,  shall
     indemnify  and hold the other  harmless  from and against any such taxes in
     excess of the  portion to be paid by such other  party.  Utility  payments,
     telephone  charges,  real property taxes,  personal  property taxes,  rent,
     salaries,  deposit insurance  premiums or assessments,  maintenance  items,
     annual  assessments,  other  ordinary  operating  expenses  of the  Banking
     Centers,  and other expenses  related to the liabilities  assumed or assets
     purchased  hereunder  shall  be  prorated  between  the  parties  as of the
     Effective Time. To the extent any such item has been prepaid by Sellers for
     a  period   extending   beyond  the  Effective  Time,   there  shall  be  a
     proportionate monetary adjustment in favor of Sellers.  Purchasers shall be

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

     responsible for the payment of any non-delinquent special assessments. Real
     estate taxes shall be prorated,  based upon the maximum allowable  discount
     and other applicable exemptions.

(b)  Sellers and Purchasers  shall each be responsible  for their own costs with
     respect to the  preparation  and filing of any tax returns,  as well as the
     preparation,  review,  and analysis of the  allocation  statements  and any
     forms or statements prepared in connection with the allocation of the final
     purchase price.

Section 2.10. Title to Real Property.
------------  ----------------------

(a)  Sellers agree to deliver to Purchasers as soon as reasonably  possible upon
     Purchasers'  request  copies  of all title  information  in  possession  of
     Sellers,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  title  insurance  policies,
     attorneys'  opinions on title,  surveys,  covenants,  deeds,  and easements
     relating to the Real Property and the leased Banking Center location.  Such
     delivery  shall  constitute  no warranty  by Sellers as to the  accuracy or
     completeness thereof or that Purchasers are entitled to rely thereon.

(b)  Purchasers  shall have the right to obtain,  at  Purchasers'  sole cost and
     expense:

     (1)  a title insurance  commitment from a title insurance  company selected
          by  Purchasers  and an  owner's  policy  of title  insurance  insuring
          Purchasers'  title to the Real  Property  and  related  easements  and
          rights  appurtenant  thereto  for the Net  Book  Value of the land and
          buildings; and

     (2)  a survey as is  required  by the title  insurer  to remove  the survey
          exception in the title insurance policy, to be conducted by a surveyor
          selected by Purchasers.

(c)  Purchasers  agree to notify  Sellers,  in writing,  within 60 calendar days
     after  the date of this  Agreement,  of any  mortgages,  pledges,  material
     liens, encumbrances,  reservations,  tenancies, encroachments,  overlaps or
     other title exceptions,  survey  objections,  or zoning or similar land use
     violations   (excluding   legal  but   nonconforming   uses),  or  material
     engineering  or  structural  problems  related to the Real  Property or the
     leased Banking Center location to which Purchasers  reasonably  object (the
     "Title  Defects").  If  Purchasers  do not notify  Sellers of Title Defects
     within such time  period,  Purchasers  shall be deemed to have waived their
     rights  under this  Section  2.10 and Article IV as to such Title  Defects.
     Purchasers  agree that Title Defects shall not include real property  taxes
     not yet due and  payable  or  easements,  restrictions,  tenancies,  survey
     matters, or other title matters,  and rights of way which do not materially
     interfere  with the use of the Real Property or the leased  Banking  Center
     location   as  such   facilities   are   currently   utilized   ("Permitted
     Encumbrances";  the term  "Permitted  Encumbrances"  shall also include any
     title  defects,   deficiencies,   exceptions,   or  encumbrances  to  which
     Purchasers fail to object within said 60-day period, or to which Purchasers
     object within said 60-day period but which Sellers do not correct and which
     Purchasers  expressly  accept in writing).  Sellers shall make a good faith

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

     effort  to  correct  any  such  Title  Defect  to  Purchasers'   reasonable
     satisfaction  prior to the Closing Date;  provided,  however,  that Sellers
     shall not be  obligated  to bring any lawsuit or make any payments of money
     (except to pay liens that  Sellers do not  dispute in good faith) to cure a
     Title  Defect.  If Sellers  are  unable to cure any such  Title  Defects to
     Purchasers'  reasonable  satisfaction  prior  to  Closing,   Sellers  shall
     transfer  title with the uncured Title Defects to Purchasers and Purchasers
     shall be  entitled  to the  indemnification  provided  by  Article  IV with
     respect to any uncured Title Defects.

(d)  Purchasers shall have the right to request that the title insurance company
     update title  matters up to 10 business  days prior to the Closing Date for
     any changes  which may have arisen  between the date of the original  title
     search  and the  Closing  Date.  If such  update  indicates  that any Title
     Defects  have been placed of record or have come into  existence  since the
     date of Purchasers' original title search, and Purchasers reasonably object
     thereto in writing, then Sellers shall make a good faith effort to cure any
     such Title Defect to  Purchasers'  reasonable  satisfaction;  provided that
     Sellers shall not be obligated to bring any lawsuit or make any payments of
     money  (except to pay liens that  Sellers do not  dispute in good faith) to
     cure a Title  Defect.  If Sellers are unable to cure any such Title Defect,
     Sellers shall  transfer  title with the uncured Title Defects to Purchasers
     and Purchasers shall be entitled to the indemnification provided by Article
     IV with respect to any uncured Title Defects.

Section 2.11. Environmental Matters.
------------  ---------------------

(a)  Sellers agree to deliver to Purchasers as soon as reasonably possible, upon
     Purchasers'  request,  copies of all environmental  studies,  reports,  and
     audits in Sellers'  possession  related to the Banking Centers.  Sellers do
     not make any  representation or warranty regarding any aspect of any report
     delivered  to  Purchaser,  including  without  limitation,  the accuracy or
     completeness of the report, its preparation,  or any information upon which
     it is based. Any reliance on the report or any information contained in the
     report  shall be at  Purchaser's  risk.  Sellers  agree  to use  reasonable
     efforts  to  assist  Purchasers  in  obtaining  reliance  letters  from the
     environmental  consultants  or other  parties  that  issued  such  studies,
     reports,  or audits  that would  permit  Purchasers  to rely  thereon,  but
     Sellers shall not be obligated to incur any cost or liability in connection
     therewith.

(b)  Sellers authorize  Purchasers and/or their agents or contractors to contact
     governmental  agencies  regarding  the  environmental  status  of the  Real
     Property or the leased Banking  Center  location.  In addition,  Purchasers
     shall  have the  right,  but not the  obligation,  at their  sole  cost and
     expense,  to cause  such  investigations  and tests to be made as they deem
     necessary  to determine  whether  there has been any soil,  surface  water,
     groundwater,  or building space contamination on or under the Real Property
     or the leased Banking Center location;  provided, however, that without the
     prior written  consent of Sellers,  which consent will not  unreasonably be
     withheld,  and  execution  of a  satisfactory  property  access  agreement,
     Purchasers  shall  not  conduct  subsurface  testing  or any  ground  water
     monitoring,  install any test well,  or undertake  any other  investigation

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

     which  requires  a  permit  or  license  from,  or  the  reporting  of  the
     investigation  or the results  thereof  to, a local or state  environmental
     regulatory authority or the United States Environmental  Protection Agency.
     Sellers shall  provide  reasonable  assistance  to Purchasers  and/or their
     agents or contractors in their  evaluation and testing of the Real Property
     or the leased Banking Center location and Sellers shall provide  Purchasers
     and/or  their  agents  or  contractors  access  to  pertinent  records  and
     documents. Any tests performed by Purchasers shall be conducted in a manner
     so as not to  permanently  or  materially  damage the Real  Property or the
     leased Banking Center location.  If any damage is caused,  Purchasers shall
     immediately  repair and  restore the Real  Property  or the leased  Banking
     Center location to its former condition. Purchasers shall be responsible to
     Sellers for, and shall  indemnify,  defend,  and hold harmless Sellers from
     and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and causes of
     action  for  personal  injury  or  property  damage or loss to  persons  or
     property  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees) arising from such entry,
     use, or occupancy of the Real Property or leased Banking  Center  location,
     unless  caused by the sole  negligence  of Sellers.  This  indemnity  shall
     survive the Closing or  termination  of this  Agreement.  Purchasers  shall
     furnish Sellers with a copy of each report setting forth the results of any
     test  performed by  Purchasers  within ten days after  receipt.  Purchasers
     shall  not  submit a copy of any such  report  to any  governmental  agency
     unless  specifically  required by  applicable  law;  and,  if so  required,
     Purchasers  shall   simultaneously   provide  to  Sellers  a  copy  of  any
     information submitted to such agency.

          Purchasers  shall  report the  results of any such  investigations  or
     tests to Sellers no later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement. If
     Purchasers'  investigations  or tests reveal any  environmental  conditions
     that  would  cause a  reasonably  prudent  purchaser  to require a Phase II
     report to  determine  the  existence  of a Material  Adverse  Environmental
     Condition  (defined  below),  Sellers and Purchases agree to use good faith
     efforts to select a mutually acceptable environmental consultant as soon as
     possible  to  determine  whether  such a  condition  is a Material  Adverse
     Environmental  Condition  and agree to share  equally the cost of retaining
     the consultant for such purpose. "Material Adverse Environmental Condition"
     means an  environmental  condition  that is reasonably  likely to cost more
     than $75,000 to remediate to a commercial  use  standard,  as determined by
     such environmental consultant. If Purchasers object to any Material Adverse
     Environmental  Condition which impacts the Banking  Centers,  Sellers shall
     have the right,  but not the obligation,  to cure any such Material Adverse
     Environmental  Condition.  If Sellers are unable or  unwilling to cure such
     problem prior to the Effective  Time,  Sellers shall  transfer title to the
     Banking Center with the uncured Material Adverse Environmental Condition to
     Purchasers and Purchasers shall be entitled to the indemnification provided
     by Article IV with respect to such uncured Material  Adverse  Environmental
     Condition.

Section 2.12. Brokerage Account Agreements.
------------  ----------------------------

Sellers will cause HIC to use reasonable  efforts to transfer and assign,  as of
the Effective Date, the Brokerage Account  Agreements and all of HIC's rights to
or  interest  in any  commissions  or income  arising  from the sale of products
pursuant  to such  Brokerage  Account  Agreements  and  not  paid  prior  to the
Effective  Time to a replacement  broker-dealer  designated  by  Purchasers  and
acceptable to Sellers, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such
transfer and assignment of the Brokerage  Account  Agreements will be subject to
such  replacement  broker-dealer  assuming,  as of the  Effective  Date, in form
satisfactory  to Seller's  counsel,  all duties,  obligations,  and  liabilities
related to  Brokerage  Account  Agreements  accruing  or arising on or after the
Effective  Date.  To the extent  allowable  under  applicable  law,  rules,  and
regulations,  Sellers  will  provide  the  current  customer  lists and  account
holdings of such  Brokerage  Account  Agreements  in such formats as  reasonably
requested by Purchasers,  provided that such format is readily available to HIC,
and HIC will execute such consents as may be reasonably  required to effect such
transfer  and  assignment.  No party shall be required to take any action  under
this Section 2.12 that is inconsistent  with any applicable state,  federal,  or
local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations,  any  NASD or  other  SRO  rules or rule
interpretation, or HIC's policies and procedures.

     all  Closing   documents   have  been   received   and  are   satisfactory,
     respectively,  and that the parties'  wire  transfer(s)  of funds  required

     which a dispute exists.  Any disputed amounts retained by a party which are
     later  found to be due to the other party shall be paid to such other party
     promptly upon resolution  with interest  thereon from the Effective Time to
     the date paid at the applicable Federal Funds Rate.

(c)  The Federal  Funds Rate shall be the mean of the high and low rates  quoted
     for  Federal  Funds in the Money Rates  column of The Wall  Street  Journal
     adjusted as such mean may  increase or decrease  during the period  between
     the Effective Time and the date paid.


                          ARTICLE IV - INDEMNIFICATION
                          ----------------------------

Section   4.1.   Huntington's   Indemnification   of   Purchasers.
-------------    ------------------------------------------------

(a)  Subject to any  limitations in this Section 4.1,  Section 4.4, or otherwise
     contained in this Agreement, Huntington shall indemnify, hold harmless, and
     defend  Purchasers  from and  against  (i) any  breach  by  Sellers  of any
     representation  or  warranty   contained  herein,   (ii)  claims,   losses,
     liabilities, demands, and obligations, including reasonable attorneys' fees
     and expenses,  whether or not involving a third-party  claim, and including
     costs of cleanup, containment, or other remediation,  relating to any Title
     Defect or Material Adverse  Environmental  Condition  existing prior to the
     Effective  Time  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  2.10(c)  or  (d) or
     paragraph 2.11(b), and (iii) all claims, losses, liabilities,  demands, and
     obligations, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, arising out
     of any actions, suits, or proceedings commenced prior to the Effective Time
     (other  than  proceedings  to  prevent  or limit the  consummation  of this
     transaction) relating to Sellers' operations at the Banking Centers. Except
     as  otherwise   provided  in  this  Agreement,   Huntington  shall  further
     indemnify,  hold  harmless,  and defend  Purchasers  from and  against  all
     claims, losses, liabilities, demands, and obligations, including reasonable
     attorneys' fees and expenses, real estate taxes,  intangibles and franchise
     taxes,  sales and use taxes,  social security and  unemployment  taxes, all
     accounts payable,  and operating expenses (including  salaries,  rents, and
     utility charges)  incurred by Sellers prior to the Effective Time and which
     are claimed or demanded on or after the Effective  Time, or which arise out
     of any actions,  suits, or proceedings  commenced on or after the Effective
     Time and which relate to Sellers' operations or transactions at the Banking
     Centers prior to the Effective Time.

(b)  The  Purchasers'  sole  remedy  for a  breach  of the  representations  and
     warranties contained in Section 5.11 shall be to require the Sellers to (i)
     purchase  any Loans  which  Purchasers  in good faith  deem to breach  such
     representation  and warranty at the principal amount thereof,  plus accrued
     and unpaid interest,  late charges,  and any other charges thereon, in each
     case  as of  the  time  of  the  applicable  purchase,  or  (ii)  indemnify
     Purchasers in accordance with the other provisions of this Article IV, with


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

     Sellers having the right to choose between such measures.  The remedies set
     forth in this paragraph 4.1(b) can be exercised only for a period ending on
     the earlier of 60 days after  discovery  of such breach or 12 months  after
     the  Closing  Date.  Alternatively,  the  parties  may agree to extend that
     exercise  period with  respect to a  particular  Loan or group of Loans and
     permit  Purchasers to continue  their  customary  processing and collection
     efforts with respect to such Loans.

Section 4.2. Purchasers' Indemnification of Sellers.
-----------  --------------------------------------

Purchasers shall indemnify,  hold harmless,  and defend Sellers from and against
any breach by Purchasers of any  representation or warranty contained herein and
all claims, losses, liabilities, demands, and obligations,  including reasonable
attorneys'  fees and  expenses,  real estate  taxes,  intangibles  and franchise
taxes, sales and use taxes, social security and unemployment taxes, all accounts
payable,  and  operating  expenses  (including  salaries,   rents,  and  utility
charges),  which any of Sellers may receive, suffer, or incur in connection with
operations and transactions occurring after the Effective Time and which involve
the Banking  Centers,  the Transferred  Assets,  or the  liabilities  assumed by
Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 4.3. Claims for Indemnity.
-----------  --------------------

(a)  A claim for indemnity  under  Sections 4.1 or 4.2 of this  Agreement may be
     made by the  claiming  party at any time prior to (i) 120 months  after the
     Effective  Time in case of a claim under  Section  4.1(a)(ii),  and (ii) 24
     months  after the  Effective  Time for all other  items,  by the  giving of
     written  notice  thereof to the other party.  Such written notice shall set
     forth in reasonable detail the basis upon which such claim for indemnity is
     made.  In the  event  that any such  claim is made  within  the  prescribed
     period, the indemnity relating to such claim shall survive until such claim
     is  resolved.  Claims  not made  within  such  period  shall  cease  and no
     indemnity shall be made therefor.

(b)  In  the  event  that  any  individual,  association,  corporation,  limited
     liability company, partnership, limited liability partnership, trust, firm,
     or other entity (a "Person") not a party to this  Agreement  shall make any
     demand or claim or file or  threaten  to file any  lawsuit,  which  demand,
     claim, or lawsuit may result in any liability, damage, or loss to one party
     hereto of the kind for which  such  party is  entitled  to  indemnification
     pursuant  to Section  4.1 or 4.2  hereof,  then,  after  written  notice is
     provided by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party of such demand,
     claim, or lawsuit,  the  indemnifying  party shall have the option,  at its
     cost and expense, to retain counsel for the indemnified party to defend any
     such demand,  claim, or lawsuit.  In the event that the indemnifying  party
     shall fail to  respond  within  five  calendar  days after  receipt of such
     notice of any such demand,  claim, or lawsuit,  then the indemnified  party
     shall  retain  counsel and conduct the defense of such  demand,  claim,  or
     lawsuit as it may in their discretion deem proper,  at the cost and expense
     of the indemnifying  party. In effecting the settlement of any such demand,
     claim,  or lawsuit,  an  indemnified  party shall act in good faith,  shall
     consult  with the  indemnifying  party,  and  shall  enter  into  only such

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

     settlement  as the  indemnifying  party  shall  approve  (the  indemnifying
     party's approval will be implied if it does not respond within ten calendar
     days of their receipt of the notice of such settlement offer).


Section 4.4. Limitations on Indemnification and Survival.
-----------  -------------------------------------------

(a)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in this Article IV, no
     indemnification  shall be  required  to be made by either  party  until the
     aggregate amount of all such claims by a party exceeds $100,000.  Once such
     aggregate amount exceeds  $100,000,  such party shall thereupon be entitled
     to indemnification for all amounts in excess of such $100,000. IN ADDITION,
     THE  PARTIES  SHALL  HAVE NO  OBLIGATIONS  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE  IV FOR ANY

-----------  ---------------------

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Huntington and HNB and is

Section 5.5. No Brokers.

All negotiations  relative to this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby have been carried on by Huntington and Purchasers,  and there has been no
participation  or  intervention by any other Person employed or engaged by or on
behalf of  Sellers in such a manner as to give rise to any valid  claim  against
Sellers  or  Purchasers  for a  brokerage  commission,  finder's  fee,  or  like
commission.

Section 5.6. Personal Property.
-----------  -----------------

Sellers  own,  and will convey to  Purchasers  at the  Closing,  all of Sellers'
right, title, and interest to all of the Personal Property free and clear of any

good working  order other than items that are not material or items that do not,
in the aggregate, exceed $25,000 in value.

Section 5.7. Real Property and Leased Banking Center.
-----------  ---------------------------------------

Sellers  make  the  following  additional  representations  regarding  the  Real
Property and the leased Banking Center:

(a)  Except as specifically  set forth herein,  Sellers have no knowledge of any
     condemnation  proceedings  pending  against the Real Property or the leased
     Banking Center location.

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

(b)  Except as specifically set forth herein,  Sellers have not entered into any
     agreement  regarding  the  Real  Property  or  the  leased  Banking  Center
     location,  and to  Seller's  knowledge  the Real  Property  and the  leased
     Banking Center location are not subject to any claim,  demand,  suit, lien,
     proceeding, or litigation of any kind, pending or outstanding,  which would
     materially  affect  or  limit  Purchasers'  use and  enjoyment  of the Real
     Property or the leased  Banking Center  location or which would  materially
     limit or restrict  Sellers'  right or ability to enter into this  Agreement
     and consummate the sale and purchase contemplated hereby.

(c)  To Sellers'  knowledge,  (i) no fact or condition exists which would result
     in the permanent  termination or material  impairment of access to the Real
     Property  or the Leased  Banking  Center  location  from  adjoining  public
     streets  or  highways  or in  the  permanent  discontinuance  of  necessary
     utilities  services  to the Real  Property  or the  Leased  Banking  Center
     location, and (ii) all sanitation,  plumbing,  refuse disposal, and similar
     facilities  servicing the Banking  Centers are in material  compliance with
     applicable governmental regulations.

(d)  No  complaints  have been received by Sellers that Sellers are in violation
     of  applicable  building,  zoning,  platting,   subdivision,  use,  safety,
     building, or similar laws, ordinances,  regulations,  and restrictions with
     respect to the Banking Centers. To Sellers' knowledge, there are no special
     or general  assessments pending against or affecting the Real Property and,
     to Sellers' knowledge, no public improvements have been recently made which
     would cause special or general  assessments to be assessed against the Real
     Property.  Except for any encroachment which does not materially affect the
     use or  value  of the  premises:  (i) to  Sellers'  knowledge,  there is no
     encroachment upon the Real Property from any buildings or improvements,  if
     any,  located on the  adjacent  property;  and (ii) to Sellers'  knowledge,
     there is no encroachment by the Real Property upon any adjacent property or
     upon any  easements  with  respect to the adjacent  property.  There are no
     leases or other  agreements by which any Person possesses or has a right to
     possess all or any portion of the Real Property other than those  described
     in this Agreement or exhibits to this Agreement. To Sellers' knowledge, and
     except as disclosed  by title  insurance  binder or by survey,  there is no
     violation of any applicable building  restriction or restrictive  covenant.
     To Sellers'  knowledge,  the Real  Property is  adequately  serviced by all
     utilities  necessary  for  effective  operation  as  presently  used  for a
     financial institution office.

Until  the  Closing  Date,   Purchasers'   sole  remedy  for  a  breach  of  the
representations  and  warranties  in this  Section  5.7 shall be as  provided in

                                      -25-

or  representations  whatsoever,  except  as may  be  expressly  represented  or
warranted in this Agreement.

Section 5.9. Employees.
-----------  ---------

No Employee  located in any of the Banking  Centers is a party to any collective
bargaining,  employment,  severance, termination, or change of control agreement
or  represented  by a  labor  organization  of  any  type  other  than  Sellers'
established terms of employment and severance  policies.  Sellers are unaware of
any efforts during the past three years to unionize or organize the employees of
any of the  Banking  Centers.  Sellers  will  provide to  Purchasers  a true and
correct list of all employees of the Banking Centers as of the date hereof,  and
a list of any and all bonus or incentive or other  compensation  arrangements or
commitments,  other than benefits plans applicable to all Huntington  employees,
for each such employee or for the employees as a group. Purchasers agree to keep
such  information  in  strictest  confidence  and to confine  knowledge  of such
information  to those of their  officers and  personnel  who have a need to know
such information in connection with the performance of their duties. None of the
employees of the Banking Centers is a party to any employment  contract,  formal
or informal,  oral or written,  or represented  under any collective  bargaining
agreement relating to employment with Sellers.

Section 5.10. Assumed Contracts.
------------  -----------------

Sellers  have  delivered to  Purchasers  a true and  complete  copy of each Real
Property Lease,  Equipment Lease, Software License,  Safe Deposit Contract,  and
Operating  Contract  that is to be assumed  by  Purchasers.  Each Real  Property
Lease,  Equipment Lease, Software License, Safe Deposit Contract,  and Operating
Contract  is valid and  subsisting  and in full force and effect.  Sellers  have
performed in all material  respects all obligations  required to be performed by
Sellers thereunder and no condition exists which constitutes or, with notice, or
lapse of time,  would  constitute  a material  default  thereunder.  To Sellers'
knowledge,  all other parties to each Real Property  Lease,  Equipment Lease and
Software  License  have  performed  in all  material  respects  all  obligations
required to be  performed  by such parties  thereunder  and no condition  exists
which constitutes or, with notice, or lapse of time, would constitute a material
default thereunder by such other parties.

Section 5.11. Loans.
------------  -----

(a)  Each Loan was made in the ordinary  course of business,  has been  properly
     executed  by  the  parties  thereto,   represents  the  valid  and  binding
     obligation of the obligor,  enforceable by the holder thereof in accordance
     with its terms,  is free from any  material  defenses,  contains  customary
     enforcement  provisions  such that the  rights and  remedies  of the holder
     thereof are adequate for enforcement of the Loans,  and, unless approved by
     Sellers and documented in their files, no material  provision of a Loan has
     been waived.

(b)  Each Loan  (such term to  include,  for  purposes  of this  paragraph,  the
     principal  documents  relating in any way to such Loans,  including  notes,
     mortgages,  security  instruments,  and  guarantees)  complies and has been

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

     administered in all material  respects with all  requirements of applicable
     federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

(c)  Each Loan that is secured by collateral is secured by a perfected  mortgage
     or security  interest in the collateral in favor of Sellers as mortgagee or
     secured party and having the priority as documented in Sellers'  files.  No
     collateral  has been  released  from the lien  granted to  Sellers,  unless
     approved by Sellers and documented in their files.

(d)  No  selection  procedures  believed to be adverse to  Purchasers  have been
     utilized by Sellers in selecting the Loans.

(e)  Except as may be otherwise  specifically  set forth in this Agreement,  all
     Loans (such term to include, for purposes of this paragraph,  the principal
     documents  relating in any way to such Loans,  including notes,  mortgages,
     security instruments,  and guarantees)  transferred to Purchasers hereunder
     are  transferred  "AS IS, WHERE IS," with no warranties or  representations
     whatsoever,  except as may be  expressly  represented  or warranted in this
     Section 5.11.  Purchasers' sole remedy for a breach of the  representations
     and  warranties  in this  Section  5.11 shall be as provided  in  paragraph
     4.1(b).

Section 5.12. Environmental Matters.
------------  ---------------------

Except as previously disclosed to Purchasers in writing, to the actual knowledge
of the Executive  Officers of Sellers or the senior property  management officer
for the geographic region in which the Banking Centers are located,  and without
any investigation by such officers:

(a)  Each Banking Center is, in all material  respects,  in compliance  with all
     applicable federal, state, local, or municipal statutes,  ordinance,  laws,
     and regulations and all orders,  rulings,  or other decisions of any court,
     administrative  agency, or any other governmental authority relating to the
     protection of the environment.

(b)  No Banking  Center is  constructed  of, nor does it contain as a  component
     part,  any material  (either in its present form or as it may reasonably be
     expected to change  through  aging or normal use) which  reasonably  can be
     expected to release any substance,  whether  gaseous,  liquid,  or solid or
     that is known to be (either by single  exposure or by repeated or prolonged
     exposure)  injurious or hazardous  to the health of persons  occupying  the
     premises or is a Hazardous Substance (defined below).  Without limiting the
     generality  of this  Section,  each  Banking  Center  is,  and  during  all
     applicable  limitation  periods has been,  to Sellers'  knowledge,  free of
     asbestos except to the extent properly sealed or encapsulated in compliance
     with all applicable  Environmental  Laws (defined below) and all work-place
     safety,  disability and health laws,  regulations,  and guidelines so as to
     completely prevent the escape of asbestos particles or fibers.

(c)  During Sellers' ownership and operation,  no part of any Banking Center has
     been used for the manufacture,  handling, storage, or disposal of Hazardous
     Substances,  except for conventional  cleaning and maintenance materials in

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

     quantities  customary for commercial  operations of the nature conducted by
     Sellers at such Banking Center.

(d)  Except as disclosed in writing to Purchasers,  no Banking Center  contains,
     nor has ever  contained,  an  "underground  storage  tank" as that  term is
     defined in the Federal  Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 to the
     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

(e)  There is no action,  suit,  investigation,  inquiry,  or other  proceeding,
     ruling,  order, or citation  involving  Sellers,  pending,  threatened,  or
     previously  asserted as a result of any actual or alleged failure to comply
     with any requirement of any Environmental  Laws with respect to any Banking
     Centers,  and there is no factual basis for any of the  foregoing.  Sellers
     have not received a notice that they are a  potentially  responsible  party
     under any state or federal Environmental Law.

(f)  Neither  Seller is an "owner or operator"  of a "facility"  or "vessel," as
     those terms are defined in Section 9601 of the Comprehensive  Environmental
     Response  Compensation  and  Liability  Act of 1980,  42 U.S.C.A.  ss. 9601
     ("CERCLA"),  thereby  owning,  possessing,  transporting,   generating,  or
     disposing of any Hazardous Substances in relation to any Banking Center.

For  purposes  of this  Section  5.12,  "Hazardous  Substances"  has the meaning
defined in Section 9601 of CERCLA,  and includes  any  substance  that is now or
hereafter  regulated  by or  subject  to any  Environmental  Laws and any  other
pollutant,  contaminant,  or waste,  including,  without  limitation,  asbestos,
radon,  polychlorinated  biphenyls,  and petroleum products;  and "Environmental
Laws" mean all laws  (civil or  common),  ordinances,  rules,  regulations,  and
orders that: (i) regulate  solid waste  management,  including the  containment,
storage,  handling,   transportation,   disposal,  or  management  of  Hazardous
Substances;  (ii) regulate or prescribe  requirements  for air,  water,  or soil
quality; (iii) are intended to protect public health or the environment; or (iv)
establish  liability for the  investigation,  removal,  or cleanup of, or damage
caused by, any Hazardous  Substances.  Until the Closing Date,  Purchasers' sole
remedy for a breach of the  representations  and warranties in this Section 5.12
shall be as provided in Section 2.11(b).

Section 5.13. Deposit Liabilities.
------------  -------------------

No selection  procedures believed to be adverse to Purchasers have been utilized
by Sellers in selecting the Deposit  Liabilities.  The Deposit  Liabilities  are
insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by federal law and no action
is pending or has been  threatened  by the FDIC against  Sellers with respect to
the  termination of such  insurance.  Sellers are classified 1-A for purposes of
calculating  FDIC  Insurance  premiums.  To  Sellers'  knowledge,   the  Deposit
Liabilities  (i) are in all  respects  genuine and  enforceable  obligations  of
Sellers  and have been  acquired  and  maintained  in full  compliance  with all
applicable  Laws,  including  but not  limited to the Truth in  Savings  Act and
regulations promulgated thereunder; (ii) were acquired in the ordinary course of

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

Sellers' business;  and (iii) are not subject to any claims with respect to such
Deposit  Liabilities  that are  superior  to the rights of persons  shown on the
records   delivered  to  Purchasers   indicating   the  owners  of  the  Deposit
Liabilities,  other than claims against such Deposit Liabilities owners, such as
state and federal tax liens, garnishments, and other judgment claims, which have
matured or may mature into claims against the respective Deposit Liabilities.

Section 5.14. Books, Records, Documentation, etc.
------------  ----------------------------------

The  books and  records  of the  Banking  Centers  are  correct,  accurate,  and
complete,  in all material respects,  have been maintained in a consistent and a
customary manner, and are in material compliance with all applicable federal and
state laws and regulations  and customary  banking  practices.  The deposit- and
lending-related forms, notices,  statements, and related documentation,  as well
as Sellers' policies,  procedures,  and practices with respect thereto,  used at
the Banking Centers comply in all material respects with applicable  federal and
state laws and regulations and customary banking practices.

Section 5.15. Litigation.
------------  ----------

There are no actions,  causes of action, claims, suits, or proceedings,  pending
or, to Sellers' knowledge,  threatened,  against Sellers relating to the Banking
Centers or materially  affecting the Banking Centers,  whether at law, in equity
or before or by a governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency, or
instrumentality.  For purposes of this  section,  claims will be  considered  to
materially  affect the Banking  Centers if the  aggregate  amount of such claims
exceeds $10,000.

Section 5.16. Tax Matters.
------------  -----------

Sellers have  complied with the  requirements  of the Internal  Revenue  Service
regarding taxpayer  identification  number  certification,  interest information
reporting, and backup withholding of interest payable in connection with Deposit
Liabilities.  Sellers have filed all federal,  state, county, local, and foreign
tax  returns,  including  information  returns,  required to be filed by them in
connection  with Sellers'  operation of the Banking  Centers,  and have paid all
taxes  owed by  them,  including  those  with  respect  to  withholding,  social
security,  unemployment,  workers compensation,  franchise, ad valorem, premium,
excise,  and sales  taxes,  and no taxes  shown on such  returns or  assessments
received  by them are  delinquent.  Sellers  have paid all taxes  which they are
required to withhold  from amounts  owing to  employees,  creditors,  holders of
Deposit  Liabilities,  or other third parties.  For all completed years, Sellers
have duly and timely sent to each holder of Deposit  Liabilities a Form 1099 (or
a substitute form permitted by law) relating to interest, earnings, or dividends
paid on such accounts for those periods.

Section 5.17. Limitation and Survival of Representations and Warranties.
------------  ---------------------------------------------------------

Except as may be expressly  represented or warranted in this Agreement,  neither
Huntington nor any other Seller makes any representation or warranty  whatsoever
with regard to any asset being  transferred  to  Purchasers  or any liability or

                                      -29-

Sellers  shall  afford  to  the  officers  and  authorized   representatives  of
Purchasers,  upon prior  notice  and  subject to  Huntington's  normal  security
requirements,  access to the properties,  books,  and records  pertaining to the
Banking Centers, specifically including but not limited to all books and records
relating to the  Deposit  Liabilities,  the Loans,  the Real  Property,  and the

Section 7.5. No Solicitation by Sellers.
-----------  --------------------------

(a)  After the execution of this Agreement,  Sellers will take reasonable  steps
     to avoid causing Banking Centers customers to transfer all or part of their
     Deposit  or Loan  business  from the  Banking  Centers.  For a period of 24
     months after the Closing  Date,  Sellers will not  establish any new branch
     facility or install any automated  teller  machines at any location  within
     Berkeley County; provided, however, that this restriction will not apply to
     any branch  existing as of the date of this Agreement nor prohibit  Sellers
     from acquiring a branch facility or automated  teller machine as part of an
     acquisition  of another bank or bank holding  company that has at least 85%
     of their  total  deposits  attributed  to branch  offices  located  outside
     Berkeley County. As of the date of this Agreement,  Sellers do not have any
     plans to make any such acquisitions, but Sellers may make such acquisitions
     in the future.  In  addition,  for a period of 24 months  after the Closing
     Date, Sellers will not specifically target or solicit customers assigned to
     the Banking Centers;  provided,  however,  that this restriction  shall not
     restrict general mass mailings,  telemarketing  calls,  statement stuffers,
     and other similar  communications  directed to all the current customers of
     Sellers or Sellers'  affiliates,  or to the public or newspaper,  radio, or
     television  advertisements of a general nature or otherwise prevent Sellers
     from taking such  actions as may be required to comply with any  applicable
     federal or state laws,  rules,  or regulations.  The foregoing  restriction
     shall not restrict the ability of Sellers or any of their  affiliates from:
     (i) engaging in the lines of business excluded from the Transferred Assets,
     namely,  the Dealer Sales line of business,  the Mortgage Loan  Origination
     line of business,  the Merchant  Card  Services  line of business,  and the
     Credit Card  Program,  and (ii)  soliciting  customers  whose  accounts are
     normally  established  or  maintained  in offices  other  than the  Banking
     Centers.  In addition,  it is understood  and agreed that the  restrictions
     contained  in this  paragraph  7.5(a) shall not be binding upon or apply to
     any Person who merges,  consolidates,  or otherwise becomes affiliated with
     Sellers, or any of such Persons' affiliates or successors, as a result of a
     business   combination   transaction   where  such   business   combination
     transaction  was not undertaken for the primary  purpose of re-entering the
     retail and corporate  branch banking business within the area restricted by
     this  paragraph  7.5(a).  The  obligations of the parties  hereunder  shall
     specifically survive the Closing for a period of 24 months.

(b)  In order to facilitate  Sellers'  compliance with the  restrictions in this
     Section 7.5,  Purchasers  will give prompt notice to Sellers of any mailing
     or other form of marketing that it determines is not  consistent  with such
     restrictions.

Section 7.6. Efforts to Consummate; Further Actions.

such  instruments  and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably
require in order to carry out the  intent of this  Agreement.  Included  in such
actions shall be the execution and delivery of additional powers of attorney and
such  other  documents  and  instruments  as shall be  prepared  and  reasonably

                                      -33-

to this transaction. Sellers shall make no charge to the Purchasers for Sellers'

-----------  ---------------------------

If the assignment of any material claim, contract,  license, lease,  commitment,
sales order,  or purchase  order (or any material  claim or right or any benefit
arising  thereunder)  without the consent of a third  party would  constitute  a
breach  thereof  or  materially  affect  the  rights of  Purchasers  or  Sellers
thereunder,  then  such  assignment  will be made  subject  to such  consent  or
approval being obtained.
