     (iv) Section 9 of the Credit Agreement is amended in its entirety to
          provide as follows:

         "9. FINANCIAL COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER.

         The Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any Revolving Credit
Loan or any Revolving Credit Note is outstanding or any Bank has any obligation
to make any Revolving Credit Loans:

         9.1 Consolidated Total Net Worth. The Borrower will maintain, at all
times, a Consolidated Net Worth in an amount equal to at least $185,000,000.

         9.2 Profitable Operations. For the fiscal quarter of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries ending on December 31, 2001 the Consolidated Net Income of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall not be less than ($500,000), and for each
fiscal quarter thereafter, the Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall not be less than $1.00. For the fiscal quarter ending on
December 31, 2001, the Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for such fiscal quarter may be calculated without reference to the
amount of the one-time loss associated with the SPI Sale (provided that such
loss shall not be in excess of $18,000,000).

         9.3 Leverage Ratio. For the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2001,
March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002, the Borrower will not permit the Leverage
Ratio, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, to exceed 9.56:1.00, 2.86:1.00
and 2.15:1.00, respectively. For each such quarter, the Leverage Ratio will be
calculated after adding back one-time charges.

         9.4 Minimum Consolidated EBITDA. The Borrower will maintain, as of the
last day of each fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2002, Consolidated EBITDA as
determined on a quarterly and fiscal year cumulative basis in amounts at least
equal to the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Fiscal Quarter    Fiscal Quarter   Fiscal Quarter
                            Ending 12/31/01    Ending 3/31/02   Ending 6/30/02
                            ---------------    --------------   --------------
================================================================================
For the relevant fiscal
quarter:                       $1,500,000        $4,800,000       $6,200,000

Cumulative for the 2002        $4,741,000        $9,541,000       $15,741,000
fiscal year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2001
in which the SPI Sale is accounted for, an amount equal to the one-time loss
associated with such SPI Sale (but in no event greater than $18,000,000) shall
be deducted from each of the Consolidated EBITDA target figures set forth above
and for each fiscal quarter thereafter.

         9.5 Interest Coverage Ratio. The Borrower will not permit, as of the
last day of the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and
June 30, 2002, the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest
Expense for such fiscal quarter, to be less than 1.31:1.00, 4.09:1.00 and
5.06:1.00, respectively.

         9.6 Capital Expenditures. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries will not
make in the aggregate Capital Expenditures in excess of the amount set forth
below for the period corresponding thereto:

                        Period                         Amount
                        ------                         ------
                 7/1/01 to 12/31/01                  $2,700,000
                 7/1/01 to 3/31/02                   $3,500,000
                 7/1/01 to 6/30/02                   $4,200,000

Except as otherwise specified, the calculation of all financial covenants set
forth in this ss.9 shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting
