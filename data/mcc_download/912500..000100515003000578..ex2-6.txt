H.   In connection with the acquisition from Bema by Crystallex of all of Bema's
shares of capital stock in and other related assets of El Callao pursuant to a
Purchase Agreement between Bema and Crystallex, dated September 12, 2000, and
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement among Bema, as assignor,
Crystallex, as assignee, and El Callao, dated as of February 26, 2001 (the "BEMA
ASSIGNMENT");

     (i)   Bema assigned to Crystallex all of Bema's right title and interest in
and to: (a) the Bema Loan Agreement, (b) all indebtedness of El Callao to Bema
(consisting of US$13,307,028.54 and C$2,346,684.43 as of the date of the Bema
Assignment) under and pursuant to the Bema Loan Agreement (all such
indebtedness, as existing on the date of this Assignment and as it may exist and
be constituted at any time subsequent to the date of this Assignment, the "BEMA
DEBT"), (c) the ECM Guarantee, (d) the ECM Pledge Agreement, (e) the Osmin
Pledge Agreement, (f) the Tamanaco Pledge Agreement and (g) all benefits and
advantages (the "BEMA BENEFITS") to be derived from the Loan Agreement, the ECM
Guarantee, the ECM Pledge Agreement, the Osmin Pledge Agreement and the Tamanaco
Pledge Agreement (collectively, the "BEMA ASSIGNED AGREEMENTS");

     (ii)   Crystallex agreed to assume, observe, perform and be bound by the
Bema Assigned Agreements and the obligations of Bema thereunder (the "BEMA
OBLIGATIONS"), and to indemnify Bema for the non-payment, non-observance or
non-payment by Crystallex under the Bema Assigned Agreements and such
obligations (such indemnification and the Bema Obligations, collectively, the
"CRYSTALLEX OBLIGATIONS");

     (iii)   El Callao: (a) consented to the Bema Assignment and the assumption
by Crystallex of the Bema Obligations, (b) accepted the covenant of Crystallex
to observe, perform and be bound by the Bema Obligations, (c) agreed to perform
its obligations in the Bema Assigned Agreements and (d) released and discharged
Bema from the Bema Assigned Agreements and the Bema Obligations.

I.   Borrower would be or become in default of its obligations under the Credit
Agreement if the Lender, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent did
not enter into the First Amendment (and particularly Section 7 thereof relating
to a revised schedule for the repayment of the Loans made by the Lender pursuant
to the Credit Agreement), which provides for and obligates Crystallex, El
Callao, ECM, Osmin and Tamanaco to the matters provided in this Assignment and
in other agreements and documents provided for in the First Amendment. Such
default would seriously impair the operations and obligations of Crystallex, El
Callao, ECM, Osmin and Tamanaco, including, without limitation, the processing
of gold by their direct and indirect subsidiaries at the mill owned and operated
by Revemin.

J.   Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Assignor is obligated to, and wishes
to, assign to the Assignee (for the benefit of the Lender and any additional
Lenders), all of its right, title and interest in and to the Bema Loan
Agreement, the Bema Debt, the Bema Benefits, the Bema Assigned Agreements and
the Bema Assignment, and El Callao and ECM wish to consent to such assignment
and make certain covenants, agreements, representations and warranties to the
Assignee, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Assignment.

                                   AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the First Amendment and the benefits to be
derived by the Assignor, El Callao, ECM and the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities
therefrom; other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
acknowledged by the Assignor, El Callao and ECM; and intending to be legally
bound; the Assignor, El Callao and ECM (each sometimes referred to herein as a
"CRYSTALLEX PARTY" and collectively, the "CRYSTALLEX PARTIES") hereby agree with
and to and for the benefit of the Assignee, acting on behalf of the Lenders, as
follows:

warranties in Section 7, are subject to the relevant terms, conditions and

the right to the Assignee, its agents or attorneys, to collect, sue for, settle,

thereunder of the parties thereto, and to avail itself of and pursue all
remedies for the enforcement of the Assigned Interests and Assignor's rights in
and under the Assigned Interests as the Assignor might have pursued but for this
Assignment.

7.   PROJECT FINANCING; REPAYMENT OF BEMA DEPT; OSMIN AND TAMANACO.

     (a)   The Crystallex Parties agree with and represent and warrant to the
Assignee that:

          (i)   Corporacion Vengroup S.A. ("VENGROUP") is the owner of all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Osmin not owned by ECM (e.g. 49%);

          (ii)   ECM and Vengroup have entered into a shareholders' agreement as
to Osmin, dated July 27, 1993, and amended November 20, 2000 (as amended, the
"OSMIN SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT"), which provides, inter alia, for the provision
of "PROJECT FINANCING" (as defined in the Osmin Shareholder's Agreement and
subject to the provisions of Section 7(a)(v)), the pledge as security of the
assets of Osmin and its wholly owned subsidiary, Auriferous El Callao C. A., and
any of their respective subsidiaries, and the subordination and postponement of
the respective interests of ECM and Vengroup in Osmin in support of such Project
Financing;

          (iii)   Project Financing is essential to the development of Osmin and
assets owned by Osmin and its subsidiaries and it is contemplated that Project
Financing will be placed by Osmin while this Assignment remains in effect, which
Project Financing will include participation by the Assignor, El Callao, ECM,
and the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities, or any of them, and may include the
subordination and postponement of the indebtedness of any of the Osmin/Tamanaco
Entities to ECM and related security;

          (iv)   Project Financing shall not be entered into without the prior
written consent of the Assignee; and

          (v)   Such Project Financing will be on and subject to the following
terms and conditions;

               (A)   such Project financing shall be for the purpose of
               expanding, improving or enhancing gold mining and processing
               capabilities and facilities of the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities or any
               one of them;

               (B)   the Assignor shall provide or cause to be provided to the
               Assignee true and complete copies of all non-binding term sheets
               and/or letters of intent, all proposed agreements and documents
               and such other information as may be necessary for or requested
               by the Assignee to exercise its right of consent; and

               (C)   the then current Base Case model defined and provided in
               accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement shall, in the
               opinion of the Assignee, acting reasonably, support the repayment
               of the Project Financing in accordance with it's terms and
               repayment to the Assignee of all obligations and liabilities
               under and pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement.

     (b)   In the Assignor's reasonable judgment, the most business and tax
efficient manner for the Assignor to receive distribution of net cash available
for distribution under the Osmin Shareholders Agreement is by repayment of the
Bema Debt, which repayment will be enhanced by Project Financing in accordance
with the terms of Section 7(a). Accordingly, the Crystallex Parties covenant and
agree that upon the effectiveness of Section 10(b), any distributions then due
and thereafter accruing and received by any of them, directly or indirectly, or
to which they may be entitled, under the Osmin Shareholder's Agreement, shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the Assignee and immediately delivered to the
Assignee, which distributions shall be applied to the payment of the Bema Debt
and any amounts due under the Amended Credit Agreement.

     (c)   The Crystallex Parties and Vengroup are presently in negotiations to:
(i) merge and/or consolidate the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities into Osmin and/or Osmin
and a subsidiary or subsidiaries of Osmin (the "NEW OSMIN ENTITIES"), which New
Osmin Entities (and the Crystallex Parties so represent and warrant to the
Assignee) will own all of the then existing assets and be subject to only the
then existing liabilities of the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities, and (ii) enter into a
new, revised or amended and restated Osmin Shareholder's Agreement to replace
the existing Osmin Shareholder's Agreement (the "NEW OSMIN SHAREHOLDER'S
AGREEMENT"). Accordingly:

          (i)   Upon such merger and/or consolidation, the New Osmin Entities
shall be substituted for the Osmin/Tamanaco Entities for all purposes of this
Assignment.

          (ii)   The Crystallex Parties represent and warrant to the Assignor
that such merger and/or consolidation will not adversely affect the payment of
the Bema Debt, and of the Assigned Interests of the payment of any amounts due
or to become due under the Amended Credit Agreement.

          (iii)  Upon the effectiveness of a New Osmin Shareholder's Agreement,
such New Osmin Shareholder's Agreement shall be substituted for the Osmin
Shareholder's Agreement for all purposes of this Assignment.

          (iv)   The Crystallex Parties represent and warrant to the Assignor
that any New Osmin Shareholder's Agreement will not adversely affect the payment
of the Bema Debt, any of the Assigned Interests or the payment of any amounts
due or to become due under the Amended Credit Agreement, except as may have
heretofore been disclosed in writing by the Assignor to the Assignee.

          (v)   The Crystallex Parties covenant and agree with the Assignee that
the New Osmin Shareholder's Agreement will not be amended, revised or terminated
without the prior written consent of the Assignee.
