                  DISTRIBUTOR  a  delay-in-shipment  fee of  1.5%  of the  order
                  price, or the order price of such part or parts of an order on
                  which  delayed  shipment has been sought by  DISTRIBUTOR,  per
                  month starting on the Confirmed  Delivery Date. If DISTRIBUTOR

                  six  calendar   months  from  the  Confirmed   Delivery  Date,
                  iSecureTrac  may treat such requested  delay-in-shipment  as a
                  cancellation, subject to the penalty provisions of Section 4.7
                  above.

                  harmless  against any expense or loss  resulting  from any and
                  all claims that the Products or any part thereof infringe upon
                  any United States or Canadian patent, copyright,  trademark or
                  other proprietary right. iSecureTrac agrees to defend any suit

                  (a)      DISTRIBUTOR  must  promptly  notify   iSecureTrac  in
                           writing  of any  claim of  infringement  and  provide
                           iSecureTrac,  at its  request  and  at  iSecureTrac's
                           expense,   with  the   assistance,   information  and
                           cooperation  necessary  to  defend  against  any such

                  (b)      DISTRIBUTOR  must  not make  any  admissions  without
                           iSecureTrac's consent and must grant iSecureTrac sole
                           authority to defend or settle such claim;

                  (c)      Any costs incurred or recovered in such litigation or
                           negotiation  shall accrue to  iSecureTrac's  account;
                           and

                  (d)      If a  preliminary  injunction  or final  judgment  is
                           entered against DISTRIBUTOR's use or operation of any
                           Product because of any alleged infringement, or if in
                           iSecureTrac's  opinion such an injunction or judgment
                           is likely,  then iSecureTrac,  at its own expense and
                           option  shall (i)  modify or replace  the  Product so
                           that  it  becomes   non-infringing   while  providing
                           equivalent   performance;   or   (ii)   procure   for
                           DISTRIBUTOR  the right to  continue to use and resell
                           Products;  or (iii) in the event iSecureTrac has been
                           unable to achieve such  procurement or  modifications
                           despite its best  efforts,  to refund to  DISTRIBUTOR
                           the  price  DISTRIBUTOR  paid  for  such  Product  or
                           Products   less  such  amount   determined  to  be  a
                           depreciation   to  fair  market   value  by  standard
                           accounting practices.
