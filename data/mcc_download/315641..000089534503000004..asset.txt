     (the inventory set forth thereon, the "Inventory" or "Inventories"),
     fixed assets (the fixed assets set forth thereon, the "Fixed Assets"),
     and real property rights and interests, which rights and interests are

     affixed to said premises, including, without limitation, all of the
     electrical, heating, plumbing, air conditioning, air compression and
     all other systems located on said premises, and all other structures,
     fences and improvements (all such real property rights and interests,
     the "Fee Property"), set forth thereon, provided, however that
     inventory or accounts receivable not in excess of $20,000 in the
     aggregate set forth thereon sold at fair market value or paid in full,
     respectively, in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
     past practice prior to the Closing Date shall not be included in the
     Acquired Assets.

          (b) Business Records. All books and records relating to the
     Acquired Assets (as hereinafter defined), including, without
     limitation, all files, invoices, forms, accounts, correspondence,
     production records, technical, accounting, manufacturing and
     procedural manuals, employment records, studies, reports or summaries
     relating to any Environmental Laws (as hereinafter defined), and other
     books and records relating to the Acquired Assets, and any
     confidential information which has been reduced to writing or other
     tangible medium relating to or arising out of the Business and
     relating to the Acquired Assets but not including books and records
     relating to taxes (collectively, the "Business Records");

          (c) Rights Under Warranties. All rights, claims and benefits of
     any Seller in, to or under any express or implied warranties from the
     suppliers of goods or services included in the Acquired Assets
     (including any coverage rights under product liability or other
     insurance maintained by any of such suppliers for the benefit of any
     Seller);

          (d) Permits. All licenses, permits, approvals, variances, waivers
     or consents (collectively, the "Permits"), to the extent transferable,
     issued by any foreign, United States, state or local governmental
     entity or municipality or subdivision thereof or any authority,
     department, commission, board, bureau, agency, court or
     instrumentality (each a "Governmental Authority" and collectively
     "Governmental Authorities") and used in or necessary to the operation
     of the Acquired Assets; and

          (e) Insurance. All rights, claims and benefits of any Seller in,
     to or under all insurance policies maintained by such Seller for or
     related to the Acquired Assets with respect to such Acquired Assets.

All of the assets, properties, rights and interests owned, used, occupied
or held by or for the benefit of Sellers in the operation of the Business
that are to be sold, transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered by
Sellers to Buyer at the Closing as contemplated herein are referred to
herein collectively as the "Acquired Assets".

     Section 1.2  Retained Assets. Buyer shall in no way be construed to
have purchased or acquired (or to be obligated to purchase or to acquire)
any interest whatsoever in any assets not described in Section 1.1.

     Section 1.3  Assignability and Consents.

          (a) Required Consents. Schedule 1.3 sets forth a list of all
     Acquired Assets, including Permits, which are nonassignable or
     nontransferable or cannot be subleased to Buyer without the consent of
     some other individual, partnership, corporation, association, joint
     stock company, trust, joint venture, limited liability company, entity
     or Governmental Authority (each, a "Person"). Sellers have commenced
     and shall continue to take, or cause to be taken by others, all
     necessary actions reasonably required to obtain or satisfy, at the
     earliest practicable date, all consents, novations, approvals,
     authorizations, requirements (including filing and registration
     requirements), waivers and agreements ("Consents") from any Persons
     necessary to authorize, approve or permit the full and complete sale,
     conveyance, assignment, sublease or transfer of the Acquired Assets,
     and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement and to continue such efforts as may be required after
     the Closing Date to facilitate the full and expeditious transfer of
     legal title, or the sublease, as the case may be, of the Acquired
     Assets.

          (b) Nonassignable Items. Anything in this Agreement to the
     contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an
     agreement to sell, convey, assign, sublease or transfer any Acquired
     Assets, including Permits, if an attempted sale, conveyance,
     assignment, sublease or transfer thereof, without the Consent of
     another party thereto or a Governmental Authority would constitute a
     breach of, or in any way affect the rights of any Seller or Buyer with
     respect to such Acquired Asset ("Nonassignable Items"). Each Seller
     shall use its reasonable best efforts and Buyer shall cooperate in all
     reasonable respects with Sellers to obtain and satisfy all Consents
     and to resolve all impracticalities of sale, conveyance, assignment,
     sublease or transfer necessary to convey to Buyer all Nonassignable
     Items. If any such Consents are not obtained and satisfied or if an
     attempted sale, conveyance, assignment, sublease or transfer would be
     ineffective, Sellers and their appropriate Affiliates shall at the
     Closing enter into such arrangements (including related written
     agreements) as Buyer may reasonably request to fairly compensate Buyer
     for the loss of, or to provide to Buyer the benefit of, any such
     Nonassignable Items (it being acknowledged that such arrangement may
     include obligations imposed on Sellers and such Affiliates promptly to
     pay to Buyer when received all monies and other items of value
     received by Sellers and such Affiliates under any such Nonassignable
     Item).

                                 ARTICLE II

                       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Section 5.1 Representations and Warranties of Sellers. Subject only to
those exceptions and qualifications listed and described on the Schedules
attached to this Agreement, Sellers, jointly and severally, hereby
represent and warrant to Buyer that:

          (a) Organization and Standing; Power and Authority. Each Seller
     is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and (except with
     respect to Rohn Construction) in good standing under the laws of the
     state of its incorporation as set forth in the preamble to this
     Agreement. Each Seller has full corporate power and authority to
     operate the Business, to own or lease the Acquired Assets, to carry on
     the Business as now being conducted, and to enter into and perform
     this Agreement and the transactions and other agreements and
     instruments contemplated by this Agreement. Each Seller is duly
     qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is
     in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or lease
     of the Acquired Assets or the operation of the Business requires such
     qualification. This Agreement and all other agreements and instruments
     executed and delivered or to be executed and delivered by any Seller
     in connection herewith (collectively, the "Transaction Documents")
     have been, or upon execution thereof will be, duly executed and
     delivered by such Seller, as the case may be. This Agreement and the
     transactions and other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby
     have been duly approved by the Board of Directors and controlling
     shareholder of each Seller, and constitute the valid and binding
     obligations of each Seller, enforceable in accordance with their
     respective terms.

          (b) Articles and Bylaws. The copies of the Certificate or
     Articles of Incorporation of each Seller, certified by the Secretary
     of State of such Seller's state of incorporation, and the Bylaws of
     each Seller, provided to Buyer are true, correct and complete.

          (c) Conflicts; Defaults. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(c),
     neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
     agreements and instruments executed or to be executed in connection
     herewith by any Seller, nor the performance by any Seller of the
     transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will (i) violate,
     conflict with, or constitute a default under, any of the terms of any
     Seller's Certificate or Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or violate
     or conflict with in any material respect or constitute a material
     default under any provisions of, or result in the acceleration of any
     obligation under, any contract, sales commitment, license, purchase
     order, security agreement, mortgage, note, deed, lien, lease,
     agreement or instrument, or any order, judgment or decree, relating to
     the Business or the Acquired Assets, or by which any Seller or the
     Acquired Assets are bound, (ii) result in the creation or imposition
     of any Liens in favor of any third Person upon any of the Acquired
     Assets, (iii) violate any Law, (iv) constitute an event that, after
     notice or lapse or time or both, would result in a material violation,
     conflict, default, acceleration, or creation or imposition of a Lien,
     or (v) constitute an event that, after notice of lapse of time or
     otherwise would create, or cause to be exercisable or enforceable, any
     option, agreement or right of any kind to purchase any of the Acquired
     Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(c), no consent, novation,
     approval, filing or authorization will be required to be obtained or
     satisfied for the continued performance by Buyer following the Closing
     of any contract, agreement, commitment or undertaking included in the
     Acquired Assets. No Seller is in violation of or in default under its
     Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. Except as set
     forth on Schedule 5.1(c), no Seller is in violation in any material
     respect of or in material breach of any provision of any contract,
     sales commitment, license, purchase order, security agreement,
     mortgage, note, deed, lien, lease, agreement or instrument, or any
     order, judgment or decree, relating to the Business or the Acquired
     Assets, or by which any Seller or the Acquired Assets is bound, or in
     the payment of any of Seller's monetary obligations or debts relating
     to the Business, and there exists no condition or event which, after
     notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any such violation or
     default.

          (d) Acquired Assets; Title to the Acquired Assets. All of the
     Acquired Assets are in good operating condition and repair, subject to
     normal wear and tear consistent with the age of the properties or
     assets, and are adequate and sufficient for the uses to which they are
     put in the Business. None of the Acquired Assets has any material
     defects or are in need of maintenance or repair, except for ordinary,
     routine maintenance and repairs which are not material in nature or
     cost. Sellers have good and valid title to, and the valid and
     enforceable power and unqualified right to use and transfer to Buyer,
     each of the Acquired Assets, including, without limitation, all dies,
     molds or other tooling or equipment included in the Acquired Assets,
     wherever located, and the Acquired Assets are free and clear of all
     Liens of any kind or nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens.
     The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     (including, without limitation, the transfer or assignment of the
     Acquired Assets, and all rights and interests therein, to Buyer as
     contemplated herein) will not adversely affect such title or rights,
     or any terms of the applicable agreements (whether written or oral)
     evidencing, creating or granting such title or rights. None of the
     Acquired Assets are subject to, or held under, any lease (other than
     the Existing Lease (as hereinafter defined)), mortgage, security
     agreement, conditional sales contract or other title retention
     agreement (in each case, other than in favor of members of Buyer), or
     are other than in the sole possession and under the sole control of
     Sellers. The delivery to Buyer of the instruments of transfer of
     ownership contemplated by this Agreement will vest good and valid
     (and, in the case of the Fee Property, marketable) title to the
     Acquired Assets in Buyer, free and clear of all Liens of any kind or
     nature whatsoever, except for (i) Liens arising by operation of law
     that are, individually or in the aggregate, of immaterial amount
     (other than Taxes not included in clause (ii) hereof), other than
     under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
     ("ERISA") or section 412 of the Code, (ii) Liens for current taxes,
     assessments, or governmental charges or levies on property not due and
     payable as of the Closing Date, (iii) Liens in favor of the
     administrative agent and the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, (iv)
     with respect to real property, the Existing Leases (as defined below),
     any zoning, building codes, and other land use laws regulating the use
     or having jurisdiction over real property that do not, individually or
     in the aggregate, have a material impact on the use or value of such
     property, (v) with respect to real property, any easements, covenants,
     conditions, restrictions, or similar matters of record affecting title
     to such property that would not or do not impair the use or occupancy
     of such property in its current use and operation and (vi) Liens set
     forth on Schedule 5.1(d) (the Liens described in clauses (i) through
     (vi) being collectively referred to herein as "Permitted Liens").

          (e) Real Property. Neither the whole nor any portion of any Fee
     Property has been condemned, requisitioned or otherwise taken by any
     Governmental Authority, and, to the best of Sellers' knowledge, no
     such condemnation, requisition or taking is threatened or
     contemplated. All buildings, structures, fixtures and appurtenances
     comprising part of the Fee Property are in good condition and have
     been well maintained, normal wear and tear excepted. Sellers have
     delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of any leases or occupancy
     agreements currently encumbering the Fee Property (the "Existing
     Leases").

          (f) Accounts Receivable; Collection; Trade Payables. All Accounts
     Receivable outstanding as of the Closing Date represent sales actually
     made in the ordinary and normal course of business. To the Sellers'
     knowledge, there are no counterclaims or setoffs against (or any basis
     therefor), or any other matter or condition likely to interfere with
     full and timely collection of, any of such outstanding Accounts
     Receivable. Schedule 1.1 sets forth an aged listing by customer of the
     Accounts Receivable that are outstanding as of December 19, 2002.

          (g) Inventories. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(g), all of
     the Inventories are of a quality and quantities usable or salable in
     the ordinary and normal course of business, and there are no damaged
     or obsolete items or items of below standard quality included therein.
     The value for the Inventory stated on Schedule 1.1 reflects the value
     on a first-in, first-out basis and reflects writeoffs or writedowns
     for damaged or obsolete items, or items of below standard quality, in
     accordance with the historical inventory policy and practices of
     Sellers.

          (h) Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(h), no Seller
     is subject to any order of, or written agreement or memorandum or
     understanding with, any Governmental Authority relating to the
     Business, and there exists no material litigation, action, suit, claim
     or proceeding pending, or, to the best of Sellers' knowledge, any
     litigation, action, suit, investigation, claim or proceeding
     threatened against or affecting any Seller, the Business or the
     Acquired Assets, or any employee associated with the Business or the
     Acquired Assets, or which would affect the transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement, at law or in equity or before any Governmental
     Authority, including, without limitation, claims for product warranty,
     product liability, antitrust, unfair competition, price discrimination
     or other liability or obligation relating to products of the Business,
     whether manufactured or sold by any Seller, any of their Affiliates or
     any of their respective predecessors-in-interest in respect of the
     Business, or which would adversely affect the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no one
     has grounds to assert any such litigation, action, suit, claim or
     proceeding. Set forth on Schedule 5.1(h) is a description of (i) all
     litigation, actions, suits, investigations, claims and proceedings
     asserted, brought or, to Sellers' knowledge, threatened against any
     Seller or its Affiliates or predecessors-in-interest in respect of the
     Business during the one-year period preceding the date hereof that is
     (x) material and (y) solely with respect to litigation actually filed,
     not dismissed, settled or otherwise fully and finally resolved,
     together with a description of the outcome or present status thereof,
     and (ii) all judgments, orders, decrees, writs or injunctions entered
     into by or against any Seller with respect to the Business within the
     past three years. None of the matters set forth on Schedule 5.1(h)
     relate to Acquired Assets.

          (i) Regulatory Compliance. Except as set forth on Schedule
     5.1(i), the Business has been conducted, the Acquired Assets have been
     maintained and each Seller is currently in material compliance with
     all applicable Laws (including, without limitation, all laws relating
     to zoning, building codes, civil rights, occupational health and
     safety, antitrust, consumer protection, currency exchange, equal
     opportunity, pensions, securities and trading-with-the-enemy), and no
     material expenditures are or will be required to comply with any such
     laws, regulations and orders of Governmental Authorities. No Seller
     is, with respect to the Business, in material default under, and no
     event has occurred which, with the lapse of time or action by a third
     party, could result in material default under, the terms of any
     judgment, decree, order, writ or injunction of any Governmental
     Authority, whether at law or in equity.

          (j) Brokers, Finders and Agents. No Seller is directly or
     indirectly obligated to anyone acting as a broker, finder or in any
     other similar capacity in connection with this Agreement or the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (k) Permits. Schedule 5.1(k) contains a true, correct and
     complete list of all Permits issued to any Seller that are currently
     used by such Seller in connection with the Acquired Assets (except for
     the operations relating to Sellers' or their Affiliates' equipment
     enclosures business). Each Seller has, and is in full compliance in
     all material respects with, all Permits that are necessary or required
     for the operation of the Acquired Assets, all of which Permits are in
     full force and effect. There has been no change in the facts or
     circumstances reported or assumed in the application for or granting
     of such Permits which could have a negative impact on the continuing
     availability, effectiveness or enforceability of any such Permit. No
     Seller's operation of the Business during the pendency of its
     applications, if any, for Permits violates any law, regulation or

          all federal, state or local statutes, laws, rules, regulations,
          ordinances or common law, including any judicial or
          administrative orders, consent decrees or judgments, relating to

               (A)  Each Seller (with respect to the Acquired Assets) and
                    all purchased real property is in material compliance
                    with all, and each Seller (with respect to the Acquired
                    Assets) has no material liability under any, applicable
                    Environmental Laws.

               (B)  There are no present or past material Environmental
                    Conditions relating to any Seller (with respect to the
                    Acquired Assets), any purchased real property or, to
                    Sellers' knowledge, any real property formerly owned or
                    operated by the Sellers (with respect to the Acquired
                    Assets);

               (C)  No Seller (with respect to the Acquired Assets) is a
                    potentially responsible party with respect to any
                    foreign, federal, state, or local environmental
                    clean-up site or with respect to investigations,
                    remediation or corrective actions under any
                    Environmental Law, except for sites, investigations,
                    remediation or corrective actions that would not

                    potential claim, demand, action, investigation or
                    administrative or judicial proceeding in connection
                    with the Acquired Assets regarding (A) any Release or
                    threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials at any
                    Site or other location, (B) any violation of or
                    non-compliance by any Seller with the conditions of any
                    Permit required under any Environmental Law or the
                    provisions of any Environmental Law with respect to the
                    Acquired Assets or any Site, or (C) any actual or
                    threatened injury or damage to any Person, property,

                    relating to any Release, threatened Release,
                    generation, transportation, disposal or presence of any
                    Hazardous Materials with respect to the Business; in
                    the case of each of (A), (B) or (C) that would not
                    reasonably be expected to be material

               (E)  Each Seller has obtained all material permits, licenses
                    and approvals required by applicable Environmental Laws

          than those with respect to on-site conditions at Sellers'
          facility in Peoria, Illinois) are reasonably likely to,
          individually or in the aggregate, constitute a material adverse
          change in the Business.

               (v) Definitions.

               (A)  For purposes of this Agreement:

                    (1)  "Environmental Conditions" shall mean the Release
                         or threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials
                         (whether or not such Release or threatened Release
                         constituted at the time thereof a violation of any
                         Environmental Law) as a result of which (i)
                         Hazardous Materials are present in the environment
                         in concentrations in excess of applicable cleanup
                         standards, remediation criteria, corrective action
                         objectives or similar, analogous standards, (ii)

                         Acquired Assets is reasonably likely to be
                         subjected to any Lien or liability;

                    (2)  "Hazardous Materials" shall mean (i) any petroleum

                         insulation, transformers or other equipment that
                         contains dielectric fluid containing levels of
                         polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and radon gas;
                         and (ii) any chemicals, materials or substances
                         which are defined as or included in the definition
                         of "hazardous substances", "hazardous wastes",
                         "hazardous materials", "extremely hazardous

                         substances", "toxic pollutants", "contaminants" or
                         "pollutants", or words of similar import, under
                         any applicable Environmental Law; and (iii) any
                         other chemical or other substance, exposure to
                         which is prohibited, limited or regulated under
                         any Environmental Law;

                    (3)  "Release" shall mean any release, spill, leak,
                         pumping, pouring, emission, emptying, discharge,
                         injection, escape, leaching, dumping or disposal
                         into the environment; and

                    (4)  "Site" shall mean any real property now or
                         previously owned or operated by any Seller with
                         respect to the Business.

          (m) Taxes. Each Seller has filed or caused to be filed all
     material Tax returns and reports relating to the Business and the
     Acquired Assets required to be filed. All Taxes owed to any
     Governmental Authority by any Seller for periods covered by such
     returns and reports, and all claims, demands, assessments, judgments,
     costs and expenses connected therewith, have been paid in full or are
     being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
     respect to which adequate reserves in accordance with United States
     generally accepted accounting principles have been established in the
     books and records of the Sellers for the payment of such Taxes. No
     Seller is a party to any action or proceeding, nor to the best of
     Sellers' knowledge, is any such action or proceeding contemplated or
     threatened, for the assessment or collection of any Taxes relating to
     the Business or the Acquired Assets, and no deficiency notices or
     reports have been received by any Seller in respect of any Tax
     relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets. The federal income
     tax returns of each Seller have been examined by the Internal Revenue
     Service for all periods to and including those set forth in Schedule
     5.1(m), and, except to the extent shown therein, all deficiencies
     asserted as a result of such examinations have been paid or finally
     settled and no issue has been raised by the Internal Revenue Service
     in any such examination which, by application of the same or similar
     principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed
     deficiency for any other period not so examined. No state of facts
     exists or has existed which would constitute grounds for the
     assessment of any material federal income Tax liability with respect
     to the periods which have not been audited by the Internal Revenue
     Service. Except to the extent set forth on Schedule 5.1(m), there are
     no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory period of
     limitation applicable to any federal income tax return for any period.
     Copies of all income tax returns with respect to the Business for each
     Seller in respect of all years not barred by the statute of
     limitations have heretofore been delivered to Buyer. For the purposes
     of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" means all net income, gross
     income, gross receipts, sales, use, ad valorem, transfer, franchise,
     profits, license, withholding, payroll, employment, excise, severance,
     stamp, occupation, premium, property or windfall profits taxes,
     customs duties or other taxes, fees, assessments or charges of any
     kind whatsoever, together with any interest and any penalties,
     additions to tax or additional amounts imposed by any taxing authority
     (domestic or foreign). General and special real estate taxes,
     utilities charges and installments of assessments not due and payable
     on the Fee Property as of the Closing (the "Proratable Items") shall
     be prorated and adjusted ratably between Parent and Buyer as of
     Closing. If the amount of any Proratable Item is not ascertainable at
     Closing Date, the adjustment thereof shall be on the basis of 110% of
     the most recently ascertainable bill therefor, to be reprorated by the
     parties upon receipt of a final bill for such Proratable Item.

          (n) Insurance. Schedule 5.1(n) contains a list of all insurance
     policies (specifying the location, insured, insurer, amount of
     coverage, type of insurance and policy number) maintained by any
     Seller applicable to the Acquired Assets. All such policies are in
     full force and effect, all premiums with respect thereto covering all
     periods up to and including the date of Closing have been paid, and no
     notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect
     to any such policy. Such policies (i) are sufficient for compliance
     with all requirements of law and of all agreements to which any Seller
     is a party, (ii) are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies, and
     (iii) provide adequate insurance coverage for the Acquired Assets. The
     insurance policies being issued or transferred to Buyer, or with
     respect to which Buyer is being named as an additional insured, in
     connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
     valid, outstanding and enforceable policies, and provide adequate
     insurance coverage for the Acquired Assets.

          (o) Approvals. Schedule 1.3 sets forth a list of all Consents
     that must be obtained or satisfied by Seller for the consummation of
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
     limitation, all Consents that must be obtained pursuant to Section
     1.3(a). Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(o), all Consents
     prescribed by any Law (including the Government Contract Regulations,
     the Federal Assignment of Claims Act and the Federal Anti-Assignment
     Act), or any contract, agreement, commitment or undertaking, and which
     must be obtained or satisfied by any Seller for the consummation of
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or for the continued
     performance by them of their rights and obligations hereunder, have
     been, or shall by the Closing have been, made, obtained and satisfied.

          (p) Books and Records. The books and records of each Seller
     accurately record all transactions relating to the Business in all
     material respects, and have been maintained consistent with good
     business practice.

          (q) Warranty Costs. Schedule 5.1(q) is a description of all
     litigation, actions, suits, investigations, claims and proceedings
     asserted, brought or, to Sellers' knowledge, threatened against any
     Seller with respect to the Acquired Assets within the last three years
     preceding the date of this Agreement, together with a description of
     the outcome or present status thereof, in each case relating to any
     claim for warranty costs involving amounts in excess of $10,000,
     individually or in the aggregate. Except as set forth on Schedule
     5.1(q), claims for warranty costs (individually or in the aggregate)
     during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2002 did not exceed
     $50,000, and there are no outstanding or, to Sellers' knowledge,
     threatened claims for any such costs which would exceed $50,000
     (individually or in the aggregate). As used herein, "warranty costs"
     means the costs and expenses of servicing, repairing, returning and/or
     replacing, or allowances for service, repair, return or replacement,
     of defective or allegedly defective or improperly selected or shipped
     products or parts or components thereof manufactured or sold by any
     Seller and the costs of materials and expenses of replacing materials
     or correcting any jobs or materials inadequately performed or
     manufactured by any Seller, together with such legal liability, if
     any, as may exist in connection with sales of such products, whether
     such costs and expenses relate to or arise out of claims or causes of
     action which assert causes sounding in tort, contract or warranty, or
     any combination of the foregoing.

          (r) Copies of Documents. Sellers have delivered to Buyer true,
     correct and complete copies of all contracts, agreements and other
     documents listed in the Schedules to, or referenced in, this
     Agreement, and all modifications and amendments thereto.

          (s) Appraisal. Sellers have delivered to Buyer a true and
     complete copy of the most recent appraisal of the Fee Property located
     in Alabama.

          (t) Disclosure. No representation or warranty made by any Seller
     contained in this Agreement or in any other writing furnished pursuant
     hereto contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state a material fact necessary to make the statements and facts
     contained herein or therein, in light of the circumstances in which
     they were or are made, not false or misleading.

          (u) Employee Benefit Plans. Set forth on Schedule 5.1(u) is a
     list of all "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of
     ERISA, all other severance pay, salary continuation, bonus, incentive,
     stock option, retirement, pension, profit sharing or deferred
     compensation plans, contracts, programs, funds, or arrangements of any
     kind, and all other employee benefit plans, contracts, programs,
     funds, or arrangements (whether written or oral, qualified or
     nonqualified, funded or unfunded, foreign or domestic) and any trust,
     escrow, or similar agreement related thereto, whether or not funded,
     in respect of any present or former employees, directors, officers,
     consultants, or independent contractors of the Sellers or with respect
     to which the Sellers have made or are required to make payments,
     transfers, or contributions and in respect of which Sellers have or
     may have liability (each a "Plan" and, collectively, the "Plans").
     Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.1(u):

               (i) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with
          the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and other legal
          requirements. Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section
          401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
          from the Internal Revenue Service or an application for such a
          letter is currently being processed by the Internal Revenue
          Service with respect thereto and, to the best knowledge of the
          Sellers, nothing has occurred that would prevent, or cause the
          loss of, such qualification. The Sellers and each ERISA Affiliate
          have made all required contributions to each Plan subject to
          Section 412 of the Code, and no application for a funding waiver
          or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to Section
          412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan. For
          purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any
          trade or business (whether or not incorporated) under common
          control with the Sellers within the meaning of Section 414(b) or
          (c) of the Code (and Sections 414(m) and (o) of the Code for
          purposes of provisions relating to Section 412 of the Code).

               (ii) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the
          Sellers, threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any
          governmental authority, with respect to any Plan (other than
          routine claims for benefits). There has been no prohibited
          transaction or violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules of
          ERISA with respect to any Plan that could result in liability in
          excess of $10,000.

               (iii) (a) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
          expected to occur; (b) no Pension Plan has an "accumulated
          funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 412 of the Code),
          whether or not waived, and no application for a waiver of the
          minimum funding standard has been filed with respect to any
          Pension Plan; (c) neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate has
          incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any liability under
          Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan (other than
          premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA); (d)
          neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or
          reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has
          occurred which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of
          ERISA, would result in such liability) under Sections 4201 or
          4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan; and (e)
          neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
          transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of
          ERISA. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "ERISA Event" shall
          mean (I) a Reportable Event with respect to a Pension Plan; (II)
          a withdrawal by the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate from a Pension
          Plan subject to Section 4063 of ERISA during a plan year in which
          it was a substantial employer (as defined in Section 4001(a)(2)
          of ERISA) or a cessation of operations that is treated as such a
          withdrawal under Section 4062(e) of ERISA; (III) a complete or
          partial withdrawal by the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate from a
          Multiemployer Plan or notification that a Multiemployer Plan is
          in reorganization; (IV) the filing of a notice of intent to
          terminate, the treatment of a Plan amendment as a termination
          under Sections 4041 or 4041A of ERISA, or the commencement of
          proceedings by the PBGC to terminate a Pension Plan or
          Multiemployer Plan; (V) an event or condition which constitutes
          grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or
          the appointment of a trustee to administer, any Pension Plan or
          Multiemployer Plan; or (VI) the imposition of any liability under
          Title IV of ERISA, other than for PBGC premiums due but not
          delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA, upon the Sellers or any
          ERISA Affiliate; (B) "Multiemployer Plan" shall mean any employee
          benefit plan of the type described in Section 4001(a)(3) of
          ERISA, to which the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate makes or is
          obligated to make contributions, or during the preceding five
          plan years, has made or been obligated to make contributions; (C)
          "PBGC" shall mean the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; (D)
          "Pension Plan" shall mean any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
          such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), other than a
          Multiemployer Plan, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and is
          sponsored or maintained by the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate or
          to which the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate contributes or has an
          obligation to contribute, or in the case of a multiple employer
          or other plan described in Section 4064(a) of ERISA, has made
          contributions at any time during the immediately preceding five
          plan years; and (E) "Reportable Event" shall mean any of the
          events set forth in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, other than events
          for which the 30 day notice period has been waived.

               (iv) The execution and performance of this Agreement will
          not (a) constitute a stated triggering event under any Plan that
          will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
          otherwise) becoming due from the Sellers or any subsidiary of the
          Sellers to any officer, employee, or former employee (or
          dependents of such employee), or (b) accelerate the time of
          payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to
          any employee, officer or director of the Sellers or any
          subsidiary of the Seller, in any case in excess of $10,000.

               (v) No Additional Representations. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
          TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 5.1 OR ANY OTHER
          PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, IT IS THE EXPLICIT INTENT OF EACH
          PARTY HERETO THAT THE SELLERS ARE MAKING NO REPRESENTATION OR
          WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BEYOND THOSE EXPRESSLY
          GIVEN IN THIS SECTION 5.1, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
          IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO THE CONDITION,
          MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS
          OF ANY SELLER. ANY COST ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER
          PREDICTIONS CONTAINED OR REFERRED TO IN THE SCHEDULES HERETO OR
          OTHERWISE PROVIDED ARE NOT, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE,
          REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY SELLER.

and warrants to Seller that:


          (a) Organization and Standing; Corporate Power and Authority.
     Buyer is a limited liability corporation duly organized, validly

     delivered by Buyer in connection herewith have been duly executed and
     delivered by Buyer. This Agreement and the transactions and other
     agreements and instruments contemplated by this Agreement have been
     duly approved by the members of Buyer, and constitute the valid and
     binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable in accordance with their
     respective terms.

          (b) Conflicts; Defaults. Neither the execution and delivery of
     this Agreement by Buyer, nor the performance of its obligations
     hereunder, will conflict with or constitute a default under any of the
     terms of Buyer's Certificate of Formation or Limited Liability Company
     Agreement or any agreement by which Buyer is bound.

          (c) Brokers, Finders and Agents. Buyer is not directly or
     indirectly obligated to anyone as a broker, finder or in any other

     Loans that constitute the Purchase Price.

          (e) Interests of Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any Lender is a
     stockholder or holder of any option to purchase any equity securities
     of any Seller.

          (f) Ownership of Buyer. The Lenders own all of the equity
     securities of, and all options to purchase equity securities or
     securities convertible into equity securities of, Buyer. Each Lender
     holds a percentage of the total outstanding equity securities of Buyer
     equal to the percentage of the outstanding principal amount
     indebtedness of the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement held by
     such Lender as of the date hereof. No party other than the Lenders or
     the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement has the right to
     Control (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934, as amended) Buyer. No Lender is an individual or natural person
     or a disregarded entity holding for such an individual or natural
     person.

          (g) Disclosure. No representation or warranty made by Buyer
     contained in this Agreement or in any other writing furnished pursuant
     hereto contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state a material fact necessary to make the statements and facts
     contained herein or therein, in light of the circumstances in which
     they were or are made, not false or misleading.

     Section 5.3  General. The representations and warranties of the parties
hereto made in this Agreement, subject to the exceptions thereto, shall not
be affected by any information furnished to, or any investigation conducted
by, any of them or their representatives in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement. The representations and warranties made in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing.

any cash, checks or other documents received by Seller on account of any
such Accounts Receivable. Such Seller or such Affiliate shall advise Buyer
(promptly upon becoming aware thereof) of any counterclaims or setoffs that
may arise subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any Account
Receivable.

     Section 6.3  Plant Closing Obligations. If any Seller or any of its
Affiliates takes any action which could be construed as a "plant closing"
or "mass layoff," or which results in any employee retained or employed in
connection with the Business suffering or deeming to have suffered any
"employment loss," as those terms are defined in WARN, Sellers and such
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for providing any notice required by
WARN and for making payments, if any, which may be required under WARN for
failure to provide appropriate notice.

     Section 6.4  Further Assurances. Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to implement the provisions of this Agreement, and for such
purpose Sellers, at the request of Buyer, at or after the Closing, shall,
without further consideration, promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to Buyer such deeds, assignments, bills of sale,
Consents and other instruments in addition to those required by this
Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, and take all such
other actions, as Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
implement any provision of this Agreement or to more effectively transfer,
convey and assign to Buyer good and valid (and in the case of real
property, marketable) title to, and to put Buyer in actual possession and
operating control of, all of the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. In furtherance of the foregoing
obligation, Sellers shall, promptly upon the request of Buyer (and in any
event within 15 days of any such request) provide any additional
description or detail, or supporting documentation (including, without
limitation, invoices and bills of sale), requested by Buyer with respect to
the Acquired Assets and Schedule 1.1.

contemplated hereby or otherwise disclose this Agreement or the

other party hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit any party from issuing or
causing publication of any press release, announcement or public
communication to the extent that such party deems such action to be
required by Law or stock exchange regulation; provided further that such
party shall, whenever practicable consult with the other party concerning
the timing and content of such press release, announcement or communication
before the same is issued or published.

any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to
events or conditions occurring or existing in connection with, or arising
out of, the operation of the Business prior to the Closing, or the
ownership, possession, use or sale of the Acquired Assets prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall fully cooperate with Buyer in the defense of any
such claim, including by acknowledging that Sellers retained all, and Buyer
assumed no, such liabilities. If a claim is asserted against any Seller or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or Affiliates, with respect to
the ownership, possession, use or sale of the Acquired Assets from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall fully cooperate with Sellers in the defense
of any such claim.

     Section 7.4  Employee Matters. Sellers shall retain all liabilities and
obligations in respect of its past, present and future employees, including
all liabilities under any Plans and applicable Laws. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall have no liability or obligation
whatsoever under the Plans, nor shall Buyer have any obligation to provide
any employee benefits to any Persons employed in the Business at any time.

business for engineering, drafting, sales and administrative purposes
and/or otherwise consolidating their operations at Sellers' or their
Affiliates' facilities in Frankfort, Indiana at a monthly cost to Sellers
to be mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, or, if such cost cannot be
agreed upon by such parties, at a cost to be determined by a reputable
independent appraiser selected by Buyer. Sellers' right to use such
facility shall be subject to the terms set forth on Schedule 7.5.

     Section 7.6  Technical Support. For a period of one year following the
Closing Date, upon the request of Buyer, Sellers shall provide to Buyer
technical support, security, maintenance, repair, mechanical and other
similar services as reasonably requested by Buyer at a fair market value

cost cannot be agreed upon by such parties, at a cost to be determined by a
reputable independent appraiser selected by Buyer. All amounts payable to
Sellers for rendering technical support and services shall be calculated on
a monthly basis and shall be paid to Sellers within thirty days after the
month in which such technical support and services have been provided.

     Section 7.7  Existing Leases. At Closing the Sellers shall sell,

right, title and interest in and to the Existing Leases and Buyer shall
assume and agree to keep, perform and fulfill all of Sellers' duties,

costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees)
incurred by or asserted against Buyer by reason of any default by Sellers
under any Existing Lease occurring prior to the Closing Date. Sellers and
Buyer also hereby agree further from time to time to perform such other
acts, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments,
documents and other materials as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate
the assignment and assumption contemplated hereby.

Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Sellers, their Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, representatives, employees and agents
harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, demands,
assessments, judgments, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, interest, penalties, attorneys' fees to the
extent permitted by law, and accounting fees and investigation costs)
(collectively, "Damages") that may be incurred by any of them resulting or
arising from or related to, or incurred in connection with: (a) the failure
of Buyer to report the purchase of the Acquired Assets in accordance with
the allocations required by Section 3.2, or (b) any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement of Buyer
contained herein or in any other Transaction Document.

     Section 8.2  Indemnification by Sellers.

          (I) General. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall jointly
and severally indemnify, defend and hold Buyer, its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, representatives, employees and agents
harmless from and against any and all Damages that may be incurred by any
of them resulting or arising from, related to or incurred in connection
with: (a) the failure of Sellers to assume, pay, perform and discharge the
Liabilities, (b) the failure of Sellers to report the sale of the Acquired
Assets in accordance with the allocations required by Section 3.2, (c) any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement
of Sellers contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, or (d)
any failure to comply with the laws of any jurisdiction relating to bulk
transfers which may be applicable in connection with the transfer of the
Acquired Assets to Buyer.

          (II) Environmental Indemnification. Sellers jointly and severally
agree to indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold harmless:

               (A)  Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective directors,
                    officers, representatives, lenders, employees and
                    agents; and

               (B)  any other Person who acquires a portion of the Fee
                    Property in any manner, including but not limited to,
                    through purchase, at a foreclosure sale or otherwise
                    through the exercise of the rights and remedies of
                    Buyer under this Agreement; and

               (C)  the contractors, subcontractors, experts, licensees,
                    lessees, mortgagees, trustees, heirs, devisees,
                    successors, assigns and invitees of any Persons
                    referred to in subsections (A) or (B) of this Section
                    8.2(II);

(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and
all Environmental Conditions arising from the presence, use, generation,
storage, treatment, discharge, release or disposal (including off-site
disposal) of Hazardous Materials upon, about, from or beneath the Fee
Property or migrating to or from the Fee Property, or arising in any manner
whatsoever out of the violation of any Environmental Laws pertaining to the
Fee Property and the activities thereon, in each case to the extent that
such Environmental Conditions or violation of any Environmental Laws are
attributable to, or the result of, any act or omission prior to the Closing
Date. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right, at their own cost
and expense, to review in advance and provide comments on any documents
proposed to be submitted to governmental entities or other third parties,
including, without limitation, any proposed or final work plan, report,
compliance schedule, compliance or consent order, decree or agreement.

     Section 8.3  Notice of Claim; Right to Participate in and Defend
Third Party Claim.

          (a) If any indemnified party receives notice of the assertion of
any claim, the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, or the
imposition of any penalty or assessment by a third party in respect of
which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), and the
indemnified party intends to seek indemnity hereunder, then the indemnified
party shall promptly provide the indemnifying party with prompt written
notice of the Third Party Claim, but in any event not later than 30
calendar days after receipt of such notice of Third Party Claim. The
failure by an indemnified party to notify an indemnifying party of a Third
Party Claim shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any indemnification
responsibility under this Article VIII, unless such failure materially
prejudices the ability of the indemnifying party to defend such Third Party
Claim.

          (b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the
defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim with its own
counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) if the
indemnifying party delivers written notice to the indemnified party within
seven days following the indemnifying party's receipt of notice of the
Third Party Claim from the indemnified party acknowledging its obligations
to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim
in accordance with this Article VIII, and, if at any time reasonably
requested by Buyer, establishes security in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party to secure the indemnifying party's
obligations under this Article VIII with respect to such Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that in the case of any Third Party Claim for which the
indemnifying party is obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.2(II), Sellers shall control the defense, compromise
or settlement of the Third Party Claim, and all investigatory, response and
remedial actions with respect thereto; provided, further, that the
indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third Party
Claim which would impose or create any obligation or any financial or other
liability on the part of the indemnified party. In its defense, compromise
or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall timely
provide the indemnified party with such information with respect to such
defense, compromise or settlement as the indemnified party shall reasonably
request, and shall not assume any position or take any action that would
impose an obligation of any kind on, or restrict the actions of, the
indemnified party. The indemnified party shall be entitled (at the
indemnified party's expense) to participate in the defense by the
indemnifying party of any Third Party Claim with its own counsel.

          (c) If the indemnifying party does not undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim in accordance with
subsection (b) of this Section 8.3, or, with respect to any claim under
Section 8.2(II), Sellers fail to take diligent and continuous action as
necessary to address any underlying Environmental Condition in accordance
with Environmental Law, or if any bankruptcy, reorganization or other case
or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or
liquidation proceeding is commenced in respect of the indemnifying party,
the indemnified party shall have the right to control the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing;
provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not settle or
compromise any such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's
prior written consent, unless (i) the terms of such settlement or
compromise release the indemnified party or the indemnifying party from any
and all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, or (ii) the
indemnifying party shall not have acknowledged its obligations to indemnify
the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Article VIII and established security in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to secure the indemnifying
party's obligations under this Article VIII with respect to such Third
Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall be entitled (at the indemnifying
party's expense) to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim
with its own counsel.

          (d) Any indemnifiable claim hereunder that is not a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by the indemnified party by promptly delivering
notice thereof to the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does
not respond to such notice within 60 days after its receipt, it shall have
no further right to contest the validity of such claim.

     Section 8.4  Setoff. In addition to any and all other remedies
hereunder or at law or in equity, Buyer shall be entitled to recover any
indemnification payment or other amounts due from Sellers hereunder by
retaining and setting off the amounts (whether or not such amounts are
liquidated or reduced to judgment) against any amounts due or to become due
from Buyer or any member or other Affiliate of Buyer to any Seller
hereunder or under any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith.

     Section 8.5  Time Limitations on Claims for Indemnification. The right
of Buyer to indemnification for any breach of any representation or
warranty shall apply only to those claims for indemnification which are
given pursuant to this Agreement on or before the respective dates set
forth below:

     representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1(m) shall be

     statute of limitations (and any waivers or extensions thereof)
     applicable to any claim arising in connection with any breach of any
     such representations and warranties;

          (b) No time limit shall apply to any right to indemnification
     with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty contained
     in Sections 5.1(a), (b), (d) or (l); and

          (c) Any claim for indemnification with respect to any breach of
     any representation or warranty set forth in any subsection of Section
     5.1 not referred to in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section 8.5
     shall be made on or before the date which is three years following the
     Closing Date.

     Section 8.6  Maximum and De Minimis Amounts; Recoveries Limited.

          (a) The maximum amount of indemnification that can be required of
     Sellers under Section 8.2(I)(c) for any breach of any representation
     or warranty set forth in Section 5.1 (or any portion thereof) shall
     not exceed $7,398,191.

          (b) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold
     Buyer harmless from and against any Damages or Environmental
     Conditions under Section 8.2(I)(c) with respect to any breach of any
     representation or warranty unless and until the amount of such Damages
     or Environmental Conditions equals $100,000 in the aggregate (the
     "Threshold Amount"), in which event Sellers shall be obligated to
     indemnify Buyer, and Buyer may assert its right to indemnification
     hereunder, to the full extent of all Damages or Environmental
     Conditions relating to such breach, including Damages or Environmental
     Conditions that are less than the Threshold Amount.

     Section 8.7  Exclusions. No limitation set forth in Sections 8.5 or 8.6
shall apply with respect to any matter as to which any Seller had knowledge
as of the Closing and which was not disclosed in writing to Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the schedules hereto.

     Section 8.8  Insurance. If Buyer incurs or discovers any loss or damage
following the Closing relating to pre-Closing events or conditions that is
covered by or subject to policies of insurance maintained by any Seller,
Sellers shall take all commercially reasonable actions requested by Buyer
to enforce such policies of insurance, including seeking recovery for any
such loss or damage claimed by Buyer, provided, however, Buyer shall pay
all deductibles in connection with such claims. Sellers shall promptly pay
or transfer any amounts recovered from such insurance policies to Buyer.

                                ARTICLE IX
                               MISCELLANEOUS

the purpose of any such litigation as set forth above. Sellers and Buyer
further irrevocably consent to the service of process by registered mail,

inconvenient forum. To the extent that Sellers or Buyer have or hereafter
may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal

(to the extent such compliance is for the benefit of the party giving such
waiver) with any of the terms, covenants or conditions contained in this
Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents (except such as may
be imposed by law). Any waiver by any party of any violation of, breach of,
or default under, any provision of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, by any other party shall not be construed as, or
constitute, a continuing waiver of such provision, or waiver of any other
violation of, breach of or default under any other provision of this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents.

     Section 9.11  Schedules. The Schedules attached to this Agreement are
incorporated herein and shall be part of this Agreement for all purposes.

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" shall
mean any Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more Persons,

specified or, directly or indirectly, is related to or otherwise associated
with any such Person or entity.

          (b) For purposes of this Agreement and of any other Transaction
Document, references to any Seller's knowledge, or Sellers' knowledge,
shall be deemed to include all information that is actually known or, in
the exercise of reasonable diligence in the normal course of their
employment and/or assigned duties, should be known, by each of the
following individuals: (i) the following officers of Sellers: John Austin,
David Brinker, Alan Dix, Paul Grove, Jeffrey Jablonski, or Horace Ward and
all management or supervisory personnel who are (or, at any time since

directors of employees of any Seller or any of their Affiliates, and (ii)

Affiliates who have (or should have) exercised by reason of their position,
responsibilities or duties, the principal supervisory, monitoring or
compliance function with respect to any of the particular subject matters
addressed by the representations and warranties set forth in Article V of
this Agreement.

     Section 9.14  Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy conferred by any of the
specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other remedy and each remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition
to every other remedy given hereunder or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or by statute or otherwise. No remedy shall be deemed to be a
limitation on the amount or measure of damages resulting from any breach of
this Agreement. The election of any one or more remedies shall not
constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies.

     Section 9.15  Gender and Number. The masculine, feminine or neuter
gender and the singular or plural number shall each be deemed to include
the others whenever the context so indicates.

     Section 9.16  Third Parties. Nothing expressed or implied in this
