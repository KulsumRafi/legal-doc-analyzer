Agreement or any other Credit Document.

          9.   This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which

each New Lender shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent for the
accounts of the respective Existing Lenders, an amount equal to such New

Loans.

          12.  Notwithstanding Section 11 of this Amendment, if for any reason
any New Lender shall not have (i) signed a counterpart hereof and delivered the
same to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office and (ii) delivered to the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such New Lender's relevant PRO RATA
Share of the principal amount of the outstanding Loans, in each case on or prior

Amendment shall become effective notwithstanding such failure, PROVIDED that (x)
Schedule C shall be modified to delete any such New Lender and such New Lender's
relevant PRO RATA Share shall be reallocated to the respective Existing Lender
and (y) the signature pages of this Amendment shall be deemed revised to delete
such New Lender's name therefrom.

          13.  From and after the First Amendment Effective Date, all references
