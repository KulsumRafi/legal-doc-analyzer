</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><dir>(a) <u>Initial Services</u>. Attached hereto as <u>Schedule
&quot;A</u>&quot; and incorporated herein by this reference, is a description of the

Agreement and by initialing where indicated adjacent to various products and
services described on <u>Schedule &quot;A-1</u>&quot; attached hereto and incorporated
herein by reference, Customer engages ACS to provide such indicated products and
services (herein such products and services which are so indicated by Customer's
and ACS' initials on <u>Schedule &quot;A-1</u>&quot; will be referred to as the
&quot;Services&quot;), and ACS agrees to provide such Services, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Schedules hereto. The prices for
such products and services as of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) of
this Agreement are indicated on <u>Schedule &quot;A-2</u>&quot; attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference. Specifications and any special terms and
conditions which relate to the performance of the Services are provided in <u>
Schedule &quot;A-3</u>&quot; attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) <u>Changed or Additional Services</u>. If Customer wishes
to change the Services or wishes to add to the Services covered by this
Agreement, Customer shall so advise ACS in writing, and shall submit
specifications therefor to ACS. After receipt of the specifications, ACS shall
provide Customer with a cost estimate for performing the changed or additional
services. The parties shall then negotiate in good faith and agree upon a charge
for such changed or additional services and complete amended Schedules, as
applicable, to reflect such changed or additional services. The performance of
and payment for such Services shall otherwise be governed by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) <u>Different Services</u>. If Customer requests services
that are different in kind from the Services governed by this Agreement (e.g.,
programming or software development), then ACS shall promptly consider such
request and, if deemed appropriate by ACS, submit a proposed Agreement covering
such different services. ACS shall not be obligated to perform and shall not
charge Customer for any different services, unless agreed to in writing by the
parties.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) <u>Enhanced/New Services</u>. If, after the Effective
Date, ACS offers enhanced or new services, ACS may announce same and associated

after delivery, or Customer desires to retain such copy (and/or obtain
additional copies of such EDP Audit Report), then Customer will be charged the
fees noted in <u>Schedule &quot;A-2</u>&quot; attached hereto. Customer may, at its own

</font>(the &quot;Conversion Date Deadline&quot;), then ACS shall have the option, which
option shall be exercised by written notice to Customer not later than thirty
(30) days after the Conversion Date Deadline, to either: (i) terminate this
Agreement, in which event Customer shall pay to ACS a termination fee in an
amount equal to the monthly fee which ACS reasonably estimates that Customer

due and payable within ten (10) days after the exercise by ACS of such option to
terminate this Agreement, or (ii) extend the Conversion Date Deadline for a
period of up to six (6) months, in which event Customer shall pay to ACS a fee
in an amount equal to the monthly fee which ACS reasonably estimates that
Customer would have paid under this Agreement, with such payment to be due and
payable on the tenth day of the month next succeeding the month in which such
fees would have otherwise been earned.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) <u>Renewal Terms</u>. This Agreement and the term hereof
shall be automatically renewed for successive periods each equal to the period

Term, at </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 3</p>

option to increase fees at the end of any subsequent eighteen (18) month period.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) <u>Monthly Invoices</u>. ACS will bill Customer for
current Services on a monthly basis. Payment for services by Customer will be

interest to be charged exceed the highest applicable lawful rate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) <u>Taxes</u>. The fees stated in <u>Schedule &quot;A-2</u>&quot; to
this Agreement do not include local, state, or federal sales, use, excise,

basis, the determination of the charge by ACS in addition to such cost to be
determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g) <u>Government Mandated Changes</u>. If, after the
Effective Date hereof, any modifications to the Services shall be required by
law or by any governmental regulatory authority having authority over the
business of Customer, ACS shall, except to the extent such changes may be beyond

compliance with such modified laws or governmental regulations. ACS may, at its
discretion, pass on, in whole or in part, on an equitable basis to all users of
the Services (including Customer) affected by any such modification the actual

account number, check number, amount of check and reason for return for each
check to be returned plus such other information as ACS may reasonably request.
The file format will be as mutually agreed between ACS and Customer.</p>

defined in 4(a) above, will be processed by ACS and ACS will not be held
responsible if the late return is dishonored.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Customer shall have the right between the hours of

responsible for the issuance of Customer Checks and other documents to its
depositors. Customer shall also be responsible for controlling the quality and

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 16</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">rectify. ACS will make reasonable efforts to continue to process checks
but will not be liable for delays, etc., which such sub-standard documents will
cause. Customer's Routing Symbol - A.B.A. number, account numbers and
consecutive check numbers will be MICR encoded on all Customer Checks to be
processed under this Agreement. Excessive processing delays, as a result of
faulty documents, can result in financial penalties equivalent to double the
standard per item fee if the error rate exceeds 1.5% of the daily inclearing
volume.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <u>Signature Verification</u>. Customer will be solely
responsible for the authenticity of drawers' signatures on Customer Checks. ACS
will not be responsible for drawers signatures on Customer Checks or for the
authenticity of any endorsement, regardless of check amount. ACS will provide to
Customer all Customers Checks presented in the Inclearings which are $5,000 and
higher, or such other threshold amount as Customer advise ACS in writing. These
checks will be available for pick up or delivered to Customer at the main office
by g:00 am. the next business day. If Customer wishes, copies can be delivered
in lieu of originals, at the fees set out in Schedule A-2. ACS does offer a
signature verification service which is not part of this agreement.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. <u>Photocopies</u>. ACS will microfilm both sides of all
Customer Checks processed, except over-the-counter checks which will be filmed
at cycle time if Customer chooses option to film cycle work, photocopies are
provided upon request and the fees therefore shall be as set out in Schedule
A-2.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. <u>Stop Payment</u>. Customer is responsible for placing
stop payment of Customer Checks, if any. ACS will not be responsible for stop
payments. For purposes of this Agreement, Customer should treat such items as
Return Items (see paragraph 3).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. <u>Certified Check</u>. Customer is responsible for
insuring and maintaining certified check information and ACS has no
responsibility to maintain such data. Customer is required to either hole punch
the account number field or utilize a certification sticker to be affixed over
the preprinted MIOR account number on the Customer Check being certified. ACS
will return such items daily to Customer after processing.</p>
