2.   Registration Rights.

     2.1.       Demand Registrations.

          (a)      (i)    Subject to Section 2.1(b) below, at any time, the
Holders shall have the right to require the Company to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act covering such aggregate number of Registrable
Securities which represents 20% or greater of the Total Voting Power of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities, by delivering a written request therefor to
the Company specifying the number of Registrable Securities to be included in
such registration by such Holders and the intended method of distribution
thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that no shares of Common Stock issued or issuable,
directly or indirectly, upon conversion of (x) shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock or (y) shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be
included in such request prior to the date that is eighteen months from the date
hereof. All such requests by any Holder pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i) are
referred to herein as "Demand Registration Requests," and the registrations so
requested are referred to herein as "Demand Registrations" (with respect to any
Demand Registration, the Holders making such demand for registration being
referred to as the "Initiating Holders"). As promptly as practicable, but no
later than ten days after receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company
shall give written notice (the "Demand Exercise Notice") of such Demand
Registration Request to all Holders of record of Registrable Securities.

                   (ii)   The Company, subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6, shall
include in a Demand Registration (x) the Registrable Securities of the
Initiating Holders and (y) the Registrable Securities of any other Holder of
Registrable Securities which shall have made a written request to the Company
for inclusion in such registration (together with the Initiating Holders, the
"Participating Holders")(which request shall specify the maximum number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Participating Holders)
within 30 days after the receipt of the Demand Exercise Notice (or, 15 days if,
at the request of the Initiating Holders, the Company states in such written
notice or gives telephonic notice to all Holders, with written confirmation to
follow promptly thereafter, that such registration will be on a Form S-3).

                   (iii)  The Company shall, as expeditiously as possible but
subject to Section 2.1(b), use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) effect
such registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities which
the Company has been so requested to register, for distribution in accordance
with such intended method of distribution, including a distribution to, and
resale by, the partners of a Holder (a "Partner Distribution") and (y) if
requested by the Majority Participating Holders, obtain acceleration of the
effective date of the registration statement relating to such registration.

                   (iv)   Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company shall, at the request of any Holder seeking to effect a
Partner Distribution, file any prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendments and to otherwise take any

<Page>

action necessary to include such language, if such language was not included in
the initial registration statement, or revise such language if deemed reasonably
necessary by such Holder to effect such Partner Distribution.

          (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.1(a),
the Demand Registration rights granted in Section 2.1(a) to the Holders are
subject to the following limitations: (i) the Company shall not be required to
cause a registration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) to be declared effective
within a period of 180 days after the effective date of any other registration
statement of the Company filed pursuant to the Securities Act; (ii) if the Board
of Directors of the Company, in its good faith judgment, determines that any
registration of Registrable Securities should not be made or continued because
it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition,
corporate reorganization or merger or other transaction or event involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (a "Valid Business Reason"), the Company may
postpone filing a registration statement relating to a Demand Registration
Request until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for
more than three months (such period of postponement or withdrawal under this
clause (ii), the "Postponement Period"); and the Company shall give written
notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a registration statement and
of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or withdrawal
no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, the Company shall not be permitted to postpone or withdraw a
registration statement after the expiration of any Postponement Period until
twelve months after the expiration of such Postponement Period; (iii) the
Company shall not be obligated to effect more than three Demand Registrations
under Section 2.1(a) for the Holders, and (iv) the Company shall not be required
to effect a Demand Registration unless the Registrable Securities to be included
in such registration have an aggregate anticipated offering price of at least
$25,000,000 (based on the then-current market price of the Registrable
Securities).

          If the Company shall give any notice of postponement or withdrawal of
any registration statement pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall not,
during the period of postponement or withdrawal, register any equity security of
the Company, other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8
(or an equivalent registration form then in effect). Each Holder of Registrable
Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company that the
Company has determined to withdraw any registration statement pursuant to clause
(ii) above, such Holder will discontinue its disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement and, if so directed by the
Company, will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies,
other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession of the
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that was in effect at the time
of receipt of such notice. If the Company shall have withdrawn or prematurely
terminated a registration statement filed under Section 2.1(a)(i) (whether
pursuant to clause (ii) above or as a result of any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or
court), the Company shall not be considered to have effected an effective
registration for the purposes of this Agreement until the Company shall have
filed a new registration statement covering the Registrable Securities covered

<Page>

by the withdrawn registration statement and such registration statement shall
have been declared effective and shall not have been withdrawn. If the Company
shall give any notice of withdrawal or postponement of a registration statement,
the Company shall, at such time as the Valid Business Reason that caused such
withdrawal or postponement no longer exists (but in no event later than three
months after the date of the postponement or withdrawal), use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of
the Registrable Securities covered by the withdrawn or postponed registration
statement in accordance with this Section 2.1 (unless the Initiating Holders
shall have withdrawn such request, in which case the Company shall not be
considered to have effected an effective registration for the purposes of this
Agreement).

          (c)      The Company, subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6, may elect to
include in any registration statement and offering made pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i), (i) authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of
Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares and (ii) any other shares of
Common Stock which are requested to be included in such registration pursuant to
the exercise of piggyback rights granted by the Company which are not
inconsistent with the rights granted in, or otherwise conflict with the terms
of, this Agreement ("Additional Piggyback Rights"); provided, however, that such
inclusion shall be permitted only to the extent that it is pursuant to and
subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement or arrangements, if any,
entered into by the Participating Holders.

          (d)      In connection with any Demand Registration, the Company shall
have the right to designate the lead managing underwriter in connection with
such registration and each other managing underwriter for such registration,
provided that in each case, each such underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to
the Majority Participating Holders.

     2.2.       Piggyback Registrations.

          (a)      If, at any time, the Company proposes or is required to
register any of its equity securities under the Securities Act (other than
pursuant to (i) registrations on such form or similar form(s) solely for
registration of securities in connection with an employee benefit plan or
dividend reinvestment plan or a merger or consolidation or (ii) a Demand
Registration under Section 2.1) on a registration statement on Form S-1, Form
S-2 or Form S-3 (or an equivalent general registration form then in effect),
whether or not for its own account, the Company shall give prompt written notice
of its intention to do so to each of the Holders of record of Registrable
Securities. Upon the written request of any such Holder, made within 15 days
following the receipt of any such written notice (which request shall specify
the maximum number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such
Holder and the intended method of distribution thereof), the Company shall,
subject to Sections 2.2(b), 2.3 and 2.6 hereof, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities, the holders of which have so
requested the registration thereof, to be included in the registration statement
with the securities which the Company at the time proposes to register to permit
the sale or other disposition by the Holders (in accordance with the intended
method of distribution thereof) of the Registrable Securities to be so
registered. No registration of Registrable

<Page>

Securities effected under this Section 2.2(a) shall relieve the Company of its
obligations to effect Demand Registrations under Section 2.1 hereof.

          (b)      If, at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to register any equity securities and prior to the effective date of
the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration
of such equity securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice
of such determination to all Holders of record of Registrable Securities and (i)
in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
abandoned registration, without prejudice, however, to the rights of Holders
under Section 2.1, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay such
registration of its equity securities, shall be permitted to delay the
registration of such Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in
registering such other equity securities.

          (c)      Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request
for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement
pursuant to this Section 2.2 by giving written notice to the Company of its
request to withdraw; provided, however, that (i) such request must be made in
writing prior to the earlier of the execution of the underwriting agreement or
the execution of the custody agreement with respect to such registration and
(ii) such withdrawal shall be irrevocable and, after making such withdrawal, a
Holder shall no longer have any right to include Registrable Securities in the
registration as to which such withdrawal was made.

          (d)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Company shall, at the request of any Holder seeking to effect a Partner
Distribution, file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and to
otherwise take any action necessary to include such language, if such language
was not included in the initial registration statement, or revise such language
if deemed reasonably necessary by such Holder to effect such Partner
Distribution.

     2.3.       Allocation of Securities Included in Registration Statement.

          (a)      If any requested registration made pursuant to Section 2.1
involves an underwritten offering and the lead managing underwriter of such
offering (the "Manager") shall advise the Company that, in its view, the number
of securities requested to be included in such registration by the Holders of
Registrable Securities or any other persons (including those shares of Common
Stock requested by the Company to be included in such registration) exceeds the
largest number (the "Section 2.3(a) Sale Number") that can be sold in an orderly
manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the Majority
Participating Holders, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to include in such registration:

                (i)       first, all Registrable Securities and Berkshire/
Greenbriar Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration
by the holders thereof; provided, however, that, if the number of such
Registrable Securities and

<Page>

Berkshire/Greenbriar Registrable Securities exceeds the Section 2.3(a) Sale
Number, the number of such Registrable Securities and Berkshire/Greenbriar
Registrable Securities (not to exceed the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number) to be
included in such registration shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all
holders requesting that Registrable Securities and Berkshire/Greenbriar
Registrable Securities be included in such registration, based on the number of
Registrable Securities and Berkshire/Greenbriar Registrable Securities then
owned by each such holder requesting inclusion in relation to the number of
Registrable Securities and Berkshire/Greenbriar Registrable Securities owned by
all holders requesting inclusion;

                (ii)      second, to the extent that the number of securities to
be included pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.3(a) is less than the
Section 2.3(a) Sale Number, the remaining shares to be included in such
registration shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all holders requesting
that securities be included in such registration pursuant to the exercise of
Additional Piggyback Rights ("Piggyback Shares"), based on the aggregate number
of Piggyback Shares then owned by each holder requesting inclusion in relation
to the aggregate number of Piggyback Shares owned by all holders requesting
inclusion, up to the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number; and

                (iii)     third, to the extent that the number of securities to
be included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.3(a) is less than
the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number, any securities that the Company proposes to
register, up to the Section 2.3(a) Sale Number.

          If, as a result of the proration provisions of this Section 2.3(a),

the Company will furnish to one counsel for the Holders participating in the

Securities owned by such seller (the Company hereby consenting to the use in
accordance with all applicable law of each such registration statement (or
amendment or post-effective amendment thereto) and each such prospectus (or

prospectus supplement related thereto or post-effective amendment to the
registration statement has been filed and, with respect to the registration
statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective;
(ii) of any request by the SEC or state securities authority for amendments or
supplements to the registration statement or the prospectus related thereto or
for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any

statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading;

registration statement to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the
principal securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company

permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (ii) if no similar securities are
then so listed, to either cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on
a national securities exchange or to secure designation of all such Registrable
Securities as a Nasdaq National Market "national market system security" within
the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 of the Exchange Act or, failing that, secure Nasdaq

generality of the foregoing, take all actions that may be required by the
Company as the issuer of such Registrable Securities in order to facilitate the
managing underwriter's arranging for the registration of at least two market
makers as such with

<Page>

respect to such shares with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

offering shall reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the

of the Registrable Securities which are to be distributed by any underwriters
shall be parties to any such underwriting agreement and may, at their option,
require that the Company make to and for the benefit of such Holders the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company which are being made to
and for the benefit of such underwriters);

          (j)      use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
opinion from the Company's counsel and a "cold comfort" letter from the
Company's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such
matters as are customarily covered by such opinions and "cold comfort" letters
delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings, which opinion and
letter shall be reasonably satisfactory to the underwriter, if any, and furnish
to each Holder participating in the offering and to each underwriter, if any, a
copy of such opinion and letter addressed to such Holder or underwriter;

          (k)      deliver promptly to each Holder participating in the
offering and each underwriter, if any, copies of all correspondence between the
SEC and the Company, its counsel or auditors and all memoranda relating to
discussions with the SEC or its staff with respect to the registration
statement, other than those portions of any such memoranda which contain
information subject to attorney-client privilege with respect to the Company,
and, upon receipt of such confidentiality agreements as the Company may
reasonably request, make reasonably available for inspection by any seller of
such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, by any
underwriter, if any, participating in any disposition to be effected pursuant to
such registration statement and by any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by any such seller or any such underwriter, all pertinent financial and
other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and

reasonable assistance to the underwriters (taking into account the needs of the
Company's businesses and the requirements of the marketing process) in the
marketing of Registrable Securities in any underwritten offering;

          (o)      promptly prior to the filing of any document which is to be
incorporated by reference into the registration statement or the prospectus
(after the initial filing of such registration statement) provide copies of such
document to counsel for the selling holders of Registrable Securities and to
each managing underwriter, if any, and make the Company's representatives
reasonably available for discussion of such document and make such changes in
such document concerning the selling holders prior to the filing thereof as
counsel for such selling holders or underwriters may reasonably request;

          (p)      furnish to the Holder participating in the offering and the
managing underwriter, without charge, at least one signed copy, and to each
other Holder participating in the offering, without charge, at least one
photocopy of a signed copy, of the registration statement and any post-effective
amendments thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents
incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits (including those incorporated
by reference);

          (q)      cooperate with the sellers of Registrable Securities and the
managing underwriter, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery
of certificates not bearing any restrictive legends representing the Registrable
Securities to be sold, and cause such Registrable Securities to be issued in
such denominations and registered in such names in accordance with the
underwriting agreement prior to any sale of Registrable Securities to the
underwriters or, if not an underwritten offering, in accordance with the
instructions of the sellers of Registrable Securities at least three business
days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities and instruct any transfer agent
and registrar of Registrable Securities to release any stop transfer orders in
respect thereof;

          (r)      take all such other commercially reasonable actions as are
necessary or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities; and

          (s)      take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that to the extent that any
prohibition is applicable to the Company, the Company will take such action as
is necessary to make any such prohibition inapplicable.

          The Company may require as a condition precedent to the Company's
obligations under this Section 2.4 that each seller of Registrable Securities as
to which any registration is being effected furnish the Company such information
in writing regarding such seller and the distribution of such Registrable
Securities as the Company

<Page>

may from time to time reasonably request provided that such information is
necessary for the Company to consummate such registration and shall be used only
in connection with such registration.

          Each seller of Registrable Securities agrees that upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
clause (v) of paragraph (e) of this Section 2.4, such seller will discontinue
such seller's disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement covering such Registrable Securities until such seller's receipt of
the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by paragraph
(e) of this Section 2.4 and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the
Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies,
then in such seller's possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities that was in effect at the time of receipt of such notice. In the
event the Company shall give any such notice, the applicable period mentioned in
paragraph (b) of this Section 2.4 shall be extended by the number of days during
such period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and
including the date when each seller of any Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended prospectus contemplated by paragraph (e) of this Section 2.4.

          If any such registration statement or comparable statement under "blue
sky" laws refers to any Holder by name or otherwise as the Holder of any
securities of the Company, then such Holder shall have the right to require (i)
the insertion therein of language, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to such Holder and the Company, to the effect that the holding by such Holder of
such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by such Holder of the
investment quality of the Company's securities covered thereby and that such
holding does not imply that such Holder will assist in meeting any future
financial requirements of the Company, or (ii) in the event that such reference
to such Holder by name or otherwise is not in the judgment of the Company, as
advised by counsel, required by the Securities Act or any similar federal
statute or any state "blue sky" or securities law then in force, the deletion of
the reference to such Holder.

     2.5.       Registration Expenses.

          (a)      The Company shall pay all Expenses (x) with respect to any
Demand Registration whether or not it becomes effective or remains effective for
the period contemplated by Section 2.4(b) and (y) with respect to any
registration effected under Section 2.2.

          (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the provisions of this
Section 2.5 shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to cause these
expense provisions to comply with "blue sky" laws of each state in which the
offering is made and (y) in connection with any registration hereunder, each
Holder of Registrable Securities being registered shall pay all underwriting
discounts and commissions and any transfer taxes, if any, attributable to the
sale of such Registrable Securities, pro rata with respect to

<Page>

payments of discounts and commissions in accordance with the number of shares
sold in the offering by such Holder, and (z) the Company shall, in the case of
all registrations under this Article 2, be responsible for all its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties).

     2.6.       Certain Limitations on Registration Rights. In the case of any
registration under Section 2.1 pursuant to an underwritten offering, or, in the
case of a registration under Section 2.2, if the Company has determined to enter
into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all securities to be
included in such registration shall be subject to an underwriting agreement and
no Person may participate in such registration unless such Person agrees to sell
such Person's securities on the basis provided therein and, subject to Section
3.1 hereof, completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, and other
documents (including custody agreements and powers of attorney) which must be
executed in connection therewith, and provides such other information to the
Company or the underwriter as may be necessary to register such Person's
securities.

     2.7.       Limitations on Sale or Distribution of Other Securities. (a)
Each seller of Registrable Securities agrees that, (i) to the extent requested
in writing by a managing underwriter, if any, of any registration effected
pursuant to Section 2.1, not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of,
including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, any Common
Stock, or any other equity security of the Company or any security convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the Company
(other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the time period
reasonably requested by the managing underwriter, not to exceed 90 days (and the
Company hereby also so agrees (except that the Company may effect any sale or
distribution of any such securities pursuant to a registration on Form S-4 (if
reasonably acceptable to such managing underwriter) or Form S-8, or any
successor or similar form which is then in effect or upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of any then outstanding Common Stock Equivalent) to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of any equity security or
any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity
security of the Company purchased from the Company at any time other than in a
public offering so to agree), and (ii) to the extent requested in writing by a
managing underwriter of any underwritten public offering effected by the Company
for its own account it will not sell any Common Stock (other than as part of
such underwritten public offering) during the time period reasonably requested
by the managing underwriter, which period shall not exceed 90 days.

          (b)      The Company hereby agrees that, if it shall previously have
received a request for registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, and if such
previous registration shall not have been withdrawn or abandoned, the Company
shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock, or any
other equity security of the Company or any security convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the Company (other than
as part of such underwritten public offering, a registration on Form S-4 or Form
S-8 or any successor or similar form which is then in effect or upon the

<Page>

conversion, exchange or exercise of any then outstanding Common Stock
Equivalent), until a period of 90 days shall have elapsed from the effective
date of such previous registration; and the Company shall so provide in any
registration rights agreements hereafter entered into with respect to any of its
securities.

     2.8.       No Required Sale. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
create an independent obligation on the part of any Holder to sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any effective registration statement.

     2.9.       Indemnification. (a) In the event of any registration of any
securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this Article 2,
the Company will, and hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its
directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees, stockholders, members or general
and limited partners (and the directors, officers, employees and stockholders
thereof), each other Person who participates as an underwriter or a Qualified
Independent Underwriter, if any, in the offering or sale of such securities,
each officer, director, employee, stockholder, fiduciary, managing director,
agent, affiliates, consultants, representatives, successors, assigns or partner
of such underwriter or Qualified Independent Underwriter, and each other Person,
if any, who controls such Holder or any such underwriter within the meaning of
the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel and any amounts
paid in any settlement effected with the Company's consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to which each such indemnified party
may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise in respect thereof
(collectively, "Claims"), insofar as such Claims arise out of or are based upon
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any registration statement under which such securities were
registered under the Securities Act or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, together with the documents
incorporated by reference therein, or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation by the Company of any federal,
state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to
action required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such
registration, and the Company will reimburse any such indemnified party for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claim as such expenses are
incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any such
indemnified party in any such case to the extent such Claim arises out of or is
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made in such registration
statement or amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any such prospectus
or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus in reliance upon and in

<Page>

conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of
such indemnified party specifically for use therein. Such indemnity and
reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by as on behalf of such indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder.

          (b)      Each Holder of Registrable Securities that are included in
the securities as to which any registration under Section 2.1 or 2.2 is being
effected shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless (in the
same manner and to the same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section
2.9) to the extent permitted by law the Company, its officers and directors,
each Person controlling the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and
all other prospective sellers and their respective directors, officers,
fiduciaries, managing directors, employees, agents, affiliates, consultants,
representatives, successors, assigns, general and limited partners, stockholders
and respective controlling Persons with respect to any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact in, or omission or alleged
omission of any material fact from, such registration statement, any
preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company or its representatives by or on behalf of
such Holder specifically for use therein and reimburse such indemnified party
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending any such Claim as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however, that the aggregate amount which any such Holder shall be
required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) and Sections 2.9(c), (e) and (f)
shall in no case be greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement giving rise to such claim. Such indemnity and reimbursement of
expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of
such securities by such Holder.

          (c)      Indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.9 (with appropriate modifications)
shall be given by the Company and each seller of Registrable Securities with
respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under
any state securities and "blue sky" laws.

          (d)      Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
shall notify promptly the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of
any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may
be made pursuant to this Section 2.9, but the failure of any such Person to
provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
under the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.9, except to the extent the
indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby and shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any such Person
otherwise than under this Article 2. In case any action or proceeding is brought
against an indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the

<Page>

commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the
indemnified party a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, to assume the defense
thereof jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the
extent that it chooses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
that it so chooses, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, that (i) if the indemnifying party
fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or
proceeding within 20 days after receiving notice from such indemnified party; or
(ii) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding
which is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably shall have
concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such
indemnified party which are not available to the indemnifying party; or (iii) if
representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in any such case, the
indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense as
set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all indemnified
parties in each jurisdiction, except to the extent any indemnified party or
parties reasonably shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to such party or parties which are not available to the other
indemnified parties or to the extent representation of all indemnified parties
by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct) and the indemnifying party shall be liable for any
expenses therefor. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of
the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect
the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim)
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) includes an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action
or claim and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

          (e)      If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable
or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 2.9(a),
(b) or (c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of any Claim in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such
offering of securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. If, however, the
allocation provided in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by
applicable law, then each indemnifying

<Page>

party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults
but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this
Section 2.9(e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the preceding sentences of this Section 2.9(e). The amount paid
or payable in respect of any Claim shall be deemed to include any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such Claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything in this section 2.9(e) to
the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall be required
pursuant to this section 2.9(e) to contribute any amount in excess of the net
proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the sale of Registrable
Securities in the offering to which the losses, claims, damages or liabilities
of the indemnified parties relate, less the amount of any indemnification
payment made by such indemnifying party pursuant to Sections 2.9(b) and (c).

          (f)      The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein
shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution
which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of the Registrable Securities by any such party.

          (g)      The indemnification and contribution required by this
Section 2.9 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the
course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

3.   Underwritten Offerings.

     3.1.       Requested Underwritten Offerings. If requested by the
underwriters for any underwritten offering by the Investors pursuant to a
registration requested under Section 2.1, the Company shall enter into a
customary underwriting agreement with the underwriters. Such underwriting
agreement shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Majority
Participating Holders and shall contain such representations and warranties by,
and such other agreements on the part of, the Company and such other terms as
are generally prevailing in agreements of that type, including, without
limitation, indemnities and contribution agreements on substantially the same
terms as those contained herein. Any Holder participating in the offering shall
be a party to such underwriting agreement and may, at its option, require that
any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on
the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also
be made to and for the benefit of such Holder and that any or all

<Page>

of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such
Holder; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties with respect to written information specifically
provided by a selling Holder for inclusion in the registration statement. Each
such Holder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to
or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, its ownership of and title to
the Registrable Securities, and its intended method of distribution; and any
liability of such Holder to any underwriter or other Person under such
underwriting agreement shall be limited to liability arising from breach of its
representations and warranties and shall be limited to an amount equal to the
proceeds (net of expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions) that it
derives from such registration.

     3.2.       Piggyback Underwritten Offerings. In the case of a registration
pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, if the Company shall have determined to enter
into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, any Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration shall be subject to such
underwriting agreement. Any Holder participating in such registration may, at
its option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by,
and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of
such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such Holder and
that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the
obligations of such Holder. Each such Holder shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such
Holder, its ownership of and title to the Registrable Securities, and its
intended method of distribution; and any liability of such Holder to any
underwriter or other Person under such underwriting agreement shall be limited
to liability arising from breach of its representations and warranties and shall
be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds (net of expenses and underwriting
discounts and commissions) that it derives from such registration.

4.   General.

     4.1.       Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities. The Company agrees
that it shall not effect or permit to occur any combination or subdivision of
shares of Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock which would adversely affect the ability of any
Holder of any Registrable Securities to include such Registrable Securities in
any registration contemplated by this Agreement or the marketability of such
Registrable Securities in any such registration. The Company agrees that it will
take all reasonable steps necessary to effect a subdivision of shares if in the
reasonable judgment of (a) the Majority Participating Holders or (b) the
managing underwriter for the offering in respect of such Demand Registration
Request, such subdivision would enhance the marketability of the Registrable
Securities. Each Holder agrees to vote all of its shares of capital stock in a
manner, and to take all other actions necessary, to permit the Company to carry
out the intent of the preceding sentence including, without limitation, voting
in favor of an amendment to the Company's

<Page>

Certificate of Incorporation in order to increase the number of authorized
shares of capital stock of the Company.

     4.2.       Rule 144. The Company covenants that (i) so long as it remains
subject to the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, it will timely file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(including, but not limited to, the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act), and (ii) will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable
Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time
to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A) Rule
144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or
(B) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the
request of any Holder of Registrable Securities, the Company will deliver to
such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements.

     4.3.       Nominees for Beneficial Owners. If Registrable Securities are
held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof
may, at its option, be treated as the Holder of such Registrable Securities for
purposes of any request or other action by any Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement (or any determination of any number or
percentage of shares constituting Registrable Securities held by any Holder or
Holders of Registrable Securities contemplated by this Agreement), provided that
the Company shall have received assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such
beneficial ownership.

     4.4.       Amendments and Waivers. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement may be modified or amended, or any of the provisions hereof waived,
temporarily or permanently, in a writing executed and delivered by the Company
and each of the Holders. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof
(whether or not similar). No delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

     4.5.       Notices. All notices, requests, consents and other
communications hereunder to any party shall be deemed to be sufficient if
contained in a written instrument delivered in person or sent by telecopy,
nationally recognized overnight courier or first class registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to such party at the

     4.6.       Miscellaneous.

          (a)      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and the respective
successors, personal representatives and assigns of the parties hereto, whether
so expressed or not. If any Person shall acquire Registrable Securities from any
Holder, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, but in
compliance with the Governance Agreement, such Person shall promptly notify the
Company and such Registrable Securities acquired from such Holder shall be held
subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such
Registrable Securities such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits of
and be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any such successor or assign shall
agree in writing to acquire and hold the Registrable Securities acquired from
such Holder subject to all of the terms hereof. If any Holder shall acquire
additional Registrable Securities, such Registrable Securities shall be subject
to all of the terms, and entitled to all the benefits, of this Agreement.

          (b)      This Agreement (with the documents referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto), together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the
Governance Agreement, embodies the entire agreement and understanding between
the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements, including, without
limitation, the 2000 Registration Rights Agreement, and understandings relating
to the subject matter hereof.

          (c)      THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF).

          (d)      With respect to any suit, action or proceeding ("PROCEEDING")
arising out of or relating to this Agreement each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or the Court of Chancery
located in the State of Delaware, County of Newcastle (the "SELECTED COURTS")
and waives any objection to venue being laid in the Selected Courts whether
based on the grounds of forum non conveniens or otherwise and hereby agrees not
to commence any such Proceeding other than before one of the Selected Courts;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a party may commence any Proceeding in a court other
than a Selected Court solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment
issued by one of the Selected Courts and (ii) consents to service of process in
any Proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, or by recognized international express carrier or delivery
service, to the Company or the Investors at their respective addresses referred
to in Section 4.5 hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall affect
the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law.

<Page>

          (e)      WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY, TO THE EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, AND AGREES THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

          (f)      The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. All
section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise expressly provided.

          (g)      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one instrument.

          (h)      Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid
or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

          (i)      The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
and other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any of the Selected
Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with
respect to such remedy are hereby waived by each of the parties hereto. Each
party further agrees that, in the event of any action for an injunction or other
equitable remedy in respect of such breach or enforcement of specific
performance, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

<Page>

          (j)      Each party hereto shall do and perform or cause to be done
and performed all such further acts and things and shall execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents as any other
party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     4.7.       No Inconsistent Agreements. Subject to the provisions of any
agreement set forth on Schedule 4.7 hereof, the rights granted to the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not
inconsistent with any other agreements to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound. Without the prior written consent of Holders of a majority of
the then outstanding Registrable Securities, the Company will not, on or after
the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its
securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted in this Agreement or
otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof or provides terms and conditions
which are more favorable to, or less restrictive on, the other party thereto
than the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement are (insofar as they
are applicable) to the Holders, other than (i) the Registration Rights
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between the Company and the
Berkshire/Greenbriar Investors and (ii) any lock-up agreement with the
underwriters in connection with any registered offering effected hereunder,
pursuant to which the Company shall agree not to register for sale, and the
Company shall agree not to sell or otherwise dispose of, Common Stock or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, for
a specified period following the registered offering. The Company further agrees
that if any other registration rights agreement entered into after the date of
this Agreement with respect to any of its securities contains terms which are
more favorable to, or less restrictive on, the other party thereto than the
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement are (insofar as they are
applicable) to the Holders, then the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall immediately be deemed to have been amended without further action by the
Company or any of the Holders of Registrable Securities so that the Holders
shall each be entitled to the benefit of any such more favorable or less
restrictive terms or conditions.

<Page>

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this
agreement as of the date first above written.
