          Underwritten registration or underwritten offering: A registration in

2.   Exchange Offer

          (a) Each of the Issuers agrees to file with the Commission no later
than the Filing Date, an offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") any and all of
the Registrable Notes (other than Private Exchange Notes, if any) for a like
aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Company which are identical
in all material respects to the Notes (the "Exchange Notes") (and which are
entitled to the benefits of the Indenture or a trust indenture which is
identical in all material respects to the Indenture (including, without
limitation, the guarantee provisions thereof) (other than such changes to the
Indenture or any such identical trust indenture as are necessary to comply with
any requirements of the Commission to effect or maintain the qualification
thereof under the TIA) and which, in either case, has been qualified under the
TIA), except that the Exchange Notes shall have been registered pursuant to an
effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act and shall contain no
restrictive legend thereon. The Exchange Offer shall be registered under the
Securities Act on the appropriate form (the "Exchange Registration Statement")
and shall comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under
the Exchange Act. Each of the Issuers agrees to use its best efforts to (x)
cause the Exchange Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act on or before the Effectiveness Date; (y) keep the Exchange Offer
open for at least 30 Business Days (or longer if required by applicable law)
after the date that notice of the Exchange Offer is first mailed to Holders; and
(z) consummate the Exchange Offer on or prior to the 60th day following the date
on which the Exchange Registration Statement is declared effective. If after
such Exchange Registration Statement is initially declared effective by the
Commission, the Exchange Offer or the issuance of the Exchange Notes thereunder
is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement
of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, such Exchange
Registration Statement shall be deemed not to have become effective for purposes
of this Agreement. Each Holder who participates in the Exchange Offer will be
required to represent that any Exchange Notes received by it will be acquired in
the ordinary

<PAGE>
END

                                      -7-

course of its business, that at the time of the consummation of the Exchange
Offer such Holder will have no arrangement or understanding with any Person to
participate in the distribution of the Exchange Notes, that such Holder is not
an affiliate of any Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any
additional representations that in the written opinion of counsel to the Company
are necessary under then-existing interpretations of the Commission in order for
the Exchange Registration Statement to be declared effective. Upon consummation
of the Exchange Offer in accordance with this Section 2, the provisions of this
Agreement shall continue to apply, mutatis mutandis, solely with respect to
Registrable Notes that are Private Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes held by
Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Issuers shall have no further obligation
to register Registrable Notes (other than Private Exchange Notes and other than
in respect of any Exchange Notes as to which clause 2(c)(iv) hereof applies)
pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement.

          (b) The Issuers shall include within the Prospectus contained in the
Exchange Registration Statement a section entitled "Plan of Distribution,"
reasonably acceptable to the Initial Purchasers, which shall contain a summary
statement of the positions taken or policies made by the Staff of the Commission
with respect to the potential "underwriter" status of any broker-dealer that is
the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
Exchange Notes received by such broker-dealer in the Exchange Offer (a
"Participating Broker-Dealer"), whether such positions or policies have been
publicly disseminated by the Staff of the Commission or such positions or
policies, in the judgment of the Initial Purchasers, represent the prevailing
views of the Staff of the Commission. Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall
also allow, to the extent permitted by applicable policies and regulations of
the Commission, the use of the Prospectus by all Persons subject to the
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including, to the extent
so permitted, all Participating Broker-Dealers, and include a statement
describing the manner in which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the
Exchange Notes.

          Each of the Issuers shall use its best efforts to keep the Exchange
Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the Prospectus
contained therein, in order to permit such Prospectus to be lawfully delivered
by all Persons

<PAGE>
END

                                      -8-

subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such
period of time beginning when the Exchange Notes are first issued in the
Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day
after the Exchange Offer has been completed and such Persons are no longer
required to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements in connection with
offers and sales of the Exchange Notes (the "Applicable Period").

          If, upon consummation of the Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser
holds any Notes acquired by it and having the status of an unsold allotment in
the initial distribution, the Issuers upon the request of such Initial Purchaser
shall, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Notes in the Exchange
Offer, issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "Private
Exchange") for the Notes held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount
of debt securities of the Company that are identical in all material respects to
the Exchange Notes except for the existence of restrictions on transfer thereof
under the Securities Act and securities laws of the several states of the U.S.
(the "Private Exchange Notes") (and which are issued pursuant to the same
indenture as the Exchange Notes). The Private Exchange Notes shall bear the same
CUSIP number as the Exchange Notes. Interest on the Exchange Notes and Private
Exchange Notes will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest
was paid on the Notes surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has
been paid on the Notes, from the Issue Date.

          In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuers shall:

          (1) mail to each Holder a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the
     Exchange Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of
     transmittal and related documents;

          (2) utilize the services of a depositary for the Exchange Offer with
     an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be
     the Trustee or an affiliate thereof;

          (3) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Registrable Notes at any time
     prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last Business Day on
     which the Exchange Offer shall remain open; and

<PAGE>
END

                                      -9-

          (4) otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable
     laws.

          As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer or the
Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Issuers shall:

          (1) accept for exchange all Registrable Notes validly tendered and not
     validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange;

          (2) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Notes so
     accepted for exchange; and

          (3) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each
     Holder tendering such Registrable Notes, Exchange Notes or Private Exchange
     Notes, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Notes of such
     Holder so accepted for exchange.

          The Exchange Notes and the Private Exchange Notes may be issued under
(i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical in all material respects to the
Indenture, which in either event will provide that the Exchange Notes will not
be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that the
Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes and the Notes, if any, will vote and
consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange
Notes, the Private Exchange Notes or the Notes, if any, will have the right to
vote or consent as a separate class on any matter.

          (c) If, (i) because of any change in law or in currently prevailing
interpretations of the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to
effect an Exchange Offer, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 180
days of the Issue Date, (iii) any holder of Private Exchange Notes so requests
in writing to the Company or (iv) in the case of any Holder that participates in
the Exchange Offer (and tenders its Registrable Notes prior to the expiration
thereof), such Holder does not receive Exchange Notes on the date of the
exchange that may be sold without restriction under federal securities laws
(other than due solely to the status of such Holder as an affiliate of any
Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act) and so notifies the Company
within 30 days following the consummation of the Exchange Offer (and providing a
reasonable basis for its conclusions), in the case of each of

<PAGE>
END

                                      -10-

clauses (i)-(iv), then the Issuers shall promptly deliver to the Holders and the
Trustee written notice thereof (the "Shelf Notice") and shall file a Shelf
Registration pursuant to Section 3.

3.   Shelf Registration

          If a Shelf Notice is delivered as contemplated by Section 2(c), then:

          (a) Shelf Registration. The Issuers shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable file with the Commission a Registration Statement for an offering to
be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the
Registrable Notes (the "Initial Shelf Registration"). If the Issuers shall not
have yet filed the Exchange Registration Statement, each of the Issuers shall
file with the Commission the Initial Shelf Registration on or prior to the
Filing Date and shall use its best efforts to cause such Initial Shelf
Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or prior to
the Effectiveness Date. Otherwise, each of the Issuers shall file with the
Commission the Initial Shelf Registration within 45 days of the delivery of the
Shelf Notice and shall use its best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration to
be declared effective under the Securities Act on or prior to the Effectiveness
Date. The Initial Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-1 or another appropriate
form permitting registration of such Registrable Notes for resale by Holders in
the manner or manners designated by them (including, without limitation, one or
more underwritten offerings). The Issuers shall not permit any securities other
than the Registrable Notes to be included in any Shelf Registration. Each of the
Issuers shall use its best efforts to keep the Initial Shelf Registration
continuously effective under the Securities Act until the date which is 24
months from the Issue Date (or, if Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act is
amended to permit unlimited resales by non-affiliates within a lesser period,
such lesser period) (subject to extension pursuant to the last paragraph of
Section 5 hereof) (the "Effectiveness Period") or such shorter period ending
when (i) all Registrable Notes covered by the Initial Shelf Registration have
been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Initial Shelf
Registration or (ii) a Subsequent Shelf Registration covering all of the
Registrable Notes has been declared effective under the Securities Act.

<PAGE>
END

                                      -11-

          (b) Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the Initial Shelf Registration
or any Subsequent Shelf Registration ceases to be effective for any reason at
any time during the Effectiveness Period (other than because of the sale of all
of the securities registered thereunder), each of the Issuers shall use its best
efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall within 30 days of such cessation
of effectiveness amend the Shelf Registration in a manner to obtain the
withdrawal of the order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an
additional "shelf" Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of
the Registrable Notes (a "Subsequent Shelf Registration"). If a Subsequent Shelf
Registration is filed, each of the Issuers shall use its best efforts to cause
the Subsequent Shelf Registration to be declared effective as soon as
practicable after such filing and to keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration
continuously effective for a period equal to the number of days in the
Effectiveness Period less the aggregate number of days during which the Initial
Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf Registrations was previously
continuously effective. As used herein the term "Shelf Registration" means the
Initial Shelf Registration and any Subsequent Shelf Registration.

          (c) Supplements and Amendments. Each of the Issuers shall promptly
supplement and amend any Shelf Registration if required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such
Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or if reasonably
requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Registrable Notes covered by such Shelf Registration or by any underwriter of
such Registrable Notes, in each case, with each Issuer's consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

4.   Additional Interest

          (a) The Issuers and the Initial Purchasers agree that the Holders of
Registrable Notes will suffer damages if the Issuers fail to fulfill their
obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it would not be
feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly,
each of the Issuers agrees to pay, as liquidated damages, additional interest on
the Registrable Notes ("Additional Interest") under the circumstances and to the

<PAGE>
END

                                      -12-

extent set forth below (each of which shall be given independent effect):

          (i) if (A) neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the Initial
     Shelf Registration has been filed on or prior to the Filing Date or (B)
     notwithstanding that the Issuers have consummated or will consummate an
     Exchange Offer, the Issuers are required to file a Shelf Registration and
     such Shelf Registration is not filed on or prior to the 45th day after
     delivery of the Shelf Notice, then, in the case of subclause (A),
     commencing on the day after the Filing Date or, in the case of subclause
     (B), commencing on the 46th day following delivery of the Shelf Notice,
     Additional Interest shall accrue on the Registrable Notes over and above
     the stated interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days
     immediately following the Filing Date or such 45th day, as the case may be,
     such Additional Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum
     at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period;

          (ii) if (A) neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the
     Initial Shelf Registration is declared effective on or prior to the
     Effectiveness Date applicable thereto or (B) notwithstanding that the
     Issuers have consummated or will consummate an Exchange Offer, the Issuers
     are required to file a Shelf Registration and such Shelf Registration is
     not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable
     Effectiveness Date, then, commencing on the day after such applicable
     Effectiveness Date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the Registrable
     Notes over and above the stated interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for
     the first 90 days immediately following the day after the applicable
     Effectiveness Date, such Additional Interest rate increasing by an
     additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day

     tion ceases to be effective at any time during the Effectiveness Period,
     then Additional Interest shall accrue on the Registrable Notes over and
     above the stated interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90
     days commencing on the (x) 271st day after the Issue Date in the case of
     (A) above or (y) the day such Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf
     Registration ceases to be effective in the case of (B) and (C) above, such
     Additional Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at the
     beginning of each such subsequent 90-day period;

provided, however, that the Additional Interest rate on the Registrable Notes
may not exceed in the aggregate 1.0% per annum; provided further that (1) upon
the filing of the Exchange Registration Statement or each Shelf Registration (in
the case of (i) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Registration
Statement or each Shelf Registration, as the case may be (in the case of (ii)
above), or (3) upon the exchange of Exchange Notes for all Registrable Notes
tendered (in the case of (iii)(A) above) or upon the effectiveness of an
Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration which had ceased to remain
effective (in the case of (iii)(B) and (C) above), Additional Interest on any
Registrable Notes then accruing Additional Interest as a result of such clause
(or the relevant subclause thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue.

          (b) The Issuers shall notify the Trustee within one Business Day after
each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Additional
Interest is required to be paid (an "Event Date"). Any amounts of Additional
Interest due pursuant to (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 4 will be
payable in cash semi-annually on each regular interest payment date specified in
the Indenture (to the Holders of Registrable Notes of record on the regular
record date therefor (as specified in the Indenture) immediately preceding such
dates), commencing with the first such regular interest payment date occurring
after any such Additional Interest commences to accrue. The amount of Additional
Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest
rate by the principal amount of the Notes subject thereto, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest
rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.

5.   Registration Procedures

          In connection with the filing of any Registration Statement pursuant
to Sections 2 or 3 hereof, each Issuer shall effect such registrations to permit
the sale of such securities covered thereby in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection
with any Registration Statement filed by each Issuer hereunder, each Issuer
shall:

          (a) Prepare and file with the Commission prior to the Filing Date, the
Exchange Registration Statement or if the Exchange Registration Statement is not
filed or is unavailable, a Shelf Registration as prescribed by Section 2 or 3,
and use its best efforts to cause each such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided that, if (1) a Shelf
Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2) a Prospectus contained in an
Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks
to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period and has advised the Company
that it is a Participating Broker-Dealer, before filing any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Issuers
shall, if requested, furnish to and afford the Holders of the Registrable Notes
to be registered pursuant to such Shelf Registration or each such Participating
Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, covered by such Registration Statement, their
counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to
review copies of all such documents (including copies of any documents to be
incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto) proposed to be filed
(in each case at least five Business Days prior to such filing). The Issuers
shall not file any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments

managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object.

          (b) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and

Statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement

Exchange Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities
covered by such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so
supplemented and with respect to the subsequent resale of any securities being
sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer covered by any such Prospectus. The
Issuers shall be deemed not to have used their best efforts to keep a
Registration Statement effective during the Applicable Period if they
voluntarily take any action that would result in selling Holders of the
Registrable Notes covered thereby or Participating Broker-Dealers seeking to
sell Exchange Notes not being able to sell such Registrable Notes or such
Exchange Notes during that period unless such action is required by applicable
law, rule or regulation or unless the Issuers comply with this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the provisions of paragraph 5(k) hereof and the
last paragraph of Section 5.

          (c) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2)
a Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 2 is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any
Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the
Applicable Period from whom the Issuers have received written notice that it
will be a Participating Broker-Dealer, notify the selling Holders of Registrable
Notes, and each such Participating Broker-Dealer, their counsel and the managing
underwriters, if any, promptly (but in any event within two Business Days), and
confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective (including in such notice a written statement that any Holder may,
upon request, obtain, without charge, one conformed copy of such Registration
Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and
schedules, documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and
exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of a

<PAGE>

                                      -16-

Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any
preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
(iii) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be
delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable Notes the representations
and warranties of any Issuer contained in any agreement (including any
underwriting agreement contemplated by Section 5(n) hereof) cease to be true and
correct in any material respect, (iv) of the receipt by any Issuer of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of a Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Notes
or the Exchange Notes to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer for offer or
sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event, the existence of any condition
or any information becoming known that makes any statement made in such
Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
that requires the making of any changes in, or amendments or supplements to,
such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of
the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Issuers' reasonable determination
that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be
appropriate.

          (d) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2)
a Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 2 is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any
Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the
Applicable Period, use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification
(or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Notes or the
Exchange Notes to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer, for sale

to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible date.

          (e) If a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 and if
requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes being sold in connection
with an underwritten offering, (i) as promptly as practicable incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information or revisions

request to be included or made therein, (ii) make all required filings of such
prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable

managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of the
Registration Statement or Registration Statements and each post-effective
amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if
requested, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference and all exhibits.

          (g) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2)
a Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 2 is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any
Participating Broker-Dealer, deliver to each selling Holder of Registrable Notes
or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, their respective
counsel, and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the
Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of preliminary prospectus)

Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the
Applicable Period, use its best efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate
with the selling Holders of Registrable Notes and each such Participating

the case may be, for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of
such jurisdictions within the United States as any selling Holder, Participating
Broker-Dealer, or the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, reasonably
request in writing; provided that where Exchange Notes held by Participating
Broker-Dealers or Registrable Notes are offered pursuant to an underwritten
offering, counsel to the underwriters shall, at the cost and expense of the
Issuers, perform the Blue Sky investigations and file registrations and

where it is not then so subject.

          (i) If a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, cooperate
with the selling Holders of Registrable Notes, any Participating Broker-Dealer
and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely

agents) with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section.
The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement, or as
and to the extent required thereunder.

          (o) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3, or (2)
a Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 2 is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any
Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the

                                      -22-

in such Records has been made generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure or failure to safeguard by such Inspector or (iv)
disclosure of such information is, in the opinion of counsel for any Inspector,
necessary or advisable in connection with any action, claim, suit or proceeding,
directly or indirectly, involving or potentially involving such Inspector and
arising out of, based upon, related to, or involving this Agreement, or any
transactions contemplated hereby or arising hereunder. Each selling Holder of
such Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer will be required to
agree that information obtained by it as a result of such inspections shall be
deemed confidential and shall not be used by it as the basis for any market
transactions in the securities of any Issuer unless and until such is made
generally available to the public. Each Inspector, each selling Holder of such
Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer will be required to
further agree that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is
sought in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iv) of
the previous sentence or otherwise, give notice to the Issuers and allow the

first Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Notes; and in
connection therewith, cooperate with the trustee under any such indenture and
the Holders of the Registrable Notes, to effect such changes to such indenture
as may be required for such indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the
terms of the TIA; and execute, and use its best efforts to cause such trustee to
execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes, and all other
forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such
indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner.

          (q) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
and make generally available to its securityholders earnings statements
satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder

                                      -23-

(or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days
after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month
period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal
quarter in which Registrable Notes are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment
or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in
such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the
Company after the effective date of a Registration Statement, which statements
shall cover said 12-month periods.

          (r) Upon consummation of the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange,
obtain an opinion of counsel to the Issuers, in a form customary for
underwritten transactions, addressed to the Trustee for the benefit of all
Holders of Registrable Notes participating in the Exchange Offer or the Private
Exchange, as the case may be, that the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange
Notes, as the case may be, the Guarantees and the related indenture constitute
legally valid and binding obligations of the Issuers, enforceable against the
Issuers in accordance with their respective terms.

          (s) If the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated,
upon delivery of the Registrable Notes by Holders to the Issuers (or to such
other Person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the Exchange Notes or
the Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, the Issuers shall mark, or
caused to be marked, on such Registrable Notes that such Registrable Notes are
being cancelled in exchange for the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange
Notes, as the case may be; in no event shall such Registrable Notes be marked as
paid or otherwise satisfied.

          (t) Cooperate with each seller of Registrable Notes covered by any
Registration Statement and each underwriter, if any, participating in the
disposition of such Registrable Notes and their respective counsel in connection
with any filings required to be made with the NASD.

          (u) Use its best efforts to take all other steps reasonably necessary
to effect the registration of the Registrable Notes covered by a Registration
Statement contemplated hereby.

          The Issuers may require each seller of Registrable Notes as to which
any registration is being effected to furnish

<PAGE>
END

                                      -24-

to the Issuers such information regarding such seller and the distribution of
such Registrable Notes as the Issuers may, from time to time, reasonably
request. The Issuers may exclude from such registration the Registrable Notes of
any seller who fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after
receiving such request. Each seller as to which any Shelf Registration Statement
is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Issuers all information
required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished
to the Issuers by such seller not materially misleading.

          Each Holder of Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer
agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes to be sold by
such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Issuers of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 5(c)(ii), 5(c)(iv), 5(c)(v), or 5(c)(vi), such Holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Notes covered by such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Holder or
Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, and, in each case,
dissemination of such Prospectus until such Holder's or Participating
Broker-Dealer's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by Section 5(k), or until it is advised in writing (the "Advice")
by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto. In the event the
Issuers shall give any such notice, each of the Effectiveness Period and the
Applicable Period shall be extended by the number of days during such periods
from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the
date when each seller of Registrable Notes covered by such Registration
Statement or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Participating Broker-Dealer, as
the case may be, shall have received (x) the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) or (y) the Advice.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any
time or from time to time after the effective date of a Shelf Registration filed
pursuant to Section 2, the Company notifies in writing each Holder of
Registrable Notes to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration of the existence
of a Potential Material Event, the Holders shall not offer to sell any
Registrable Notes pursuant to the prospectus contained in such Shelf
Registration from the time of the giv-

<PAGE>

                                      -25-

ing of notice with respect to a Potential Material Event until the Holders
receive written notice from the Company that such Potential Material Event
either has been disclosed to the public or no longer constitutes a Potential
Material Event; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the effectiveness
of such Shelf Registration be suspended for a period of more than 60 consecutive
days (a "Suspended Period"), (ii) the Company may not declare Suspension Periods
more than two (2) times in any calendar year and (iii) in each such case the
Effectiveness Period of the Shelf Registration provided for in Section 2 shall
be extended by the number of days of the applicable Suspension Period pursuant
to the foregoing and Additional Interest shall not apply during the Suspension
Period to the extent that such Additional Interest is due solely as a result of
the imposition of the Suspension Period.

6.   Registration Expenses

          All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance
with this Agreement by the Issuers shall be borne by the Issuers whether or not
the Exchange Offer or a Shelf Registration is filed or becomes effective,

word processing and distributing all Registration Statements, underwriting

necessary in order to comply with this Agreement.

7.   Indemnification

          (a) Each of the Issuers jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Notes and each Participating
Broker-Dealer, the officers, directors, employees and agents of each such
Person, and each Person, if any, who controls any such Person within the meaning
of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(each, a "Participant"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages
and liabilities (including, without limitation, the reasonable legal fees and
other reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any suit, action
or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by, arising out of or based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Issuers
shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or caused by,
arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged

<PAGE>
END

                                      -27-

omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information relating to any Participant furnished to the Issuers in writing
by or on behalf of such Participant expressly for use therein; provided,
however, that the Issuers shall not be liable if such untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was contained or made in any
preliminary prospectus and corrected in the Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto and the Prospectus does not contain any other untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact
that was the subject matter of the related proceeding and any such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense suffered or incurred by the Participants
resulted from any action, claim or suit by any Person who purchased Registrable
Notes or Exchange Notes which are the subject thereof from such Participant and
it is established in the related proceeding that such Participant failed to
deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) to such
Person with or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Registrable Notes
or Exchange Notes sold to such Person if required by applicable law, unless such
failure to deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or
supplemented) was a result of noncompliance by the Issuers with Section 5 of
this Agreement.

          (b) Each Participant will be required to agree, severally and not
jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuer, its directors and officers
and each Person who controls each Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to each Participant, but only with
reference to information relating to such Participant furnished to the Issuers
in writing by such Participant expressly for use in any Registration Statement
or Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary
prospectus. The liability of any Participant under this paragraph shall in no
event exceed the proceeds received by such Participant from sales of Registrable
Notes or Exchange Notes giving rise to such obligations.

                                      -28-

          (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or
regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the
two preceding paragraphs, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly
notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying
Person") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the
Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the
Indemnifying Person may reasonably designate in such proceeding and shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses actually incurred by such counsel related to
such proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it of any obligation or liability which it
may have under Section 7 (a) or 7 (b) above except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person is unaware of the commencement of such action and such
omission results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Person of substantial
rights and defenses. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have
the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed in writing to the
contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the
named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and the Indemnified
Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Persons that are different
from or in addition to those available to any such Indemnifying Person. It is
understood that, unless there is a conflict among Indemnified Persons, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all
Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Participants and control
Persons of Participants shall be designated in writing by Participants who sold
a majority in interest of Registrable Notes sold by all such Participants and
any such separate firm for the Issuers, their respective directors, officers and
such control Persons of the Issuers

                                      -29-

shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not
be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final non-appealable
judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any
Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time
an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse
the Indemnified Person for reasonable fees and expenses actually incurred by
counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the
Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without its consent if (i) such settlement is entered into
more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid
request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the
Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such
settlement; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its consent pursuant to this sentence if the
Indemnifying Person is contesting, in good faith, the request for reimbursement.
No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person,
unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Person, in form and substance satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does
not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to
act by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person.

          (d) If the indemnification provided for in the first and second
paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold
harmless, an Indemnified Person in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such
paragraphs, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder and in
order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the

<PAGE>
END

                                      -30-

relative fault of the Indemnifying Person or Persons on the one hand and the
Indemnified Person or Persons on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions (or alleged statements or omissions) that resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand
or by the Participants or such other Indemnified Person, as the case may be, on
the other, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission and any other
equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances.

          (e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation
(even if the Participants were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims,
damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable
legal or other expenses actually incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall a
Participant be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which proceeds received by such Participant from sales of Registrable Notes or
Exchange Notes, as the case may be, exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Participant has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          (f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
Section 7 will be in addition to any liability which the Indemnifying Persons
may otherwise have to the Indemnified Persons referred to above.

8.   Rules 144 and 144A

          Each of the Issuers covenants that it will file the reports required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder in a timely manner and, if
at any time it is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request
of any Holder of Registrable Notes, make publicly available other information so
long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Each of the Issuers further covenants, for so long as any
Registrable Notes remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or
beneficial owner of Registrable Notes in connection with any sale thereof and
any prospective purchaser of such Registrable Notes from such Holder or
beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Registrable Notes pursuant to
Rule 144A.

9.   Underwritten Registrations

          If any of the Registrable Notes covered by any Shelf Registration are
to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment
bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected
by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable
Notes included in such offering and reasonably acceptable to the Issuers.

          No Holder of Registrable Notes may participate in any underwritten
registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's
Registrable Notes on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b)
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

10.  Miscellaneous

          (a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by any Issuer of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, each Holder of Registrable Notes and each
Participating Broker-Dealer holding Exchange Notes, in addition to being
entitled to exercise all rights provided herein, in the Indenture or, in the
case of an Initial Purchaser, in the Purchase Agreement, or granted by law,
including recovery of damages, will be entitled

<PAGE>
END

                                      -32-

to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each Issuer agrees
that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred
by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and
hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance
in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would
be adequate.

          (b) No Inconsistent Agreements. None of the Issuers has entered, as of
the date hereof, and none of the Issuers shall enter, after the date of this
Agreement, into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Notes in this
Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. None of the Issuers
has entered and none of the issuers shall enter into any agreement with respect
to any of its securities which will grant to any Person piggy-back rights with
respect to a Registration Statement.

          (c) Adjustments Affecting Registrable Notes. None of the Issuers
shall, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Registrable
Notes as a class that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders of
Registrable Notes to include such Registrable Notes in a registration undertaken
pursuant to this Agreement.

          (d) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from
the provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise than with the prior written
consent of (A) the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Registrable Notes and (B) in circumstances that
would adversely affect Participating Broker-Dealers, the Participating
Broker-Dealers holding not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Exchange Notes held by all Participating Broker-Dealers; provided, however,
that Section 7 and this Section 10(d) may not be amended, modified or
supplemented without the prior written consent of each Holder and each
Participating Broker-Dealer (including any person who was a Holder or
Participating Broker-Dealer of Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes, as the case
may be, disposed of pursuant to any Registration Statement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect
to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders of

<PAGE>
END

                                      -33-

Registrable Notes whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange
Offer or sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or
indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of
Registrable Notes may be given by Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Notes being tendered or being sold by such
Holders pursuant to such Registration Statement.

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

          (j) Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
