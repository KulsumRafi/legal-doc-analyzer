              (a) Terms of License. Pharmacia hereby grants to Insmed or
Insmed's designee(s) an exclusive (except as to Pharmacia's retained rights set
forth below), worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up license, with the right to
grant sublicenses, under the Proprietary Information to (i) seek and maintain
regulatory approvals in jurisdictions designated by Insmed from time to time for
the use of the Product in the treatment of Growth Hormone Insensitivity Syndrome
(including Laron Dwarfism), and (ii) develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer
for sale and import commercial products incorporating the Product for the
treatment of Growth Hormone Insensitivity Syndrome (including Laron Dwarfism).
Pharmacia hereby grants to Insmed an exclusive royalty bearing sublicense under
the [REDACTED] Rights and to the extent the Proprietary Information contains the
[REDACTED] Rights, the License shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
the [REDACTED] Agreement. The License is subject to Pharmacia's and its
Affiliates' nonexclusive license under the Proprietary Information to develop,
make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale or import any pharmaceutical product
or device; provided, however, Pharmacia and its Affiliates' may not grant
licenses or sublicenses to the Proprietary Information or the [REDACTED] Rights

              (b) Other Indications. If Insmed desires to use the Proprietary

after its receipt thereof; provided, Pharmacia may reject such Request for
Approval in its sole discretion. Pharmacia's response to a Request For Approval
may contain terms, including without limitation royalties, under which Pharmacia
may be willing to grant the licenses specified in such Request For Approval. If
Pharmacia does not deliver a written response to Insmed within such forty-five
(45) day period, Insmed shall deliver another copy of such Request For Approval
containing the information required in this Section 2(b) (the "Second Request")
and Pharmacia shall have fifteen (15) days to respond in writing to the Second
Request. If Pharmacia does not deliver a written response to the Second Request
within such fifteen (15) day period, it will be deemed to have given its
approval for the Other Indications described in the Request For Approval on the
same terms as the License. Pharmacia shall treat the information contained in a
Request For Approval and all supplementary information provided by Insmed in
response to a request from Pharmacia as strictly confidential, and will not make
any use of such information other than for the purpose of evaluating the Request
For Approval. Pharmacia shall limit access to the Request For Approval to those
of its employees and consultants who reasonably require access in order for
Pharmacia to evaluate the Request For Approval, and will be responsible for the
compliance by all such employees and consultants with Pharmacia's obligations
hereunder.

              (c) Costs. Insmed will be responsible for all costs and expenses
incurred by it in connection with its use of the Proprietary Information,
including without limitation its submission of the Proprietary Information as
part of its regulatory filings for the Product.

Insmed will have no responsibility for costs incurred by Pharmacia with respect
to the Proprietary Information prior to the date hereof.

              (d) [REDACTED] Agreement. To the extent the Proprietary
Information contains the [REDACTED] Rights, Insmed shall comply with the
[REDACTED] Agreement. However, Pharmacia understands that Insmed desires to
renegotiate the terms of the [REDACTED] Agreement, including without limitation
the royalties. Promptly after the Effective Date, Insmed shall contact
[REDACTED] and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a license under
the [REDACTED] Rights on terms acceptable to Insmed (the "Amended [REDACTED]
Agreement"). The Amended [REDACTED] Agreement shall provide that the [REDACTED]
Agreement has been terminated and Pharmacia shall have no further obligations to
[REDACTED]. Pharmacia shall reasonably cooperate with Insmed in connection with
the termination of the [REDACTED] Agreement. Insmed shall promptly provide a
copy of the Amended [REDACTED] Agreement to Pharmacia. In the event Insmed and
[REDACTED] do not execute the Amended [REDACTED] Agreement, Insmed shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to return the Proprietary Information to
Pharmacia and the terms of this Agreement relating to Insmed's rights under the
Proprietary Information shall terminate upon Insmed's written notice to
Pharmacia; provided, however, Insmed shall continue to be responsible for supply
of IGF-1 or SomatoKine in accordance with this Agreement.

              (e) [REDACTED] Agreement. [REDACTED] pursuant to the [REDACTED]
Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that after each party's review of the
[REDACTED] Agreement no rights to the Proprietary Information have been granted
to [REDACTED]. In order to induce Pharmacia to enter into this Agreement, Insmed
shall be fully responsible for any and all claims by or on behalf of [REDACTED]
arising out of the License.

         3.   Supply to Patients.

              (a) Supply Commitment. Insmed agrees that with respect to each
Patient, Insmed will supply each Patient's physician with Sufficient Quantities
of IGF-1 or SomatoKine as soon as practicable but not later than ninety (90)
days after receiving regulatory approval from the specific regulatory authority
to treat patients with the Product and continuing for a period of five years
from such date, or such earlier time as the Patient's physician determines to
discontinue the Patient's use of IGF-1 or SomatoKine. Product will be supplied
by Insmed in a timely manner as determined by Insmed in coordination with the
Patient's physician. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Insmed may provide
SomatoKine to the Patients' physicians in lieu of IGF-1 only in the event that
it is determined that SomatoKine is substantially equivalent to IGF-1 with
respect to safety and efficacy in the treatment of Growth Hormone Insensitivity
Syndrome (including Laron Dwarfism). [REDACTED]. Insmed shall bear the cost of
manufacturing and distributing the Product to the Patients' physicians for
administration to the Patients.

              (b) Compliance. Insmed will carry out its obligations under
Section 3(a) in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, including
without limitation cGMPs.

<PAGE>

              (c) Reporting. Insmed will provide Pharmacia with quarterly
written updates specifying the quantities of Product supplied to each Patient
and the timing of such deliveries, provided that Pharmacia is required to keep
all confidential medical information regarding Patients strictly confidential.

              (d) Supply Default. In the event Insmed fails to (or reasonably
anticipates that it will fail to) materially comply with its obligations under
Section 3(a), Insmed will deliver prompt written notice to Pharmacia, and if
Insmed is unable to cure such failure within ninety (90) days after delivery of
such notice, Pharmacia will have the right, in its sole discretion, to either
(i) terminate the License, (ii) require Insmed to enter into a supply
arrangement with Pharmacia under which Insmed would be required to supply
Sufficient Quantities of the Product for the Patients at Insmed's cost of
manufacture, or (iii) require Insmed to arrange for a third party to supply
Sufficient Quantities of the Product to the Patients' physicians in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. If Pharmacia elects to terminate the License,
Insmed must return all Proprietary Information (and all notes, documents and
other materials containing Proprietary Information) in its possession, to
Pharmacia, provided that Insmed's counsel may retain one copy of the Proprietary
Information to be used solely for the purpose of enabling Insmed to defend
itself in or pursue any litigation or other legal proceeding that may arise from
or relate to this Agreement or its use of the Proprietary Information. Insmed
acknowledges and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for
any breach of its obligations under Section 3(a) and that, in addition to any
and all other remedies available at law or in equity, Pharmacia will be entitled
to seek equitable relief, including injunctions and specific performance, as a
remedy for any refusal by Insmed to supply Product to the Patients' physicians
as contemplated herein.

         4.   Delivery of Proprietary Information. Upon the execution of this
Agreement, Pharmacia will endeavor to reasonably cooperate with Insmed in its
pursuit of regulatory approval for the Products and will deliver to Insmed
copies of the Proprietary Information in written and (where available)
machine-readable format. In addition, Pharmacia will promptly notify Insmed in
writing of any and all material developments affecting the Proprietary
Information and information which may be otherwise useful in obtaining
regulatory approvals for the Product that it or its Affilates develop, if any.
Such additional information will be treated as Proprietary Information for all
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Insmed agrees that Pharmacia's obligations to deliver the Proprietary
Information shall be limited to those documents and materials containing
Proprietary Information that are available to Pharmacia as of the date of this
Agreement, and Pharmacia or its Affiliates shall have no obligation to develop
any new data pertaining to the Proprietary Information. Pharmacia represents and
warrants that, to its knowledge, the Proprietary Information will, upon delivery
to Insmed, be true, accurate and complete with respect to the Proprietary
Information available to Pharmacia as of the date of this Agreement.

         5.   Intellectual Property Rights.

              (a) Ownership of Intellectual Property. As between Pharmacia and
Insmed, all clinical results and other data resulting from the application of

continuations-in-part, divisions, provisionals or any substitute applications,
any patent issued with respect to any such patent applications, any reissue,
reexamination, renewal or extension (including any supplementary protection
certificate) of any such patent, and any confirmation patent or registration
patent or patent of addition based on any such patent, and all foreign
counterparts of any of the foregoing owned or controlled by Pharmacia or its
Affiliates. However, Pharmacia represents and warrants that there are no
existing patents or patent applications owned or under the control of Pharmacia
or its Affiliates that would preclude Insmed from exercising its rights
hereunder.

              (b) Infringement Claims. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party in writing if it receives or becomes aware of any claim from any
third party that the use of the Proprietary Information by Insmed in the manner
contemplated herein infringes such third party's intellectual property rights.

authorized and that this Agreement is fully binding and enforceable on it in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable laws relating to creditors'
rights generally.

              (c) No Infringement. Pharmacia represents and warrants that, to

and hold harmless Pharmacia, its Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents from and against all Losses arising out of (i)
Insmed's failure to comply with its obligations or Insmed's negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations, (ii) any acts or
omissions of Insmed's sublicensees, (iii) any breach by Insmed of its

party providing such indemnification (the "Indemnitor") in writing promptly upon
becoming aware of any claim, threatened claim, damage, loss, suit, proceeding or
liability to which such indemnification may apply (a "Claim"). Failure to
provide such notice shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnitor's indemnity
obligations hereunder if, and only if, the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnitor shall assume and control the defense of the Claim at its
expense through counsel of its own choosing, such counsel to be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnitor so assumes the defense of

then the Indemnified Party may defend the Claim at the expense of the
Indemnitor. The Indemnitor may not settle any Claim (other than a settlement

other country, or any state, territory or political subdivision thereof or of
the District of Columbia, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions,
