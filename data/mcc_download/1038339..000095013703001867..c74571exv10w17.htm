Default, Lender may, upon five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior written notice to
Borrower, and with or without legal process, take possession of the Property
and Improvements, remove Borrower and all agents, employees and contractors of
Borrower from the Property and Improvements, complete the work of construction
and market for lease and lease space within the Property and/or Improvements.
For this purpose, Borrower irrevocably appoints Lender as its attorney-in-fact,
which agency is coupled with an interest. As attorney-in-fact, Lender may, in
Borrower&#146;s name, take or omit to take any action Lender may deem appropriate
with respect to third parties, including, without limitation, exercising
Borrower&#146;s rights under all contracts concerning the Property and/or
Improvements, but excluding the Loan Documents.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.5. Lender&#146;s Cessation of Construction. If Lender determines at any
time that the Improvements are not being constructed substantially in
accordance with the requirements under this Agreement, then upon the occurrence
of a Default therefor, Lender may, upon five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior written
notice to Borrower, immediately cause all construction to cease on any of the
Improvements affected by the condition of nonconformance. Borrower shall
thereafter not allow any construction work, other than corrective work, to be
performed on any of the Improvements affected by the condition of
nonconformance until such time as Lender notifies Borrower in writing that the
nonconforming condition has been corrected.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.6. Termination or Continuation of Development and Management
Agreements. Upon the occurrence of a Default wherein Lender elects to
accelerate the Loan and records a notice of default to foreclose the lien of
the Deed of Trust, Lender may elect to require Borrower to terminate the
Development and Management Agreements (and Borrower shall immediately do so),
without any termination fee or penalty, provided that all fees and expenses
previously accrued thereunder up to the effective date of such termination are
paid in full; provided however, so long as the Development and Management
Agreements are not terminated, the respective party or parties performing
services thereunder shall be entitled to continue to receive all fees and
expenses owed such party or parties under the applicable Development and
Management Agreements. In the event that Borrower reinstates the Loan under
California law prior to the foreclosure of the lien of the Deed of Trust, such
Development and Management Agreements shall be deemed to have been reinstated
as of the date of such reinstatement of the Loan.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.7. Repayment of Funds Advanced. Any funds expended by Lender in the
exercise of its rights or remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be payable to Lender upon demand, together with interest at the
rate applicable to the principal balance of the Note from the date the funds
were expended.

provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with those
granted by law or at equity, are cumulative and may be exercised by Lender at
any time. Lender&#146;s exercise of any right or remedy shall not constitute a cure
of any Default unless all sums then due and payable to Lender under the Loan
Documents are repaid and Borrower has cured all other Defaults. No waiver
shall be implied from any failure of Lender to take, or any delay by Lender in
taking, action concerning any Default or failure of condition under the Loan
Documents, or from any previous waiver of any similar or unrelated Default or
failure of condition. Any waiver or approval under any of the Loan Documents
must be in writing and shall be limited to its specific terms.
