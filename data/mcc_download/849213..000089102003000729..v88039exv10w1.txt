                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Available Cash" shall not take

            Person equal to the Company's percentage ownership interest in such
            Subsidiary or such other Person; provided, however, that the items
            under clauses (i)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) above shall
            only be included in Available Cash to the extent that the General
            Partner determines such amount to be legally available for dividends
            or distributions to the Company of a Subsidiary by such Subsidiary
            or such other Person; (ii) the amount of net income and the amount
            of depletion, depreciation, amortization and other noncash charges
            utilized in determining net income shall be determined, with respect
            to the Company, by the General Partner in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principals and, with respect to any Subsidiary
            or other Person in which the Company directly or indirectly holds an
            equity or other ownership interest, by its Board of Directors (or by
            such other body or person which has the ultimate management
            authority of such Subsidiary or such other Person) in accordance
            with generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) the net income
            of any Subsidiary or other Person in which the Company directly or
            indirectly holds an equity or other ownership interest shall be


                                       5
<PAGE>

            determined on an after-tax basis; (iv) the amount of any reductions
            in, or additions to, reserves for purposes of clauses (i)(c) and
            (ii)(d) above shall be determined, with respect to the Company, by
            the General Partner in its reasonable good faith judgment and, with
            respect to any Subsidiary or other Person in which the Company
            directly or indirectly holds an equity or other ownership interest,
            by its Board of Directors (or by such other body or person which has
            the ultimate management authority of such Subsidiary or such Person)
            in its reasonable good faith judgment; and (v) any determination of
            whether any capital expenditures or Investments are financed, or
            anticipated to be financed, with Cash from Capital Transactions for
            purposes of clause (ii)(b) or (ii)(f) above shall be made, with
            respect to the Company, by the General Partner in its reasonable
            good faith judgment and, with respect to any Subsidiary or other
            Person in which the Company directly or indirectly holds an equity
            or other ownership interest, by its Board of Directors (or by such
            other body or person which has the ultimate management authority of
            such Subsidiary or such Person) in its reasonable good faith
            judgment.

                  Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, any increase
            to Available Cash pursuant to clause (i)(g) above shall be made in
            the calendar quarter in which Qualified Debt is repaid in accordance
            with such clause (irrespective of the calendar quarter in which the
            Asset Sale occurred). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the item under
            clause (i)(g) above shall only be included in the calculation of
            Available Cash if (A) the Company has delivered to the
            Administrative Agent a Compliance Certificate in the form of Exhibit
            D for the calendar quarter in which the payment of Qualified Debt in
            accordance with clause (i)(g) above is made, and (B) the Pricing
            Leverage Ratio as the last day of such calendar quarter is less than
            4.0 to 1.0.

            (c) The definition of "Designated Acres" in Section 1.1 of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting such definition in its entirety
and inserting the following new definition of "Designated Acres" in replacement
thereof:

                  "Designated Acres" means up to an aggregate of 800,000 acres
            owned by the Company which (based on the good faith determination of
            the Responsible Representatives that such acres have at the time
            such determination is made a higher value as recreational,
            residential, grazing or agricultural property than for timber
            production) may be reasonably designated by the General Partner at
            the time of the sale thereof as constituting Designated Acres (such
            aggregate number of acres to be determined over the term of
            existence of the 2001 Senior Note Agreement).

            the Person making a sale of Property, net of: (a) the direct costs
            relating to such sale excluding amounts payable to the Company, any

            holds an equity or other ownership interest, (b) sale, use or other
            transaction taxes paid or payable as a result thereof, and (c)
            amounts required to be applied to repay principal, interest and

            (e) The definition of "Qualified Debt" in Section 1.1 of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended by deleting such definition in its entirety and
inserting the following new definition of "Qualified Debt" in replacement
thereof:

                  "Qualified Debt" means, as to the Company, as of any date of
            determination, without duplication, all outstanding indebtedness of
            the Company for borrowed money, including Indebtedness represented

            a sale of Properties permitted by subsection 8.2(i), then no less
            than 50% of the Net Proceeds of such sale shall either be paid by
            the Company as a prepayment of the Qualified Debt in accordance with
            the immediately following sentence or be reinvested in accordance
            with subsection 8.2(i). Prepayments under this subsection 2.7(a)(i)

            Notes such that there shall be applied to the 1989 Notes (until the
            1989 Notes are repaid in full) an amount equal to the total amount
            of the prepayment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
            is the outstanding balance of principal and interest on the 1989
            Notes immediately preceding the prepayment, and the denominator of
            which is the total amount of Indebtedness of the Company

            Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable
            grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
            otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
            fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
            Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
            statute, rule, regulation and treaty. Furthermore, while any Event
            of Default exists, the Company shall pay interest on the principal
            amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating
            interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to
            the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, statute, rule,
            regulation and treaty. "Default Rate" means an interest rate equal
            to (a) the Base Rate plus (b) the Applicable Margin applicable to
            Base Rate Loans plus (c) 2% per annum; provided, however, that with
            respect to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Default Rate shall be an
            interest rate equal to the interest rate (including any Applicable
            Margin) otherwise applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan plus 2%
            per annum, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by
            applicable law, statute, rule, regulation and treaty.
