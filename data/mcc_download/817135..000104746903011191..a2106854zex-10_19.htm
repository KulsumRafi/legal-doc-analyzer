<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary," with respect to any entity, shall mean any corporation (or other entity) in an unbroken chain of entities beginning
with such corporation (or entity) if each of the entities, or group of commonly controlled entities, other than the last entity in the unbroken chain, then owns stock (or other equity interest)
possessing 50% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of equity in one of the other entities in such chain; "Affiliate" shall mean, with respect to any Person, a Person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such Person, and with respect to the Company, also any entity designated by the Board of Directors of the Company in which the

and "control" shall have the meaning given such term under Rule&nbsp;405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has agreed to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase 43,643 shares of Common Stock (the "Purchase Stock") at a price per share of $5.27. The purchase of
the Purchase Stock will be made on January&nbsp;2, 2003 (the "Purchase Date"), unless the Company shall notify the Purchaser that the Purchase Date has been extended, in which case the Purchase Date

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the Purchase Date the Purchaser hereby subscribes for and shall purchase, and the Company will sell to the Purchaser, the Purchase Stock at a purchase price of $5.27
per share (the "Price Per Share") subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. The Company shall have no obligation to sell any Purchase Stock to any person who (i)&nbsp;is a resident

regulations in effect thereunder (the "Securities Act") or (ii)&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;counsel for the Purchaser (which counsel shall be acceptable to the Company) shall have furnished the Company with an
opinion, satisfactory in form and substance to the Company, that no such registration is required because of the availability of an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act and (B)&nbsp;if the Purchaser is a citizen or resident of any country other than the United States, or the Purchaser desires to effect any
Transfer in any such country, counsel for the Purchaser (which counsel shall be acceptable to the Company) shall have furnished the Company with an opinion or other advice satisfactory in form and

it is expressly understood that any such transferee shall be bound by the provisions of the Stockholder's Agreement and (z)&nbsp;a Transfer made after the Purchase Date in compliance with the
federal securities laws to a trust or custodianship the beneficiaries of which may include only the Purchaser, his spouse or his lineal descendants (which term shall include adoptive as well as
biological descendants) (the "Purchaser's Trust") or a Transfer made after the third anniversary of the Purchase Date to such a trust by a person who has become a holder of Stock in accordance with
