<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In consideration of the obligations of the Company and

the consideration to be received by the Company pursuant to the Employment

Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;) between the

Company and the Executive, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:</font></p>



<h1 style="font-weight:normal;margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Section 1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Secrecy, Non&#150;Competition, No

Interference and Non-Solicitation</u>.</font></h1>

agreements and covenants contained in this Section&nbsp;1 are essential to

protect the value of the Company&#146;s business and assets and (ii)&nbsp;by virtue

of his employment with the Company, the Executive will obtain such knowledge,

know-how, training and experience of such a character that there is a

substantial probability that such knowledge, know-how, training and experience

could be used to the substantial advantage of a competitor of the Company and

to the Company&#146;s substantial detriment.&#160;

Therefore, the Executive agrees that, for the period (the &#147;Restricted

Period&#148;) commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the date that

is one year after the termination of the Executive&#146;s employment under the

Employment Agreement for any reason, the Executive shall not participate,

operate, manage, consult, join, control or engage, directly or indirectly, for

himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, partnership,

corporation or other entity, whether as an employee, consultant, agent,

officer, stockholder, member, investor, agent or otherwise, in any business

activity if such activity constitutes the sale or provision of floral products

or services that are similar to, or competitive with, floral products or

services then being sold or provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries

or affiliated companies, including, without limitation, retail florists&#146;

business services, floral order transmission and related network services,

development and distribution of branded floral products on the Internet or

limitation, Interflora, Inc., Teleflora Inc., 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., PC

Illinois; the District of Columbia or any other state, territory, district or

commonwealth of the United States or any county, parish, city or similar

political subdivision in any other state, territory, district or commonwealth

of the United States; any other country or territory anywhere in the world or

in any city, canton, county, district, parish, province or any other political

subdivision in any such country or territory; or anywhere in the world (each

city, canton, commonwealth, county, district, parish, province, state, country,

territory or other political subdivision or other location in the world shall

be referred to as a &#147;Non-competition Area&#148;).&#160;

The parties to this Agreement intend that the covenant contained in the

preceding sentence of this Section 1(a) shall be construed as a series of

separate covenants, one for each city, canton, commonwealth, county, district,

parish, state, province, country, territory, or other political subdivision or

other area of the world</font></h2>

Except for geographic coverage, each separate covenant shall be

considered identical in terms to the covenant contained in the preceding

sentence.&#160; The parties further

acknowledge the breadth of the covenants, but agree that such broad covenants

are necessary and appropriate in the light of the global nature of the

Competitive Activity.&#160; If, in any

judicial or other proceeding, a court or other body declines to enforce any of

the separate covenants included in this Section 1(a), the unenforceable

covenant shall be considered eliminated from these provisions for the purpose

of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate

covenants to be enforced.&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may maintain or undertake

purely passive investments on behalf of himself, his immediate family or any

trust on behalf of himself or his immediate family in companies engaged in a

Competitive Activity so long as the aggregate interest represented by such

investments does not exceed 1% of any class of the outstanding publicly traded

debt or equity securities of any company engaged in a Competitive Activity.</font></h2>

the Restricted Period shall be tolled for the period in which the Executive is

in violation of such non-competition provisions.&#160; The Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may

limit the Executive&#146;s ability to earn a livelihood in a business engaged in a

Competitive Activity, but the Executive nevertheless believes that the

Executive has received and will receive sufficient consideration and other

benefits as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided under the

Employment Agreement to clearly justify restrictions that, in any event, given

his education, skills and ability, the Executive does not believe would prevent

the Executive from earning a living.</font></h1>

Company will or would suffer irreparable injury if the Executive were to

compete with the Company, FTDI or any of its or their subsidiaries or

affiliated companies in violation of this Agreement and that the Company would

by reason of such competition be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of

appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive further consents and stipulates to

the entry of such injunctive relief in such a court prohibiting the Executive

from competing with the Company or&#160; FTDI

or any of its or their subsidiaries or affiliated companies in violation of

this Agreement.</font></h1>

any, is partially or completely invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,

then that provision shall be ineffective in that jurisdiction to the extent of

its invalidity or unenforceability, but the invalidity or unenforceability of

that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other

provision of this Agreement, all of which shall be construed and enforced as if

that invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted, nor shall the invalidity

or unenforceability of that provision in one jurisdiction affect its validity

or enforceability in any other jurisdiction.&#160;

The Company and the Executive agree that the period of time and the

geographical area described in Section&nbsp;1 are reasonable in view of the

nature of the business in which the Company is engaged and proposes to be

engaged, and the Executive&#146;s understanding of his prospective future employment

opportunities.&#160; However, if the time

period or the geographical area, or both, described in Section&nbsp;1 should be

judged unreasonable in any judicial proceeding, then the period of time shall

be reduced by that number of months and the geographical area shall be reduced

by elimination of that portion, or both, as are deemed unreasonable, so that

the restriction covenant of Section&nbsp;1 may be enforced during the longest

period of time and in the fullest geographical area as is adjudged to be

reasonable.</font></h2>
