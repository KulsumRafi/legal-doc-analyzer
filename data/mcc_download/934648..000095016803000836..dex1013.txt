          Determination of the appropriate Applicable Percentages shall be made
          as of each Calculation Date. The Consolidated Total Debt Ratio in

          Letter of Credit Fee and the Commitment Fee that shall be effective as
          of the date designated by the Administrative Agent as the Applicable
          Percentage Change Date. The Administrative Agent shall determine the
          Applicable Percentages as of each Calculation Date and shall promptly
          notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the Applicable Percentages so
          determined and of the Applicable Percentage Change Date. Such
          determinations by the Administrative Agent of the Applicable
          Percentages shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The initial
          Applicable Percentage[s] shall be based on Pricing Level I until the
          first Applicable Percentage Change Date occurring after September 12,
          2002."

          (b) The definition of "Consolidated Capital Charges Coverage Ratio" is
     amended to read as follows:

               " "Consolidated Capital Charges Coverage Ratio" means, as of any
          Calculation Date, the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBIT for the
          four-quarter period ended as of such Calculation Date, to (ii)
          Consolidated Interest Expense plus dividends paid on preferred and/or
          common stock and/or stock repurchases paid for the four-quarter period
          ended as of such Calculation Date."

          (c) Section 1.3 is amended to read as follows:

               "1.3 Accounting Terms.

               Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all accounting
          terms used herein shall be interpreted, and all financial statements
          and certificates and reports as to financial matters required to be
          delivered to the Lenders hereunder shall be prepared, in accordance
          with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. All calculations made for the
          purposes of determining compliance with this Credit Agreement shall
          (except as otherwise expressly provided herein) be made by application
          of GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the most recent annual or
          quarterly financial

<PAGE>

          statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof (or, prior to the
          delivery of the first financial statements pursuant to Section 7.1
          hereof, consistent with the financial statements as at December 31,
          1998); provided, however, if (a) Speedway Motorsports shall object in
          writing to determining such compliance on such basis at the time of
          delivery of such financial statements due to any change in GAAP or the
          rules promulgated with respect thereto or (b) the Administrative Agent
          or the Required Lenders shall so object in writing within 30 days
          after delivery of such financial statements, then such calculations
          shall be made on a basis consistent with the most recent financial
          statements delivered by Speedway Motorsports to the Lenders as to
          which no such objection shall have been made.

               Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, determination of
          (i) the applicable pricing level under the definition of "Applicable
          Percentage" and (ii) compliance with the financial covenants hereunder
          shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis."

          (d) Section 7.11(b) is amended to read as follows:

               "(b) Consolidated Total Debt Ratio. The Consolidated Total Debt
          Ratio at each Calculation Date shall be no greater than (i) 3.25 to
          1.0 on September 30, 2002, December 31, 2002, March 31, 2003; and (ii)
          3.0 to 1.0 on June 30, 2003 and on each Calculation Date thereafter."

               "8.6 Restricted Payments.

                    None of the Credit Parties will directly or indirectly
               declare, order, make or set apart any sum for or pay any
               Restricted Payment, except (i) to make dividends payable solely
               in the same class of Capital Stock of such Person, (ii) to make
               dividends payable to any Credit Party, (iii) Speedway Motorsports
               may make dividends payable on its preferred and/or common stock
               and/or make stock repurchases of up to $15,000,000.00 in the
               aggregate annually provided no Default or Event of Default then
               exists or would be caused thereby, and (iv) as permitted by
               Section 8.7."
