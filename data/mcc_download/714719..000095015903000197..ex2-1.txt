     immediately prior to the Effective Time (consisting of shares issued or to

<PAGE>



2.4      Shareholder Rights; Stock Transfers
         -----------------------------------

     At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be

2.5      Fractional Shares
         -----------------

     Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Holding
Company Common Stock shall be issued to holders of Company Common Stock. In lieu
thereof, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to a fraction of
a share of Holding Company Common Stock shall, at the time of surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such holder's shares, receive an amount
of cash (without interest) equal to the amount determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the Final Purchase Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of fractional shares.










<PAGE>

2.6      Options
         -------

     (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is then outstanding,
whether or not exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a right to
purchase shares of Holding Company Common Stock, and the Holding Company shall
assume each Company Option, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Option Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is
evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) the Holding
Company and either its Board of Directors or a committee consisting solely of
two or more Non-Employee Directors, as defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the
Exchange Act, shall be substituted for the Company and the committee of the
Company's Board of Directors (including, if applicable, the entire Board of
Directors of the Company) administering such Company Option Plan, (ii) the
number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Holding Company Common
Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded up or down, as the
case may be, to the nearest whole share, and (iii) the per share exercise price
under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share
exercise price under each such Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided
that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.
Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence, each Company
Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by
Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not
to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. The Holding Company and the Company shall
take all necessary steps to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.6(a).

     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Holding Company
shall deliver to each participant in each Company Option Plan an appropriate
notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto and the grants
subject to such Company Option Plan shall continue in effect on the same terms
and conditions, including without limitation the duration thereof, subject to
the adjustments required by Section 2.6(a) hereof after giving effect to the
Merger. Within 30 days after the Effective Time, the Holding Company shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Options and shall maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain outstanding.







<PAGE>

2.7      Exchange Procedures
         -------------------

     (a) The Holding Company shall designate an exchange agent, reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes
of conducting the exchange procedure as described herein. No later than seven
business days following the Effective Time, the Holding Company shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or make available to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a notice
and letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected
and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares
of Company Common Stock shall pass only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the effectiveness of
the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in exchange
for the consideration set forth in Section 2.3 hereof deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

     (b) At the Effective Time, the Holding Company shall issue to the Exchange
Agent the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock issuable in the
Merger, which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for the holders of
Company Common Stock, as well as an amount of cash sufficient to fund any
amounts to be distributed pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof. The Exchange Agent
shall promptly distribute Holding Company Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof) as provided herein. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership
with respect to the shares of Holding Company Common Stock held by it from time
to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of
the persons entitled thereto.

     (c) Each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which prior
thereto represented shares of Company Common Stock who surrenders such
certificate or certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof
by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing
the number of full shares of Holding Company Common Stock into which the
aggregate number of shares of company Common Stock previously represented by
such certificate or certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement and any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to
Holding Company Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case without
interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each
outstanding certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein
provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent be deemed to evidence
ownership of the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock into which the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such certificate shall have been converted pursuant to



<PAGE>

the terms of this Agreement. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock and if such certificates are presented to the Company for
transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of certificates for Holding
Company Common Stock and cash as hereinabove provided. No dividends which have
been declared will be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of
Holding Company Common Stock under this Section 2.7 until such person surrenders
the certificate or certificates representing Company Common Stock, at which time
such dividends shall be remitted to such person, without interest.

     (d) The Holding Company shall not be obligated to deliver a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Holding Company Common Stock to which a
holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the
Merger until such holder surrenders the certificate or certificates representing
the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.7,
or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement
and/or a bond as may be required in each case by the Holding Company. If any
certificates evidencing shares of Holding Company Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that in which the certificate evidencing Company Common
Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Holding
Company Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

     (e) Any portion of the shares of Holding Company Common Stock delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the Holding Company pursuant to Section 2.7(b) that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to the Holding Company.
Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with Section
2.7(c) shall thereafter look only to the Holding Company for the consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If
outstanding certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered
or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of
Holding Company Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the
property of the Holding Company (and to the extent not in its possession shall
be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock
represented by any certificate for any consideration paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. The Holding
Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those



<PAGE>

persons entitled to receive consideration specified in this Agreement, which
books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of stock represented by any certificate, the Holding
Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration
represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be
relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

2.8      Additional Actions
         ------------------

     If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
consider that any further assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are
necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by
the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or
(ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Company and its
proper officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to do all acts necessary or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement; and the proper officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

benefit plan or agreement maintained for the benefit of employees or former

whether written or oral.





<PAGE>

     (b) None of Keystone, any of its Subsidiaries, any Keystone Employee Plan
constituting an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA ("Keystone Pension Plan") or to the best of Keystone's knowledge,
any fiduciary of a Keystone Pension Plan has incurred any material liability to
the PBGC or the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any such Keystone
Pension Plan. To the best of Keystone's knowledge, no reportable event under
Section 4043(b) of ERISA has occurred with respect to any Keystone Pension Plan.

     (c) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither Keystone nor any of its
Subsidiaries participate in and have not incurred any liability under Section
4201 of ERISA for a complete or partial withdrawal from a multi-employer plan
(as such term is defined in ERISA).

     (d) A favorable determination letter has been issued by the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each Keystone Pension Plan which is intended to
qualify under Section 401 of the Code to the effect that the Keystone Pension
Plan is qualified under Section 401 of the Code and the trust associated with
such Keystone Pension Plan is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code. No such
letter has been revoked or, to the best of Keystone's knowledge, is threatened
to be revoked and Keystone does not know of any ground on which such revocation
may be based. Neither Keystone nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liability
under any such Keystone Pension Plan that is not reflected on the statement of
condition of Keystone at December 31, 2001 or the notes thereto included in the
Keystone Financial Statements, other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business in connection therewith subsequent to the date thereof.

     (e) To the best of Keystone's knowledge, no prohibited transaction (which
shall mean any transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan which would result in the imposition, directly or
indirectly, of a material excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code or otherwise
have a Material Adverse Effect on Keystone.

     (f) Except as Previously Disclosed, full payment has been made (or proper
accruals have been established) of all contributions which are required for
periods prior to the date hereof, and full payment will be so made (or proper
accruals will be so established) of all contributions which are required for
periods after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, under the terms
of each Keystone Employee Plan or ERISA; no accumulated funding deficiency (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived, exists with respect to any Keystone Pension Plan, and there is no
"unfunded current liability" (as defined in Section 412 of the Code) with
respect to any Keystone Pension Plan. Keystone has not incurred and does not
expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan
under Subtitle of Title IV of ERISA.

     (g) To the best of Keystone's knowledge, the Keystone Employee Plans have
been operated in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the

thereunder and all other applicable governmental laws and regulations.

is obligated to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of Keystone

          quarter but prior to the normal dividend payment date for such
          calendar quarter, a pro rata cash dividend based on the Company's

          not to be satisfied;



<PAGE>


               (xvi) materially increase or decrease the rate of interest paid

     (b) Each of the Company and Keystone shall promptly notify the other Party
in writing of the occurrence of any matter or event known to and directly
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any changes in conditions
that affect the banking or savings institution industry generally, that would
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it.

5.7      Certain Actions
         ---------------

     (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
each such Subsidiary's directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and each such Subsidiary's
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Board of Directors
of the Company from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal
or state law; (B) providing information in response to a request therefor by a
Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Board of Directors of the Company receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement the terms of which are
substantially identical to those of the confidentiality agreement entered into
by the Company and Keystone dated December 31, 2002; (C) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal or (D) recommending such an Acquisition
Proposal to the shareholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that, in
each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, (i) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that such action would be required in order for its directors to comply with
their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and would,
if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from




<PAGE>

a financial point of view than the Merger. An Acquisition Proposal which is
received and considered by the Company in compliance with this Section 5.7 and
which meets the requirements set forth in clause (D) of the preceding sentence
is herein referred to as a "Superior Proposal." The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will notify Keystone
immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
representatives.

     (b) In the event that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and upon advice from
outside counsel, that it has received a Superior Proposal, it shall notify
Keystone in writing of its intent to terminate this Agreement and concurrently
with or after such termination cause the Company to enter into an acquisition
agreement with respect to, or recommend acceptance of, the Superior Proposal.
Such notice shall specify all of the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identify the Person making such Superior Proposal. Keystone shall
have five business days to evaluate and respond to the Company's notice. If
Keystone notifies the Company in writing prior to the expiration of the five
business day period provided above that it shall increase the Merger
Consideration to an amount at least equal to that of such Superior Proposal (the
"Keystone Proposal"), then the Company shall not be permitted to enter into an
acquisition agreement with respect to, or permit its Board to recommend
acceptance to its shareholders of, such Superior Proposal. Such notice by
Keystone shall specify the new Merger Consideration. The Company shall have five
business days to evaluate the Keystone Proposal.

     (c) In the event the Superior Proposal involves consideration to the
Company's shareholders consisting of securities, in whole or in part, a Keystone
Proposal shall be deemed to be at least equal to the Superior Proposal, if the
Keystone Proposal offers Merger Consideration that equals or exceeds the
consideration being offered to the Company's shareholders in the Superior
Proposal valuing any securities forming a part of the Superior Proposal at its
cash equivalent based upon (a) the average trading price of such securities for
the 20 trading days immediately preceding the date of the Keystone Proposal or
(b) the written valuation of such securities by a nationally recognized
investment banking firm selected if such securities are not traded on a
nationally recognized exchange or will be newly issued securities that are not
of a class then trading on a nationally recognized exchange. Any written
valuation shall be attached as an exhibit to the Keystone Proposal.

     (d) In the event that the Board of the Company determines in good faith,
upon the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel, that the Keystone
Proposal is not at least equal to the Superior Proposal, the Company can
terminate this Agreement in order to execute an acquisition agreement with
respect to, or to allow its Board to adopt a resolution recommending acceptance
to the Company's shareholders of, the Superior Proposal as provided in Section
7.1(h).

5.8      Current Information
         -------------------

     During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of Keystone and the Company shall, upon the request of the other party,
cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a monthly or
more frequent basis with representatives of the other party regarding its
financial condition, operations and business and matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. As soon as reasonably
available, but in no event more than 45 days after the end of each calendar
quarter ending after the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to
Keystone its quarterly report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, and, as soon
as reasonably available, but in no event more than 90 days after December 31,
2002, the Company will deliver to Keystone its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2002. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than 90 days after
December 31, 2002, Keystone will deliver to the Company audited statements of
condition (including related notes and schedules, if any) of Keystone as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and statements of income, changes in retained income
and cash flows (including related notes and schedules, if any) of Keystone for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. Keystone
also will deliver to the Company each Call Report report filed by Keystone with
the FDIC concurrently with the filing of such call report. Within 25 days after
the end of each month, the Company and Keystone will deliver to the other party
an unaudited consolidated statement of condition and an unaudited consolidated
statement of income, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.









<PAGE>

5.9      Indemnification; Insurance
         --------------------------

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Holding Company (the
"Indemnifying Party") shall provide indemnification to any present or former
director, officer or employee of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, in
each case determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), with
respect to any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, if first asserted or claimed prior
to the date hereof and Previously Disclosed, if first asserted or claimed
between the date hereof and the Effective Time and disclosed pursuant to Section
5.16 hereof or if first asserted or claimed after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent, if any, that such Indemnified Party would have been entitled to
indemnification by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under the Articles of
Incorporation, Articles of Association or Bylaws of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as Previously Disclosed, provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim, and provided, further,
that nothing contained herein shall extend or be deemed a waiver of any
applicable statute of limitations in respect of any claim or claim for
indemnification. Without limiting the foregoing, all limitations of liability
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties in the Articles of Incorporation,
Articles of Association or Bylaws of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect.

     (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.9(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements
therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless
the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest) in accordance with the obligations set forth in
Section 5.9(a) hereof, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall
not be




<PAGE>

unreasonably withheld, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation
hereunder in the event a federal banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

     (c) The Holding Company shall maintain the Company's existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy (or purchase an insurance policy
providing coverage on substantially the same terms and conditions) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time by persons who are currently
covered by such insurance policy maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for a period of six years following the Effective Time, provided,
however, that in no event shall the Holding Company be required to expend on an
annual basis more than 150% of the amount paid by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such insurance coverage (the "Insurance
Amount") to maintain or procure such insurance coverage, and further provided
that if the Holding Company is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for hereby, the Holding Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain as
much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. At the
request of the Holding Company, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
procure the insurance coverage referred to in the preceding sentence prior to
the Effective Time.

     (d) In the event that the Holding Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case the successors
and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director and officer covered
hereby and the heirs and estates thereof.

5.10     Directors and Executive Officers
         --------------------------------

     (a) On or prior to the Effective Time, each of Keystone and the Holding
Company agrees to take all action necessary to increase the size of their
respective Boards of Directors to 15 members, nine of whom shall be selected by
Keystone directors and six of whom shall be selected by the Company.
Furthermore, each of Keystone and the Holding Company shall take all action to

</TABLE>

     (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, each of Keystone and the Holding
Company agrees to take all action necessary to elect Jeffrey P. Feather as
Chairman of the Board, Scott V. Fainor as the President and Chief Executive
Officer and Eugene T. Sobol as the Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer of Keystone and the Holding Company.

5.11     Employees and Employee Benefit Plans
         ------------------------------------

     (a) All employees of the Company, the Bank or any other Company Subsidiary
as of the Effective Time (collectively, "Company Employees") shall become
employees of the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time, provided that, other than as provided by Section 5.11(g) hereof,
the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary shall have no obligation to
continue the employment of any such person and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any employee of the Holding Company or a Holding Company
Subsidiary a right to continuing employment with the Holding Company or a
Holding Company Subsidiary after the Effective Time. To the extent that the
Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary terminates the employment of any
Company, Bank or Keystone Employee (other than those employees, if any, who
receive payments pursuant to Section 5.11(d) hereof), other than for cause,
within six months following the Effective Time, the Holding Company shall, or
shall cause a Holding Company Subsidiary to, provide severance benefits in a
cash amount as mutually agreed to by Keystone and the Company, provided, however
that in no event shall the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary have
any obligation to provide severance benefits to any Company Employee whose
termination of employment occurs due to resignation or discharge for cause or
who is entitled to severance benefits or the equivalent thereof under the terms
of an individual contract with the Company or the Bank.





<PAGE>


     (b) With the exception of those individuals who are expected to enter into
new employment agreements pursuant to Section 5.11(g) hereof, each Company
Employee who remains employed by the Holding Company or a Holding Company
Subsidiary following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall be
entitled to participate in (i) such of the employee benefit plans, deferred
compensation arrangements, bonus or incentive plans and other compensation and
benefit plans that the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary may
continue for the benefit of Continuing Employees following the Effective Time
and (ii) whatever employee benefit plans and other compensation and benefit
plans (other than any stock option or restricted stock grant plan implemented by
the Holding Company) that the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary
may maintain for the benefit of its similarly situated employees on an equitably
equivalent basis, if such Continuing Employee is not otherwise then
participating in a similar plan described in Section 5.11(c) hereof. The parties
hereto acknowledge that Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in
the stock option plan implemented by the Holding Company within one year
subsequent to the Effective Time ("New Option Plan") (subject to receipt of
necessary corporate, regulatory and stockholder approval) based upon the same
criteria as other employees of Keystone or the Holding Company and the level of
grants shall give due regard to, among other factors, relative levels of title,
duties, salary and other compensation and benefits.

     (c) (i) At the Effective Time, the Holding Company or a Holding Company
Subsidiary shall become the plan sponsor of each Company Employee Plan. The
Company agrees to take or cause to be taken such actions as the Holding Company
or a Holding Company Subsidiary may reasonably request to give effect to such
assumption. The Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary shall have the
right and power at any time following the Effective Time to amend or terminate
or cease benefit accruals under any Company Employee Plan or cause it to be
merged with or its assets and liabilities to be transferred to a similar plan
maintained by it.

         (ii) For purposes of its employee benefit plans, the Holding Company
and a Holding Company Subsidiary shall treat Continuing Employees as new
employees, but shall amend its plans to provide credit for purposes of vesting
and eligibility to participate (but not for benefit accrual), for each
Continuing Employee's service with the Company, the Bank and any other
Subsidiary of the Company to the extent that such service was recognized for
similar purposes under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Continuing Employees and their covered dependents will not be
deprived of any partial or complete coverage under any employee benefit plan of
the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary (which provides the type of
benefits similar to benefits under any Company Employee Plan) because of any
waiting period or pre-existing condition or previous medical treatments, except
to the extent that such pre-existing condition or previous medical treatments
were excluded from coverage under a Company Employee Plan, in which case this
Section 5.11(c)(ii) shall not require coverage for such pre-existing condition
or previous medical treatments to the same extent such coverage was excluded
under a Company Employee Plan. To





<PAGE>

the extent that the initial period of coverage for Continuing Employees under
any employee benefit plan of the Holding Company or a Holding Company Subsidiary
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
overlaps with the 12 months coverage period of an applicable Company Employee
Plan, Continuing Employees shall be given credit during the initial period of
coverage for any deductibles and coinsurance payments made by Continuing
Employees under any Company Employee Plan during any partial period.

     (d) At and following the Effective Time, Keystone shall honor, and the
Holding Company shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and
former employees of the Company and the Bank existing as of the Effective Time,
as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation or
"change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of the Company which are
Previously Disclosed. Keystone acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger
will constitute a "change-in-control" of the Company for purposes of any
employee benefit plans, agreements and arrangements of the Company and the Bank.

    (e) The ESOP shall be terminated effective as of the Effective Time. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but not prior to the publication
of financial results covering at least 30 days of combined operations after the
Merger), the trustees of the ESOP shall, if necessary, convert to cash a portion
of the Holding Company Common Stock received by the ESOP in the Merger with
respect to unallocated Company Common Stock in order to repay the entire
outstanding balances of the ESOP loans in accordance with ERISA, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code, the rules, regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any precedential rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"). As soon as practicable after the retirement of the ESOP loans (but not
later than 90 days after the publication of financial results covering at least
30 days of combined operations after the Merger), the trustees of the ESOP shall
allocate the remaining Holding Company Common Stock received by the ESOP in the
Merger with respect to unallocated shares of Company Common Stock to the
accounts of all ESOP participants (whether or not such participants are then
actively employed) and beneficiaries in proportion to the account balance of
such participants and beneficiaries as they existed as of the Effective Time
(and, if required, to the accounts of former participants or their
beneficiaries) as investment earnings of the ESOP except as restricted by
applicable law. The Company and/or Keystone and the Holding Company shall
exercise best efforts to implement procedures that will assure the full
allocation of the remaining suspense account to such participants or their
beneficiaries. Upon the election of any participant, his or her benefit that
constitutes an "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Section
402(f)(2)(A) of the Code) under the ESOP may (i) in the sole discretion of
Keystone and the Holding Company, be rolled over to any qualified Keystone or
Holding Company (or any Subsidiary thereof) benefit plan, other than an employee
stock ownership plan of the Holding Company or Keystone, or (ii) be rolled over
to any individual retirement account and, provided further, that any such
distribution shall not occur until receipt of a favorable termination ruling
from the IRS.





<PAGE>

     The foregoing actions relating to termination of the ESOP will be adopted
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and upon receiving (i) a
favorable determination letter from the IRS with regard to the continued
qualification of the ESOP after any required amendments necessary to implement
the actions thereof set forth above and (ii) the receipt of a favorable
termination letter as to the termination of the ESOP. The Company, the Bank, and
the Holding Company will cooperate in submitting appropriate requests for any
such determination and termination letters to the IRS and will use their best
efforts to seek the issuance of such letters as soon as practicable following
the date hereof. The Bank and the Holding Company will adopt such additional
amendments to the ESOP as may be reasonably required by the IRS as a condition
to granting such favorable determination and termination letters provided that
such amendments do not substantially change the terms outlined herein or would
result in a material adverse change in the business, operations, assets,
financial condition or prospects of the Company or the Bank or result in an
additional material liability to the Holding Company or Keystone.

6.1      Conditions Precedent - Keystone and the Company
         -----------------------------------------------

     The respective obligations of Keystone and the Company to effect the Merger
shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions at or prior to the
Effective Time.

         (a) All corporate action necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been duly and validly
taken by Keystone, the Holding Company, and the Company, including without
limitation approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the shareholders
of the Company.

         (b) All approvals and consents from any Governmental Entity the
approval or consent of which is required for the consummation of the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
received and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired; and Keystone, the Holding Company, the Company and the Bank shall have
procured all other approvals, consents and waivers of each person (other than
the Governmental Entities referred to above) whose approval, consent or waiver
is necessary to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and the failure of which to obtain would have the effects
set forth in the following proviso clause; provided, however, that no approval
or consent referred to in this Section 6.1(b) shall be deemed to have been
received if it shall include any condition or requirement that, individually or
in the




<PAGE>

aggregate, would so materially reduce the economic or business benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Keystone that had such condition
or requirement been known, Keystone, in its reasonable judgment, would not have
entered into this Agreement.

         (c) None of Keystone, the Holding Company, the Company or the Bank
shall be subject to any statute, rule, regulation, injunction or other order or
decree which shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any
governmental or judicial authority which prohibits, restricts or makes illegal
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

         (d) The Form S-1 shall have become effective under the Securities Act,
and Keystone shall have received all state securities laws or "blue sky" permits
and other authorizations or there shall be exemptions from registration
requirements necessary to issue the Holding Company Common Stock in connection
with the Merger, and neither the Form S-1 nor any such permit, authorization or
exemption shall be subject to a stop order or threatened stop order by the
Commission or any state securities authority.

         (e) The shares of Holding Company Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger and the Conversion shall have been approved for
listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market's National Market. In addition, Keystone and
the Holding Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the trading
symbol of the Holding Company Common Stock be "KNBT" or such other available
symbol mutually agreed to by the Parties and the Holding Company.

         (f) Each of Keystone and the Company shall have received the written
opinion of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to both the Company and Keystone, dated as of the
Effective Time, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent
with the state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger will be
treated for Federal income tax purposes as constituting a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If such legal counsel does not render
such opinion, this condition may be satisfied if Grant Thornton LLP, independent
auditors of Keystone and the Company, renders such opinion, relying on such
facts, representations and assumptions. In rendering such opinion, such counsel
or auditors may require and rely upon representations and covenants, including
those contained in certificates of officers of Keystone, the Company and others,
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

         (g) The Conversion shall have been consummated.

6.2      Conditions Precedent - The Company
         ----------------------------------

satisfaction of the following conditions at or prior to the Effective Time
unless waived by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof.

         (a) The representations and warranties of Keystone set forth in Article
IV hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date, or on the date when made in the case of a representation and
warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, except for the representations and warranties contained in
the first sentence of Section 4.13, any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Keystone shall not prevent the satisfaction of the condition
contained in this Section 6.2(a) unless the cumulative effect of all such
inaccuracies, taken in the aggregate, represent a Material Adverse Effect on
Keystone. In applying the preceding sentence, the determination of whether a
representation and warranty of Keystone is inaccurate shall be made without
regard to any language in Article IV which would otherwise qualify such
representation and warranty individually by reference to materiality or a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Keystone shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and complied with all covenants required to be performed and
complied with by it pursuant to this Agreement on or prior to the Effective
Time.

         (c) Keystone shall have delivered to the Company a certificate, dated
the date of the Closing and signed by its Chairman and by its Chief Financial
Officer, to the effect that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and
6.2(b) have been satisfied.

         (d) No proceeding initiated by any Governmental Entity seeking an
order, injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be pending.

         (e) Keystone shall have furnished the Company with such certificates of
its respective officers or others and such other documents to evidence
fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 as such
conditions relate to Keystone as the Company may reasonably request.

6.3      Conditions Precedent - Keystone
         -------------------------------

     The obligations of Keystone to effect the Merger shall be subject to
satisfaction of the following conditions at or prior to the Effective Time
unless waived by Keystone pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof.




<PAGE>

         (a) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of
the Closing Date, or on the date when made in the case of a representation and
warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, except for the representations and warranties contained in
the second and fourth sentences of Section 3.1 and the first sentence of Section
3.13, any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company
shall not prevent the satisfaction of the condition contained in this Section
6.3(a) unless the cumulative effect of all such inaccuracies, taken in the
aggregate, represent a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. In applying the
preceding sentence, the determination of whether a representation and warranty
of the Company is inaccurate shall be made without regard to any language in
Article III which would otherwise qualify such representation and warranty
individually by reference to materiality or a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and covenants required to be performed by it pursuant to this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time.

         (c) The Company shall have delivered to Keystone a certificate, dated
the date of the Closing and signed by its President and Chief Executive Officer
and by its Chief Financial Officer, to the effect that the conditions set forth
in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b) have been satisfied.

         (d) No proceeding initiated by any Governmental Entity seeking an
order, injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be pending.

         (e) The Company shall have furnished Keystone with such certificates of
its officers or others and such other documents to evidence fulfillment of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 as such conditions relate to the
Company as Keystone may reasonably request.

                        TERMINATION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT

7.1      Termination
         -----------

     This Agreement may be terminated:

     (a) at any time on or prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual consent in
writing of the parties hereto;




<PAGE>

     (b) at any time on or prior to the Effective Time, by Keystone in writing
if the Company has, or by the Company in writing if Keystone has, in any
material respect, breached (i) any material covenant or undertaking contained
herein or (ii) any representation or warranty contained herein, in any case if
such breach would have a Material Adverse Effect on the party and has not been
cured by the earlier of 30 days after the date on which written notice of such
breach is given to the party committing such breach or the Effective Time;

     (c) at any time, by either Keystone or the Company in writing, (i) if any
application for prior approval of a Governmental Entity which is necessary to
consummate the Merger, the Conversion or the other transactions contemplated
hereby is denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the
Governmental Entity which must grant such approval, unless within the 25-day
period following such denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an
amended application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity,
provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7(c)(i) if such denial or request or
recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein, or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, the Conversion or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

     (d) at any time, by either Keystone or the Company in writing, if (i) the
shareholders of the Company do not approve this Agreement after a vote taken
thereon at a meeting duly called for such purpose (or at any adjournment
thereof) or (ii) the depositors of Keystone do not approve the Conversion after
a vote taken thereon at a meeting duly called for such purpose (or at any
adjournment thereof), unless in either case the failure of such occurrence shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate to perform or observe in
any material respect its agreements set forth herein to be performed or observed
by such party at or before the Effective Time; and

     (e) by either Keystone or the Company in writing if the Effective Time has
not occurred by the close of business on March 31, 2004, of the date hereof,
provided that this right to terminate shall not be available to any party whose
failure to perform an obligation in breach of such party's obligations under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger
to be consummated by such date.

     (f) At any time prior to the Company Meeting, by Keystone if (i) the
Company shall have breached Section 5.7, (ii) the Company Board shall have
failed to make its recommendation referred to in Section 5.2(a), withdrawn such
recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a manner adverse in
any respect to the interests of Keystone or (iii) the Company shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 5.2(a) by failing to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section
5.2(a).





<PAGE>



     (g) By Keystone if a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Keystone
or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Company Board recommends that the shareholders
of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange
offer within the ten-Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act.

     (h) At any time prior to the Company Meeting, by the Company in order to
concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement or similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") with respect to a Superior Proposal which has been
received and considered by the Company and the Company Board in compliance with
Section 5.7 hereof, provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by
the Company pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) only after the fifth Business Day
following Keystone's receipt of written notice from the Company in accordance
with Section 5.7(b) advising Keystone that the Company is prepared to enter into
an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, and only if,
during such five-Business Day period, Keystone does not, in its sole discretion,
make an offer to the Company that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least equal to
the Superior Proposal.

     (i) At any time prior to the Depositor Meeting, by the Company if (i) the
Keystone Board shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to in
Section 5.2(b), withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such
recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of the
Company or (ii) Keystone shall have materially breached its obligations under
Section 5.2(b) by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Depositor Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(b).

     For purposes of this Section 7.1, termination by Keystone also shall be
deemed to be a termination on behalf of the Holding Company.

7.2      Effect of Termination
         ---------------------

     In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, except that (i) the
provisions relating to confidentiality set forth in Section 5.4(b) and expenses
and the termination fees set forth in Section 8.1, and this Section 7.2, shall
survive any such termination and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b),
(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) shall not relieve the breaching party from
liability for willful breach of any covenant, undertaking, representation or
warranty giving rise to such termination.




<PAGE>

7.3      Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants
         -----------------------------------------------------

     All representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall expire on, and be
terminated and extinguished at, the Effective Time other than covenants that by
their terms are to be performed after the Effective Time (including without
limitation the covenants set forth in Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 hereof),
provided that no such representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed
to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive Keystone or the Company (or
any director, officer or controlling person of either thereof) of any defense at
law or in equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any
person, including, without limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of
either Keystone or the Company.

7.4      Waiver
         ------

     Each party hereto by written instrument signed by an executive officer of
such party, may at any time (whether before or after approval of this Agreement
by the shareholders of the Company) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto and may waive (i) any
inaccuracies of the other party in the representations or warranties contained

to the extent permitted by law, satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent
to its obligations contained herein or (iv) the performance by the other party
of any of its obligations set forth herein, provided that any such waiver
granted, or any amendment or supplement pursuant to Section 7.5 hereof executed
after shareholders of the Company have approved this Agreement shall not modify
either the amount or form of the consideration to be provided hereby to the
holders of Company Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger or otherwise
materially adversely affect such shareholders without the approval of the
shareholders who would be so affected.

7.5      Amendment or Supplement
         -----------------------

     This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto, subject to the proviso to Section 7.4 hereof.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

8.1      Expenses; Termination Fees
         --------------------------

     (a) Each party hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by
it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel, provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Keystone nor the Company shall be released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

     (b) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by Keystone while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the parties
hereto agree that the Company shall pay to Keystone a termination fee of $4.0
million (the "Termination Fee") in the manner set forth below if:

               (i) this Agreement is terminated by Keystone pursuant to Section
          7.1(f) or (g);

               (ii) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Keystone pursuant to
          Section 7.1(b), (B) by either Keystone or the Company pursuant to
          Section 7.1(e), or (C) by either Keystone or the Company pursuant to
          Section 7.1(d)(i) (other than by reason of any breach by Keystone or
          the Company, respectively), and in the case of any termination
          pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) an Acquisition Proposal shall have
          been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the
          senior management of the Company or the Board of Directors of the
          Company (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or
          made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an
          Acquisition Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
          prior to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of the Company
          contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Meeting, in the case of
          clause (C), or the date of termination of this Agreement, in the case
          of clause (A) or (B); or

               (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
          Section 7.1(h).

     In the event the Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or (ii), (x) the Company shall pay to Keystone an amount equal to $1.5
million on the first Business Day following termination of this Agreement, and
(y) if within 24 months after such termination the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company enters into any agreement with respect to, or consummates, any
Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall pay to Keystone the Termination Fee
(net of any payment made pursuant to clause (x) above) on




<PAGE>

the date of execution of such agreement or consummation of the Acquisition
Transaction. In the event the Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(iii), the Company shall pay to Keystone the entire Termination
Fee within two Business Days following the date of termination of this
Agreement. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Keystone.

     (c) The Company and Keystone agree that the agreements contained in
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this Section 8.1 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement either
Party would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do not
constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by either Party. If either Party fails to pay the other Party hereto
the amounts due thereto under paragraphs (b) and (d) above, as the case may be,
within the time periods specified therein, such Party shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the other
Party in connection with any action in which the other Party prevails, including
the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together
with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate
prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid
until the date of actual payment.

     (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(c), 7.1(d)(ii) or 7.1(i), then Keystone shall pay to the Company,
within five business days of such termination, a termination fee of $1.0 million
plus the documented out-of pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to exceed $1.0 million
in the aggregate; provided, however, that Keystone shall not be required to pay
the termination fee or to reimburse the Company for such expenses if at the time
of such termination the Company had materially breached its representations,
warranties or covenants or if the failure to obtain such approvals, waivers or
authorizations of any Governmental Entity resulted as a consequence of facts or
circumstances relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

8.2      Entire Agreement
         ----------------

     This Agreement contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes all prior arrangements or
understandings with respect thereto, written or oral, other than documents
