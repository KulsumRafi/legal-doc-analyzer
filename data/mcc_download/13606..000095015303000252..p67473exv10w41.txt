"Security Documents" shall mean such documents as modified in the Modifications.

         D.       Unlimited Guaranties guaranteeing repayment of the Loan (the
"Guarantee Agreements") were executed and delivered to Lender by Electronic

Oregon corporation ("Panelview") (hereinafter EDI and Panelview together called
"Guarantors").

         E.       Administration of the Loan has been transferred by Lender from
Dallas, Texas to Phoenix, Arizona in the state where Borrower has its chief
executive office.

         F.       Borrower has requested that Lender modify the Loan and the
Loan Documents as provided herein. Lender is willing to so modify the Loan and
the Loan Documents, subject to the terms and conditions herein.

                                   AGREEMENT:

         For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, Borrower and Lender agree as follows:

SECTION 1.        ACCURACY OF RECITALS; ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

         1.1      Borrower acknowledges the accuracy of the Recitals.

SECTION 2.        MODIFICATION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS; OTHER AGREEMENTS.

         2.1      The Note is hereby amended as follows:

                  (a)      The definition of Adjusted LIBOR Rate in Section 1 of
         the Note is hereby amended to read as follows:

                           "Adjusted LIBOR Rate" shall mean with respect to each
                  Interest Period, on any day thereof an amount equal to the sum
                  of (i) one and one-half percent (1.50%), plus, (ii) the
                  quotient (rounded upward to the nearest 1/100 of one percent)
                  of (a) the LIBOR Rate with respect to such Interest Period,
                  divided by (b) the remainder of 1.0 less the Reserve
                  Requirement in effect on such day. Each determination by Bank
                  of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall, in the absence of manifest
                  error, be conclusive and binding.

         2.2      Each of the Loan Documents is modified to provide that it
shall be a default or an event of default thereunder if Borrower shall fail to
comply with any of the covenants of Borrower herein or if any representation or
warranty by Borrower herein or by any guarantor in any related Consent and
Agreement of Guarantors is materially incomplete, incorrect, or misleading as of
the date hereof.

         2.3      Each reference in the Loan Documents to any of the Loan
Documents is hereby amended to be a reference to such document as modified
herein.

SECTION 3.        RATIFICATION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS AND COLLATERAL.

         The Loan Documents are ratified and affirmed by Borrower and shall
remain in full force and effect as modified herein. Any property or rights to or
interests in property granted as security in the Loan Documents shall remain as
security for the Loan and the obligations of Borrower in the Loan Documents.
