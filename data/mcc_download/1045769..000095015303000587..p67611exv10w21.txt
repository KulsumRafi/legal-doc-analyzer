                                 FIRST AMENDMENT
                                       TO
                           LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

      THIS FIRST AMENDMENT (this "Amendment") is made this September 19, 2001 by
and between GOLDEN EAGLE LEASING, INC., an Arizona corporation ("Borrower"), and
WEBSTER BANK, a federally chartered savings bank ("Lender").

                                   Background

      A. Lender has extended a revolving credit loan in the maximum amount of
$10,000,000 (the "Loan") to Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan and
Security Agreement dated August 24, 2001 (the "Loan Agreement").

      B. The Revolving Credit Loan is evidenced by the revolving credit note
dated August 24, 2001 in the original principal amount of $10,000,000 (the

of a security interest in the Collateral, as such term is defined in the Loan
Agreement.

      C. The Loan has been guarantied by Hypercom Corporation, the Borrower's
parent corporation, pursuant to that certain guaranty dated as of August 24,
2001 (the "Guaranty" and together with the Loan Agreement, the Note, and all
other documents relating thereto, the "Loan Documents").

      D. Borrower has requested that Lender modify the terms of the Loan
Documents to provide for the release of Lender's security interest in certain
Collateral under certain circumstances.

      E. Lender has agreed to Borrower's request, subject to the terms and
conditions contained in this Amendment.

                                    Agreement

      In consideration of the Background, which is incorporated by this
reference, other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is acknowledged, and the mutual promises and covenants contained in this
Amendment, the parties, intending to be bound legally, agree as follows:

                  In the event of any dispute as to whether a Lease Receivable
                  is or has ceased to be an Eligible Lease Receivable, the
                  decision of the Lender shall control in its sole discretion.
                  Any Eligible Lease Receivable which the Lender subsequently
                  determines to be no longer eligible or acceptable hereunder at
                  any time shall nevertheless be and remain at all times part of
                  the Collateral except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5

                  month, Borrower may request the release of the Lender's
                  security interest in those Eligible Lease Receivables which no
                  longer meet the qualifications of an Eligible Lease Receivable
                  and are no longer listed in any Lease Certificate or Borrowing
                  Base Certificate upon which a Revolving Credit Advance has
                  been based (an "Ineligible Lease Receivable"). Upon receipt of
                  such request, and provided that (i) the then outstanding
                  balance of the Loan does not exceed the Borrowing
                  Availability, and (ii) no Defaults shall have occurred not
                  cured within the applicable cure period if any, or waived by
                  Lender, Lender shall agree to release its security interest in
                  such Ineligible Lease Receivable by notifying Custodian of its
                  approval of the Borrower's request. Any Ineligible Lease
                  Receivable for which release is requested, but not approved by
                  Lender shall remain part of the Collateral.
