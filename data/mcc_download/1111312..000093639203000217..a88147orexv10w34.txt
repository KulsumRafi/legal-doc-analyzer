documents, and the rights and remedies of MLBFS thereunder and all other matters
in connection therewith. The obligations of Customer under this paragraph shall
survive the expiration or termination of this Loan Agreement and the discharge
of the other Obligations.

(e) RIGHT TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS. If Customer shall fail to do any act or thing
which it has covenanted to do under this Loan Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents, or any representation or warranty on the part of Customer contained

and may expend its funds for such purpose. Any and all reasonable amounts so
expended by MLBFS shall be repayable to MLBFS by Customer upon demand, with
interest at the "Interest Rate" (as that item is defined in the Note) during the
period from and including the date funds are so expended by MLBFS to the date of
repayment, and all such amounts shall be additional Obligations. The payment or
performance by MLBFS of any of Customers obligations hereunder shall not relieve
Customer of said obligations or of the consequences of having failed to pay or
perform the same, and shall not waive or be deemed a cure of any Default.

(f) LATE CHARGE. Any payment required to be made by Customer pursuant to this
Loan Agreement or any of the Loan Documents not paid within ten (10) days of the
applicable due date shall be subject to a late charge in an amount equal to the
lesser of: (i) 5% of the overdue amount, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by
applicable law. Such late charge shall be payable on demand.

to execute and deliver to MLBFS such additional agreements, instruments and
documents as MLBFS may reasonably require or deem advisable to effectuate the
purposes of this Loan Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan Documents, or
to establish, perfect and maintain MLBPS' security interests and liens upon the
Collateral, including, but not limited to: (i) executing financing statements or
amendments thereto when and as reasonably requested by MLBFS; and (ii) if in the
reasonable judgment of MLBFS it is required by local law, causing the owners
and/or mortgagees of the real property on which any Collateral may be located to
execute and deliver to MLBFS waivers or subordinations reasonably satisfactory
to MLBFS with respect to any rights in such Collateral.

(h) BINDING EFFECT This Loan Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents
shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of MLBFS, Customer and
their respective successors and assigns. MLBFS reserves the right, at any time
while the Obligations remain outstanding, to sell, assign, syndicate or
otherwise transfer or dispose of any or all of MLBFS' rights and interests under
the Loan Documents. MLBPS also reserves the right at any time to pool the Loan
with one or more other loans originated by MLBFS or any other Person, and to
securitize or offer interests in such pool on whatever terms and conditions
MLBFS shall determine. Customer consents to MLBFS releasing financial and other
information regarding Credit Parties, the Collateral and the Loan in connection
with any such sale, pooling, securitization or other offering. Customer shall
not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Loan
Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan Documents without the prior written
consent of MLBFS. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in a writing signed by
MLBFS, no such consent shall in any event relieve Customer of any of its
obligations under this Loan Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan
Documents.

headings in this Loan Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience,

                                      NOTE

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, APPLIED MOLECULAR EVOLUTION, INC., a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware ("Customer") hereby
promises to pay to the order of MERRILL LYNCH BUSINESS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.,
a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware
("MLBFS"), in lawful money of the United States, the principal sum of Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or if more or less, the aggregate amount
advanced by MLBFS to Customer pursuant to the Loan Agreement (the "Loan
Amount"); together with interest on the unpaid balance of the Loan Amount, from
the Closing Date until payment in full, at the Interest Rate, as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS.

(a) In addition to terms defined elsewhere in this Note, as used herein, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

"Base Rate" shall mean a variable per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) 1.00%
per annum, and (ii) the interest rate from time to time published in the "Money
Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal as the one-month London Interbank
Offered Rate (the "One-Month LIBOR"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
if more than one rate is so published, then the interest rate shall be the
highest of such published rates. The Base Rate will change as of the date of
publication in The Wall Street Journal of a One-Month LIBOR that is different
from that published on the preceding Business Day. In the event that The Wall
Street Journal shall, for any reason, fail or cease to publish the One-Month
LIBOR, MLBFS will choose a reasonably comparable index or source to use as the
basis for the Interest Rate.

"Closing Date" shall mean the date of advancement of funds hereunder.

"Excess Interest" shall mean any amount or rate of interest (including the
Default Rate and, to the extent that they may be deemed to constitute interest,
any prepayment fees, late charges and other fees and charges) payable, charged
or received in connection with any of the Loan Documents which exceeds the
maximum amount or rate of interest permitted under applicable law.

"Interest Rate" shall mean the Base Rate, or in the event Customer meets the
LIBOR Rate Interest Option Conditions set forth herein, the LIBOR Rate during
the applicable LIBOR Interest Period.

"LIBOR Interest Period" shall mean, for each LIBOR Rate Interest Option, a
period commencing: (i) on the LIBOR Rate Effective Date of such LIBOR Rate
Interest Option, or (ii) on the last day of the immediately preceding LIBOR
Interest Period in the case of a rollover of a LIBOR Interest Period to another
LIBOR Interest Period, and in each case, ending on the numerically corresponding
day as the day of the LIBOR Rate Effective Date, but one, two, three, six or
twelve months thereafter, applicable depending on which LIBOR Rate Interest
Option the Customer shall elect in accordance with the terms herein; provided
(A) any LIBOR Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which is not a
Business Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless such
Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such LIBOR Interest
Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day; (B) any LIBOR Interest
Period which begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day
for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the
end of such LIBOR Interest Period) shall end on the last Business Day of the
appropriate calendar month; and (C) no LIBOR Interest Period shall ever extend
beyond the Maturity Date.

"LIBOR Rate" shall mean, with respect to each LIBOR Interest Period, a fixed
rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) 1.00% per annum and (ii) the London
Interbank Rate with respect to such LIBOR Interest Period.

"LIBOR Rate Effective Date" shall mean in the case of a LIBOR Rate Interest
Option, the date two (2) Business Days after the LIBOR Rate Set Date provided
the LIBOR Rate Interest Option Conditions shall have been met.

"LIBOR Rate Interest option" shall have the meaning in the definition of LIBOR
Interest Period.

"LIBOR Rate Set Date" shall mean in the case of a LIBOR Rate Interest Option,
the date two (2) Business Days preceding the first day of any proposed LIBOR
Interest Period.

"Loan Agreement" shall mean that certain TERM LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of the
date hereof between Customer and MLBFS, as the same may have been or may
hereafter be amended or supplemented.

"London Interbank Rate " shall mean the interest rate per annum at which
deposits in US Dollars are offered in London, England to prime banks in the
London Interbank market as displayed on Telerate Screen page 3750 as of
11:00 a.m. (London time) two (2) Business Days before the first day of such
LIBOR Interest Period for either the One-Month London Interbank Offered Rate
("Fixed One-Month LIBOR"), Two-Month London Interbank Offered Rate ("Fixed
Two-Month LIBOR"), Three-Month London Interbank Offered Rate ("Fixed Three-Month
LIBOR), Six-Month London Interbank Offered Rate ("Fixed Six-Month LIBOR") or
Twelve-Month London Interbank Offered Rate ("Fixed Twelve-Month LIBOR")
(collectively, and each individually as applicable, the "LIBOR Rate Interest
Option"). Telerate Screen page 3750 means the display designated as page 3750 on
the Dow Jones Telerate Service, If such rate does not appear on Telerate Screen
page 3750 on any relevant date for the determination of LIBOR, then the London
Interbank Rate shall mean the Base Rate.

<PAGE>

"Note" shall mean this NOTE.

"Maturity Date" shall mean the date eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date.

(b) Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning
set forth in the Loan Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the terms "Loan
Documents", "Bankruptcy Event" and "Event of Default" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement.

2. LIBOR RATE INTEREST OPTION AND CONDITIONS. The Customer shall have the right
to designate or convert the unpaid principal balance of the Note from a Base
Rate or a LIBOR Rate to a LIBOR Rate for the LIBOR Interest Period related to
the LIBOR Rate Interest Option in accordance with the LIBOR Rate Interest Option
Conditions. The "LIBOR Rate Interest Option Conditions" shall mean:

      (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under
the Loan Documents and no event has occurred which could result in a Default or
Event of Default under the Loan Documents;

      (ii) Customer shall give MLBFS notice by telephone, promptly confirmed by
written notice in a form similar to the LIBOR Rate Interest Option Request Form
("Request Form"), attached hereto as Exhibit A;

      (iii) the Request Form must be received in MLBFS' Chicago office, to the
attention of East Portfolio, no later than 1:00 pm central standard time (or
daylight savings time, if applicable) as of the LIBOR Rate Set Date; and

      (iv) the Request Form must designate (A) the facility number of the Note,
(B) date of request, (C) the LIBOR Rate Set Date, (D) the LIBOR Rate Effective
Date, (E) the applicable LIBOR Rate Interest Option (for which the LIBOR
Interest Period may not be after the Maturity Date), and (F) be properly
executed by Customer.

If the LIBOR Rate Interest Option Conditions are met, MLBFS will change the
Interest Rate applicable to the unpaid principal balance of the Note to the
LIBOR Rate for the LIBOR Interest Period applicable to the LIBOR Rate Interest
Option designated by Customer in the Request Form. If any of the LIBOR Rate
Interest Option Conditions are not met, the Interest Rate on the unpaid
principal balance of the Note will remain the Base Rate, if the Base Rate was in
effect, or convert to the Base Rate if a LIBOR Interest Period was in effect and
is expiring. Any change in the Interest Rate shall be for the full LIBOR
Interest Period, if applicable, and any change of the Interest Rate is
applicable to the entire unpaid balance of the Note. Customer acknowledges that
the request pursuant to a Request Form is irrevocable and that the records of
MLBFS with respect to the Interest Rate, LIBOR Rate, LIBOR Rate Interest Option,
LIBOR Interest Period and the Base Rate shall be binding and conclusive on
Customer, absent manifest error.

3. PAYMENT AND OTHER TERMS. Customer shall pay the indebtedness under this Note
including without limitation, all principal, interest and fees, in full on the
Maturity Date. Interest shall be due (i) for periods in which the Base Rate is
in effect, the first day of each calendar month, and on the Maturity Date, and
(ii) for periods in which the LIBOR Rate is in effect, on that day which is one
calendar month following the first day of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period
(or, if there is no corresponding day, on the next succeeding day which is a
Business Day) and at the end of each such LIBOR Interest Period. Whenever any
payment to be made under the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is
not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day, subject to the definition of LIBOR Interest Period in the case of any
payment of the Note to which the LIBOR Rate applies, and such extension of time
shall in each such case be included in computing interest and commitment fees in
connection with such payment.

Each payment received hereunder shall be applied first to any fees and expenses
of MLBFS payable by Customer under the terms of the Loan Agreement (including,
without imitation, late charges), next to accrued interest at the Interest Rate,
with the balance applied on account of the unpaid principal hereof, or in such
other manner as the holder hereof may hereinafter determine from time to time
for the allocation of such payments thereof. Any part of the principal hereof or
interest hereon or other sums payable hereunder or under the Loan Agreement not
paid within ten (10) days of the applicable due date shall be subject to a late
charge equal to the lesser of (i) 5% of the overdue amount, or (ii) the maximum
amount permitted by law. All interest shall be computed on the basis of actual
days elapsed over a 360-day year. All sums payable hereunder shall be payable at
2356 Collections Center Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60693, or at such other place
or places as the holder hereof may from time to time appoint in writing.

Upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to MLBFS, Customer
may prepay this Note at any time in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the
foregoing (i) each prepayment must be in integral multiples of not less than
$1,000,000.00, and (ii) if a LIBOR Rate is in effect, prepayment may not be made
on any day other than the last day of the LIBOR Interest Period corresponding to
the LIBOR Rate, and (iii) each prepayment of principal must also include the
amount of any accrued but unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment. Each
notice of prepayment is irrevocable and must specify the payment date and the
principal amount of the Loan to be prepaid. If the Note is accruing interest at
a LIBOR Rate, and repayment occurs for any reason prior to the Maturity Date,
including a demand for payment by MLBFS upon the occurrence of a Default or
Event of Default, on a day other than the last day of the applicable LIBOR
Interest Period corresponding to the LIBOR Rate, Customer will pay MLBFS on
demand the amount MLBFS reasonably determines will compensate it for any loss
(including loss of profit), cost or expense incurred by MLBFS as a result of any
repayment of the Note on a date other than the last day of the applicable LIBOR
Interest Period.

This Note is the Note referred to in, and is entitled to all of the benefits of
the Loan Agreement and any Loan Documents. If Customer shall fail to pay when
due any sum due hereunder, and any such failure shall continue for more than
five (5) Business Days after written notice thereof shall have been given by the
holder hereof to Customer, or if any other Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, then at the option of the holder hereof (or, upon the
occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event, automatically, without any action on the
part of the holder hereof), and in addition to all other rights and remedies
available to such holder under the Loan Agreement, any Loan Documents, and
otherwise, the entire Loan Amount at such time remaining unpaid, together

<PAGE>

with accrued interest thereon and all other sums then owing by Customer under
the Loan Agreement, may be declared to be and thereby become immediately due and
payable.

It is expressly understood, however, that nothing contained in the Loan
Agreement, any other agreement, instrument or document executed by Customer, or
otherwise, shall affect or impair the right, which is unconditional and
absolute, of the holder hereof to enforce payment of all sums due under this
Note at or after maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, or shall affect
the obligation of Customer, which is also unconditional and absolute, to pay the
sums payable under this Note in accordance with its terms. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth herein or in the Loan Agreement, Customer hereby waives
presentment, demand for payment, protest and notice of protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of acceleration, notice of intent to accelerate and all other
notices and formalities in connection with this Note.

Wherever possible each provision of this Note shall be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision
of this Note shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision
shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Note. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Note, the Loan
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, no provision of this Note, the Loan
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents shall require the payment or permit the
collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
in any of the Loan Documents, no provision of the Loan Documents shall require
the payment or permit the collection of Excess Interest. If any Excess Interest
is provided for, or is adjudicated as being provided for, in this Note, the Loan
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, then: (a) Customer shall not be
obligated to pay any Excess Interest and (b) If any Excess Interest is provided
for, or is adjudicated as being provided for, in, then: (i) Customer shall not
be obligated to pay any Excess Interest; and (ii) any Excess Interest that MLBFS
may have received under any of the Loan Documents shall, at the option of MLBFS,
be applied as a credit against the then unpaid principal balance of this Note,
or accrued interest hereon not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law or
refunded to the payor thereof.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default, but without
limiting the rights and remedies otherwise available to MLBFS hereunder or
waiving such Default, the interest payable by Customer hereunder shall at the
option of MLBFS accrue and be payable at the Default Rate. The Default Rate,
once implemented, shall continue to apply to the Obligations under this Note,
the Loan Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and be payable by Customer until
the date MLBFS gives written notice (which shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld) that such Default has been cured to the satisfaction of MLBFS.

This Note shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Illinois and may be enforced by the holder hereof in any jurisdiction in which
the Loan Agreement may be enforced.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Note has been executed by Customer as of the day and
year first above written.

(b) MAINTENANCE OF PERFECTION. Customer will execute and deliver to MLBFS such

aggregate immediate market value of the Collateral will at all times during the
term hereof be not less than the Minimum Value. In determining the value of the
Collateral for the purposes of this Section, no value will be given to any
financial assets or investment property in or controlled through the Securities

6. EVENT OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following will constitute an

<PAGE>

such breach or violation within 10 Business Days after notice from MLBFS; or (c)
a default or Event of Default by customer shall occur under the terms of any
other agreement, instrument or document with or intended for the benefit of
MLBFS, MLPF&S or any of their affiliates, and any required notice shall have
been given and required passage of time shall have elapsed; or (d) if Customer's
subscription to the Securities Account shall be terminated for any reason; or
(e) any event shall occur which shall reasonably cause MLBFS to in good faith
believe that the prospect of payment or performance by Customer has been
materially impaired (determined in a manner consistent with the intent of
Section 1-208 of the UCC); or (f) if at any time the aggregate immediate market
value of the Collateral shall be or become an amount less than the Minimum Value
(determined in a manner consistent with Section 5(e) hereof, and Customer shall
not within 1 Business Day of written demand by MLBFS deposit into the Securities
Account additional financial assets or investment property acceptable to MLBFS
sufficient to increase such aggregate immediate market value to at least the
Minimum Value; or (g) any Bankruptcy Event shall occur.

7. REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any time
thereafter during the continuance thereof, MLBFS may, at its option, and in
addition to all other rights and remedies available to MLBFS: (a) by written
notice to MLPF&S, terminate all rights of Customer with respect to control of
the Collateral (it being understood, however, that upon the occurrence of any
Bankruptcy Event all rights of Customer with respect to control of the
Collateral shall automatically terminate without notice or other action on the
part of MLBFS), and thereby obtain the right to exclusive control over the
Collateral, including, without limitation, the right to cancel any open orders
and close any and all outstanding contracts, liquidate all or any part of the
Collateral, transfer the Securities Account or any other Collateral to the name
of MLBFS or its nominee, and withdraw any Collateral from the Securities
Account; and (b) exercise any one or more of the rights and remedies of a
secured party under the UCC. Any sale of Collateral pursuant to this Paragraph
may be made at MLBFS' discretion on any exchange or other market where such
business is usually transacted, or at public auction or private sale, and MLBFS
or MLBFS' agent may at any such sale be the purchaser for the account of MLBFS
or such agent. The proceeds of sale or other disposition of any of the
Collateral shall be applied by MLBFS on account of the Obligations, with any
excess paid over to Customer or its successors or assigns, as their interests
and rights may appear, or whoever else may then be adjudged entitled thereto. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, customer waives notice of any sale,
advertisement and all other notices and formalities whatsoever. All rights and
remedies available to MLBFS hereunder shall be cumulative and in addition to all
other rights and remedies otherwise available to it at law, in equity or
otherwise, and any one or more of such rights and remedies may be exercised
simultaneously or successively. No waiver by MLBFS of any Event of Default shall
waive any other or subsequent Event of Default. None of the provisions hereof
shall be held to have been waived by any act or knowledge of MLBFS, but only by
a written instrument executed by an officer of MLBFS and delivered to Customer.

8. POWER OF ATTORNEY. Customer further agrees that MLBFS shall have and hereby
irrevocably grants to MLBFS, effective upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, the full and irrevocable right, power and
authority in the name of Customer or in MLBFS' own name, to demand, collect,
withdraw, receipt for and sue for the Securities Account and any or all of the
other Collateral, and all amounts due or to become due and payable upon or with
respect to the Collateral; to execute any withdrawal receipts respecting any or
all of the collateral; to endorse the name of Customer on any and all commercial
paper and other instruments given in payment therefor; and, in its discretion,
to take any and all further action (including, without limitation, the transfer
of the Securities Account or any other Collateral to the name of MLBFS or its
nominee) which MLBFS shall deem necessary or appropriate to preserve or protect
its interests hereunder.

9. RIGHTS ABSOLUTE. The rights of MLBFS hereunder and with respect to the
Collateral are absolute and unconditional, and nothing that MLBFS does or leaves
undone shall affect such rights of MLBFS. Without limiting the foregoing, MLBFS
shall not as a condition of such rights be required to resort to any other
collateral or security, pursue or exhaust any remedy against Customer or any
other party or observe any formality of notice or otherwise (except as expressly
provided herein); and (ii) Customer hereby consents to, and waives notice of,
any extension, renewal or modification from time to time of any of the Loan
Agreements or any other agreement, instrument or document evidencing or securing
the Obligations, any extensions, forbearances, compromises or releases of any of
the Obligations, and the release of any party primarily or secondarily obligated
for the Obligations or of any other collateral therefor.

10. LIMITATION OF MLBFS' OBLIGATIONS. MLBFS shall not as a result of this
Security Agreement be subjected to any obligation or liability of Customer of
any manner or type with respect to the Collateral, including, but not limited
to, the duty to perform any covenants and agreements made by Customer; all of
which obligations and liabilities shall continue to rest upon Customer as though
this Security Agreement had not been made.

11. MLPF&S NOT AUTHORIZED. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING
THE AFFILIATION BETWEEN MLBFS AND MLPF&S, AND THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP
ACKNOWLEDGED BY MLPF&S IN THE CONSENT HERETO, NEITHER MLPF&S NOR ANY OF ITS
EMPLOYEES ARE AUTHORIZED TO WAIVE ON BEHALF OF MLBFS ANY PROVISION HEREOF, OR
CONSENT ON BEHALF OF MLBFS TO ANY ACTION OR INACTION BY CUSTOMER, OR OTHERWISE
BIND MLBFS.

12. TERM. This Security Agreement shall become effective when signed by
Customer, and shall continue in effect so long thereafter as any of the Loan
Agreements shall be in effect or there shall be any Obligations outstanding.

13. MISCELLANEOUS.

(a) Customer waives notice of the acceptance hereof by MLBFS.

(b) Titles to Paragraphs are for convenience only and shall not be considered in
the interpretation hereof.

(c) This Security Agreement shall be binding upon Customer and Customer's heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns, as applicable, and shall inure
to the benefit of MLBFS and its successors and assigns. If there is more than
one "Customer", their obligations hereunder are joint and several.

(d) THIS WRITTEN SECURITY AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, MAY BE MODIFIED ONLY BY A
WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY BOTH MLBFS AND CUSTOMER, AND MAY NOT BE
CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

<PAGE>

(e) THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF ILLINOIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF MLBFS TO ENFORCE THIS SECURITY
AGREEMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION AND VENUE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (I)
CUSTOMER AGREES THAT THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT MAY AT THE OPTION OF MLBFS BE
ENFORCED BY MLBFS IN ANY JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN WHICH ANY OF THE LOAN
AGREEMENTS MAY BE ENFORCED, (II) CUSTOMER IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS ITSELF TO
JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND VENUE IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN
THE COUNTY OF COOK FOR SUCH PURPOSES, AND (III) CUSTOMER WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO CONTEST SAID JURISDICTION AND VENUE AND THE CONVENIENCE OF ANY SUCH
FORUM AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REMOVE SUCH ACTION FROM STATE TO FEDERAL COURT.
CUSTOMER FURTHER AGREES THAT ANY CLAIM BY CUSTOMER AGAINST MLBFS HEREUNDER OR
WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE BROUGHT
AGAINST MLBFS ONLY IN AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN A FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN THE
COUNTY OF COOK AND STATE OF ILLINOIS, AND CUSTOMER WAIVES THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY
SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING OR ASSERT ANY COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST MLBFS IN ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION OR BEFORE ANY OTHER FORUM. CUSTOMER FURTHER WAIVES THE RIGHT TO
BRING ANY NON-COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIMS.

(f) CUSTOMER AND MLBFS HEREBY EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THE
PARTIES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
SECURITY AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE LOAN AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
