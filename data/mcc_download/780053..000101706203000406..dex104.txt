agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,

definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of

amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating

approved by the Administrative Agent and must be received by the Administrative
Agent by telecopy, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later
than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the proposed
date of such Competitive Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform
substantially to the form approved by the Administrative Agent may be rejected
by the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the
applicable Lender of such rejection as promptly as practicable. Each Competitive
Bid shall specify (i) the principal amount (which shall be a minimum of
$5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire
principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing requested by the Borrower) of the

          (c) Notification of Bids by Administrative Agent. The Administrative

extent it has decided to accept or reject each Competitive Bid, in the case of a
Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 1:30 p.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before the date of the proposed Competitive Borrowing;
provided that (i) the failure of the Borrower to give such notice shall be

accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the
Borrower rejects a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii)
the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of the requested Competitive Borrowing specified in
the related Competitive Bid Request, (iv) to the extent necessary to comply with
clause (iii) of this proviso, the Borrower may accept Competitive Bids at the
------------
same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which acceptance, in the case of multiple
Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in
accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid, and (v) except pursuant
to clause (iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive
   -----------
Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000
and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided further that if a Competitive
Loan must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of
clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or
-----------
any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of
acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular Competitive
Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be rounded to integral
                     -----------
multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the Borrower. A notice given
by the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable.

          (e) Notification of Acceptances by the Administrative Agent. The
              -------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender by telecopy
whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if so, the amount and
Competitive Bid Rate so accepted), and each successful bidder will thereupon
become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make the
Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.

          (f) Bids by the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent
              --------------------------------
shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall
submit such Competitive Bid directly to the Borrower at least one quarter of an
hour earlier than the time by which the other Lenders are required to submit
their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) of
                                                               -------------
this Section.

          (g) Funding of Competitive Loans. Any Lender whose offer to make any
              ----------------------------

the date specified for the making of such Loan, make available the amount of
such Loan to the Administrative Agent as specified by the Administrative Agent,
in immediately available funds, for account of the Borrower. The amount so

of this Agreement, be made available to the Borrower by 1:00 p.m., New York City
time, on such date by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower at the time of its acceptance of a

              -------
Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender,

terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other
agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with,
the Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall control. Letters of

Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments.

          (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension. To request
              ---------------------------------------------------
the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an
outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or
transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been
approved by the Issuing Lender) to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative
Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be
a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which

with any request for a Letter of Credit.

          (c) Limitations on Amounts. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
              ----------------------
amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and
warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed $30,000,000, (ii) the
sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the total Commitments and
(iii) the minimum face amount of a Letter of Credit shall be $250,000.

          (d) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
              ---------------
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) unless otherwise
consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender and (ii) the
date that is ten Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

          (e) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
              --------------
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof), and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the Issuing
Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the
Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower in accordance with clause (f) of this Section)
                                              ----------
promptly upon the request of the Issuing Lender at any time from the time of
such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or
at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

          (f) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC
              -------------
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that
the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,

if such LC Disbursement is not less than $3,000,000, the Borrower may, subject
to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
------------    ----
Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's
obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment
when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and

                                Credit Agreement

                                      -24-

such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
            ------------                                                -------
2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
----              ----------------
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Lender the
amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other
than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

          (g) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
              --------------------
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute,
                             -------------
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations
hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lender,
nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit
or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of
the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond
the control of the Issuing Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not be
construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the
extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lender's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to
documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance
with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

          (h) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Lender shall, promptly
              -----------------------
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Lender has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (i) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC
              ----------------
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply.
            -------------                       ---------------
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
                       -------------
Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to

                                Credit Agreement

the extent of such payment.

          (j) Replacement of the Issuing Lender. The Issuing Lender may be
              ---------------------------------
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing Lender. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the replaced Issuing
Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any
                   ---------------
such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and
obligations of the Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have
all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall
not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

          (k) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
              ----------------------
continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 66.66%
of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to
this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative
Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit
                                     --------
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (i) or (j) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the
             ----------    ---    -----------
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall
have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment
of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense,
such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 66.66% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower
is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived. The Borrower shall,
concurrently with the deposit of the cash collateral, deliver to the
Administrative Agent such documents and agreements as shall be reasonably
required by the Administrative Agent in order to perfect a first priority
security interest in such cash collateral, duly executed by the Borrower and in
favor of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders).

     SECTION 2.07. Funding of Borrowings.
                   ---------------------

          (a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by
              ------------------
it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice
to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Revolving Borrowing
Request or Competitive Bid Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f)
                                                               ---------------
shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Lender.

          (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative
              ---------------------------------------
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent
such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in
-------------

                                Credit Agreement

                                      -26-

reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.08. Interest Elections.
                   ------------------

          (a) Elections by the Borrower for Revolving Borrowings. Each Revolving
              --------------------------------------------------
Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Revolving
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall
have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Revolving Borrowing
Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a
different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which
case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the
Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion
shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to
Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

          (b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section,
              -------------------
the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone
by the time that a Revolving Borrowing Request would be required under Section
                                                                       -------
2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting
----
from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such
telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Interest Election Request in the form set forth in Exhibit D (or such other form
                                                   ---------
approved by the Administrative Agent) and signed by the Borrower.

          (c) Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and
              -----------------------------------------
written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:
                ------------

               (i)   the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
     applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
     different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
     resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant
     to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
     Borrowing);

               (ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
     Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
     or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

               (iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d) Notice by the Administrative Agent to Lenders. Promptly following
              ---------------------------------------------
receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise
each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each
resulting Borrowing.

                                Credit Agreement

          (e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If the Borrower fails to
              -----------------------------------
deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such
Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

     SECTION 2.09. Termination, Reduction and Extension of the Commitments.
                   -------------------------------------------------------

          (a) Scheduled Termination. Unless previously terminated, the
              ---------------------
Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

          (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower may at any time
              ----------------------------------
terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000, (ii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the total
Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Competitive Loans would exceed the total Commitments and (iii) terminations
and/or reductions may not be made more than one (1) time in any given calendar
quarter.

          (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower shall
              --------------------------------------------
notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least five Business Days
                  -------------
prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such
election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any
notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be
irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered
by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness
of a particular transaction or other credit facilities, in which case such
notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on
or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

          (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction. Any termination or reduction
              ----------------------------------
of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments.

          (e) Extension of Maturity Date. Subject to the provisions of this
              --------------------------
Section 2.09(e), the Borrower shall have one option to extend the Maturity Date
---------------
for one (1) year to November 7, 2006, subject to the satisfaction of each of the
following conditions:

               (i)   The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its
     exercise of the applicable option at least 90 days, but not more than 180

     continuing at the time of giving such notice pursuant to clause (i) above
     or on the originally scheduled Maturity Date;

               (iii) unless otherwise disclosed to and approved by the Required
     Lenders, the representations and warranties made by the Borrower in the
     Loan Documents shall have been true and correct in all material respects
     when made and shall also be true and correct in all material respects on
     the originally scheduled Maturity Date (except, if any such representation
     or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as
     of such specific date);

               (iv)  the Borrower shall have delivered updates to the
     Administrative Agent of all the Schedules referred to in Article III hereof
                                                              -----------

     Agent in its reasonable judgment;

               (v)   At the time of the exercise of the extension hereunder, the

     that the Borrower is in compliance with the covenants set forth in Article
                                                                        -------

     --
     forty-five days prior to such date and (B) a certificate of a Financial
     Officer of Borrower certifying that such Financial Officer has no knowledge
     of any change since the end of such applicable Measuring Period that would
     cause Borrower to not be in compliance with the covenants set forth in
     Article VI;

               (vi)  The Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent
     (for the ratable benefit of the Lenders) a non-refundable extension fee

     unused Commitments of the Lenders prior to the originally scheduled
     Maturity Date; and

               (vii) The Borrower shall have paid all reasonable out-of-pocket

     SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
                   ------------------------------------

          (a) Repayment. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the
              ---------
Loans as follows:

               (i)   to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender
     the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity
     Date, and

               (ii)  to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
     respective Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan
     of such Lender on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such
     Loan.

          (b) Manner of Payment. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any
              -----------------
Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to
be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such selection not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing and one Business Day before the scheduled date of such
repayment in the case of an ABR Borrowing; provided that each repayment of
Borrowings shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings before any
other Borrowings. If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the
Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied,
first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in
the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the
Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first), and
for these purposes, Competitive Loans shall be deemed to be in the same Class as
Loans. Each payment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in such Borrowing.

          (c) Maintenance of Loan Accounts by Lenders. Each Lender shall
              ---------------------------------------

such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (d) Maintenance of Loan Accounts by the Administrative Agent. The
              --------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the
amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder
for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (e) Effect of Entries. The entries made in the accounts maintained
              -----------------
pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence

such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

     such Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as
     originally in effect and otherwise duly completed.

               (ii)   Competitive Notes. The Competitive Loans made by any
                      -----------------
     Lender shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Borrower
     substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, dated the date hereof, payable to
                                  -----------
     such Lender in an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of the
     Commitments and otherwise duly completed.

               (iii)  Substitution, Exchange and Subdivision of Notes. No
                      -----------------------------------------------
     Lender shall be entitled to have its Notes substituted or exchanged for any
     reason, or subdivided for promissory notes of lesser denominations, except

               (ii)  Application. Prepayments and/or reductions of Commitments
                     -----------
     pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied to reduce the aggregate amount
     of the Commitments (and to the extent that, after giving effect to such
     reduction, the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the
     aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed
     the Commitments, the Borrower shall, first, prepay Revolving Loans, second,

reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that,
if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice
                                                  ------------
of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice

relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall
be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving
Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to

Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such
                                                        --------
Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment
terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount
of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which
its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases
to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in
arrears on each Quarterly Date and on the date on which the Commitments

elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the
              ---------------------
Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a participation fee with respect
to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per
annum equal to the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate
applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans (plus 4% during the continuance of an
Event of Default) on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Lender
a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender on the average daily
amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as
the Issuing Lender's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including
each Quarterly Date shall be payable on such Quarterly Date, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees
shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such
fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable
on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this
paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees
and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

          (c) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
              -------------------------
Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent.

          (d) Payment of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the
              ---------------
dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to
the Issuing Lender, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the
case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto.
Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.13. Interest.
                   --------

          (a) ABR Loans. The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
              ---------
interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

          (b) Eurodollar Loans. The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing
              ----------------
shall bear interest (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Rate, or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, at
the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or
minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable to such Loan.

          (c) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal
              ----------------
of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid within 5 days of when due (except default interest shall
accrue immediately with respect to (x) principal payment from the date when such
payment is due and (y) any payments that are not made on the Maturity Date),
whether upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case
of overdue principal of any Loan, 4% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such
Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case
of any other amount, 4% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.
-------------

          (d) Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be
              -------------------
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case
of Revolving Loans and Competitive Loans, upon termination of the Commitments;
provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
                                               -------------
shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of
the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end
of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be
payable on the effective date of such conversion.

          (e) Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis
              -----------
of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime
Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate
Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

     SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
                   --------------------------
the Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable,
for such Interest Period;

          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to
make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for
such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included
in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; or

          (c) the Administrative Agent is advised by a Lender that it has become
unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans hereunder;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing
shall be ineffective (in the case of clause (c) above, only as to the affected
                                     ----------
Lender), (ii) if any Revolving

Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing
shall be made as an ABR Revolving Borrowing (in the case of clause (c) above,
                                                            ----------
only as to the affected Lender), (iii) any request by the Borrower for a
Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that (A) if the
circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then
requests by the Borrower for Eurodollar Competitive Borrowings may be made to
Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise
to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Types of
Borrowings shall be permitted and (iv) if in accordance with clause (c) above
                                                             ----------
any Lender determines that it is no longer lawful for such Lender or its
applicable lending office (subject to Section 2.19(a)) to maintain any existing
                                      ---------------
Eurodollar Loans, or to continue to charge interest rates based upon the LIBO
Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to continue Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist and, in such event, all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall be converted
to ABR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day,
or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans.

     SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs.
                   ---------------

          (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
              -------------------------

               (i)   impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
     account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
     requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Lender; or

               (ii)  impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or the London
     interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
     Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lenders of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, in
accordance with and subject to Section 2.15(c), the Borrower will promptly on
                               ---------------
demand pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

          (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Lender
              --------------------
determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters
of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender
or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender's or the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or
the Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then, in
accordance with and subject to Section 2.15(c), from time to time the Borrower
                               ---------------
will promptly on demand pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
Issuing Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company for any
such reduction suffered.

          (c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender or the
              -------------------------
Issuing Lender setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or its holding
company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
                                             -------------    ---
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof. No Lender or Issuing Lender shall have the right to
collect payments from the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this
                                               -------------    ---
Section unless it is the policy of such Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable,
at the time of collection, to collect similar payments from borrowers in
connection with credit facilities similar to those made available pursuant to
this

                                Credit Agreement

Agreement.

          (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or
              -----------------
the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's right to demand
such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that
such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lender's or the Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          (e) Competitive Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
              -----------------
this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this
Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would
otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced
prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

     SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
                   ----------------------
any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
                                                                        -------
2.11(c) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any
-------
Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e)
the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender
------------
for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

     SECTION 2.17. Taxes.
                   -----

          (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of
              ----------------------
any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

          (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. In addition, the Borrower
              --------------------------------------
shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

          (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the
              -------------------------------
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any

                                Credit Agreement
                                ----------------

<PAGE>

                                      -34-

Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender
or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by
or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Lender, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing
Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
              --------------------
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Foreign Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
              ---------------
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          (f) Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in
              -------
its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
                                                      ------------
over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with
                                                             ------------
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to
require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to
the Borrower or any other Person.

     SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
                   ----------------------------------------------------------

          (a) Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment
              ------------------------
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
                                                               ------------

----    ----
extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at the
Administrative Agent's Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
relevant Loan Document, and except payments to be made directly to the Issuing
Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
-------------  ----  ----     ----
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise
provided therein) shall be made in dollars.

          (b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient
              ------------------------------------
funds are received by and

available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

          (c) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
              ------------------
herein: (i) each Revolving Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each
payment of commitment fee under Section 2.12 shall be made for the account of
                                ------------
the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments
under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the
      ------------
Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii)
each Revolving Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according
to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of
Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans (in the case of conversions and
continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of
Revolving Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro
rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving
Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by the
Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with
the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective
Lenders.

          (d) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising
              ------------------------------
any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of
any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in
LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion
received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion
shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary
so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably
in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements;
provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or
participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (e) Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
              -----------------------
have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing
Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount
due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed
to such Lender or the Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from
and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

          (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender
              ----------------------------------------------
shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section
                                                                     -------
2.06(e) or (f), 2.07(b) or 2.18(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its
-------    ---  -------    -------
discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to
satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections
until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

     SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
                   ----------------------------------------------

          (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests
              -----------------------------------------
compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
                   ------------
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable
                       ------------
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not
   ------------    ----
subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

          (b) Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender is unable to make or
              ----------------------
maintain Eurodollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.14(c), (ii)any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.15, (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any
                   ------------
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or (iv) any Lender defaults in its
                       ------------
obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests,
                                         ------------
rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding
Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (B)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC
Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim
for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to
                       ------------
Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
------------
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                            ------------------------

         Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its
behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

         The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiary
Entities or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

         The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or
by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to
exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other
------------
Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose,
and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiary Entities that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under
the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), or in the absence of its own
                                 ------------
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed
not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of
any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or
in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any
of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or
                                                                ----------
elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more subagents appointed
by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any

                                Credit Agreement

such subagent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and
powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of
the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the approval
of the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing),
to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Lender, with the approval of the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
------------
Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

             --------------------------------------
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right
or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders
hereunderare cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that
they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or

                                                -------------
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

         (b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
             ----------
waived or Modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing

or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or
reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the

written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof

written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case
may be.

addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof

conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register

this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
                                                                    ---------
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
---
Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No

         (c) Participations.
             --------------

         (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                            -----------
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender
sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
                                                                    -------
9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
-------                                           -----------------
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a
            -------------  ----     ----
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
                                                               -------------
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
                            ------------
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a
                                         ---------------
Lender.

         (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
      ------------    ----
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower
                                                ------------
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
                                                        ---------------
though it were a Lender.

         (d) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
             ---------------
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment

                                Credit Agreement

to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not
apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto.

         (e) No Assignments to the Borrower or Affiliates. Anything in this
             --------------------------------------------
Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any
interest in any Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to the Borrower, any
Nationwide Core Entity or any of their Affiliates without the prior consent of
each Lender.

     SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
                   --------
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article
                                 -------------  ----  ----     ----     -------
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
----
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

     SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may
                   ----------------------------------------
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
------------
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
                   ------------
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
                   ---------------
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or

     SECTION 9.13. Additional Commitments.
                   ----------------------

         Upon the request of the Borrower (such request, the "Additional
                                                              ----------
Syndication Notice") given to the Administrative Agent within twenty-four (24)
------------------
months after the date of this Agreement, and provided that there is no Default
or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain additional Commitments in the aggregate amount of up to Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (the "Additional Commitment Amount"), subject to
                                    ----------------------------
the following:

         (a) Promptly after delivery of the Additional Syndication Notice, the
Administrative Agent shall request that the existing Lenders accept a pro rata
share of the Additional Commitment Amount. If any Lender rejects the offer to
increase its respective Commitment or accepts only a portion thereof, which each
Lender may do in its sole and absolute discretion, the Administrative Agent
shall further offer the rejected shares (or rejected portions thereof) to the
Lenders that have accepted the proposed increase in their Commitments (each an
"Accepting Lender"), pro rata based on the sum of their then existing
 ----------------
Commitments plus any additional portion of the Additional Commitment Amount
which they have previously accepted. If any Lender shall not respond to a
request by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this clause (a) within ten (10)
                                                     ----------
Business Days after receipt of an offer (including any offer for a portion of
the Additional Commitment Amount rejected by another Lender), such Lender shall
be deemed to have rejected such offer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower of all acceptances and rejections with respect to the Additional
Commitment Amount by the Lenders. If such acceptances are satisfactory to the
Borrower, the Commitments of the Accepting Lenders shall be increased by their
respective portions of the Additional Commitment Amount without the consent of
any other Lender, subject, however, to (i) no Default or Event of Default being
in existence at such time, (ii) the Borrower issuing substitute Notes, (iii) the
Accepting Lenders paying to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the other
Lenders) the aggregate amount determined by the Administrative Agent to be
necessary so that each Initial Accepting Lender's pro rata share of outstanding
Loans and LC Exposure matches the ratio of its increased Commitment to the
aggregate amount of all revised Commitments after giving effect to the
Additional Commitment Amount, (iv) the Borrower, the Accepting Lenders and the
Administrative Agent executing such other documents evidencing such adjustments
in the Commitments and the Loans as shall be reasonable acceptable to the
Borrower, the Accepting Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender
and (v) the Borrower paying all of the Administrative Agent's reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Lenders their share of any payments
received from the Accepting Lenders in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the
Lenders do not accept increases in their aggregate Commitments in the full
amount of the Additional Commitment Amount in accordance with paragraph (a)
                                                              -------------
above, the Borrower may designate one or more proposed lenders to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender to become Lenders under this
Agreement with respect to such balance of the Additional Commitment Amount (but
in no event with proposed commitments of less than $5,000,000 unless the
Administrative Agent consents thereto), subject in each case to the prior
approval of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, which approvals
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such proposed lenders meet the
standards of an Eligible Assignee. If such proposed lenders are so approved,
such lenders shall become

additional Lenders under this Agreement in accordance with their respective
Commitments without the consent of any other Lenders, subject, however, to (i)
no Default or Event of Default being in existence at such time, (ii) the
Borrower issuing substitute Notes to the new Lenders, (iii) such new Lenders
paying to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the other Lenders) the
aggregate amount determined by the Administrative Agent to be necessary so that
each new Lender's pro rata share of outstanding Loans and LC Exposure matches
the ratio of its Commitment to the aggregate amount of all Commitments after
giving effect to the Additional Commitment Amount, (iv) the Borrower, the new
Lenders and the Administrative Agent executing such other documents evidencing
their addition as Lenders hereunder and the adjustment of the Commitments and
Loans as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Issuing Lender, including each such new Lender's compliance with
the provisions of clauses (ii), (iii) and (v) of Section 9.04(b), and (v) the
                  ------------  -----     ---    ---------------
Borrower paying all of the Administrative Agent's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Administrative Agent shall
