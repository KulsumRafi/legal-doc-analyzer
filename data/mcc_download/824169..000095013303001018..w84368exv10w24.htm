bear the cost of its own and Executive&#146;s experts, evidence
and counsel in such arbitration proceeding, but the
arbitrator&#146;s award may provide that, in addition to any
other amounts or relief due to Employer, Executive shall
reimburse Employer for all or any part of the costs of
Executive&#146;s experts, evidence and counsel initially
incurred by Employer, to the extent the award finds such costs
properly allocable to any issue(s) in dispute as to which the
award indicates the Employer to be the prevailing party.
