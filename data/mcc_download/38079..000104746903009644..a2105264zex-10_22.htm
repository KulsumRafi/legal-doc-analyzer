whole shares of Stock. Unless and until a certificate or certificates representing such shares shall have been issued by the Company to Employee, Employee (or the person permitted to exercise this

person or entity, including a "group" as contemplated by Section&nbsp;13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), acquires or gains ownership or control
(including, without limitation, power to vote) of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company's voting stock (based upon voting power) or (v)&nbsp;as a result of or in connection with a
contested election of directors, the persons who were directors of the Company before that election shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board. For purposes of clause&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;in
Section&nbsp;4(c)&nbsp;above, the "Change in Control Value" shall equal the amount determined in clause&nbsp;(A), (B)&nbsp;or (C), whichever is applicable, as follows: (A)&nbsp;the per share
price offered to shareholders of the Company in any merger, consolidation, sale of assets or dissolution transaction, (B)&nbsp;the price per share offered to shareholders of the Company in any
tender offer or exchange offer whereby a Corporate Change takes place, or (C)&nbsp;if such Corporate Change occurs other than pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, the fair market value per share
of the shares into which this Option is exercisable, as determined by the Committee as of the date determined by the Committee to be the date of cancellation and surrender of this Option. In the event
that the consideration offered to shareholders of the Company in any transaction described in this Section&nbsp;4(d)&nbsp;or Section&nbsp;4(c)&nbsp;above consists of anything other than cash,
the Committee shall determine the fair cash equivalent of the portion of the consideration offered which is other than cash. </FONT></P>
