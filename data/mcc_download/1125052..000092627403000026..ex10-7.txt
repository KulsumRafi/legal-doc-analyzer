PLEDGED, OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
UNDER SAID ACT OR LAWS, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY
THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT".

3.07     Specific Performance

The Company and Newco recognize that the rights of the Shareholders under this
