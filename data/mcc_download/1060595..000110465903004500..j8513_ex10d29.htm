level based on said change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required
to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general accounts. Within

or applied by Lessor. No part of the Security Deposit shall be considered to be
held in trust, to bear interest or to be prepayment for any monies to be paid
by Lessee under this Lease.</font></p>

Mortgage placed upon the Demised Premises provided that, in each such case the

non-disturbance agreement which provides that, so long as Lessee is not in
default under this Lease beyond any applicable cure period, no default under
the Mortgage and no proceeding to foreclose the same, deed in lieu of
foreclosure, or the exercise or attempted exercise of any right or remedy under
the Mortgage will disturb Lessee&#146;s possession or other rights under the Lease
(including any right of Lessee to renew or extend the term thereof) and the
Lease will not be affected or cut off thereby. Lessee shall execute from time
to time such subordination, attornment and other agreements as Lessor or any
mortgagee may reasonably require to effectuate the terms of this&#160; paragraph (which agreements may contain terms
and conditions customarily required by institutional lenders), subject to the
reasonable approval of Lessee.</p>
