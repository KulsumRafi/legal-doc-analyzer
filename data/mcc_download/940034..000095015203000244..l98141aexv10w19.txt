                           THE CLOSING; PURCHASE PRICE

         3.1 PLACE AND DATE. The closing of the sale and purchase of the
Transferred Assets (the "CLOSING") and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, at such place upon which the parties
may agree, not later than (i) five business days


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions referred to in Articles
11 and 12, or (ii) seven business days after the Sale Order is entered,
whichever is later, or (iii) as otherwise agreed between Buyer and Seller. The
day on which the Closing actually occurs is sometimes referred to herein as the
"CLOSING DATE." Notwithstanding the actual time of Closing on the Closing Date,
the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred as of 12:01 a.m., local time, on
the Closing Date (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

         3.2 PURCHASE PRICE. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the purchase price for the Transferred Assets shall be
Five Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($5,950,000) (the "CASH
PORTION") plus the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities plus or minus, as
applicable, the Working Capital Adjustment (collectively the "PURCHASE PRICE").

         3.3 DEPOSIT. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
shall deliver to National City Bank (the "ESCROW AGENT"), an amount equal to Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the "DEPOSIT") as a deposit toward the Cash
Portion of the Purchase Price. The Deposit shall be held and invested pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement dated as of the date hereof
(the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent, in
substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B. The Deposit, together with
interest earned thereon (the "ESCROWED DEPOSIT") shall be credited towards the
Cash Portion of the Purchase Price at the Closing. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 13.1(c)(ii) solely as a result of the failure to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 12.1, 12.2, 12.4 (except as it
relates to 12.3), 12.7, 12.8, 12.9 or 12.10 (unless such failure to satisfy
Section 12.2, 12.4, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9 or 12.10 results from a failure of any
condition set forth in Article 11), then the Escrow Agent shall pay the Escrowed
Deposit to Seller and if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.1
for any other reason, then the Escrow Agent shall pay the Escrowed Deposit to
Buyer.

         3.4 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE.

             (a) The parties shall allocate the aggregate consideration received
by Seller with respect to the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Tax Code, as
mutually agreed to by the parties within seven (7) business days following the
parties' agreement with respect to the Working Capital Adjustment pursuant to
the procedure described below. Subject to the requirements of any applicable Tax
law or election, all such mutually agreed to allocations shall be used by each
party in preparing any filings required pursuant to Section 1060 of the Tax Code
or any similar provisions of state or local law and all relevant Income Tax
Returns. Neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position before any taxing
authority or in any judicial proceeding with respect to Income Taxes that is
inconsistent with such mutually agreed to allocations without the prior written
consent of the other party, in the consenting party's commercially reasonable
discretion. The parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
support such mutually agreed to reported allocations in any audit proceedings
initiated by any taxing authority.

             (b) Within 30 days after the date the parties agree to the Working
Capital Adjustment, Buyer will provide to Seller copies of IRS Form 8594 and any
required exhibits thereto with Buyer's proposed allocation of the consideration
received by Seller with respect to


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

the Transferred Assets for Seller's approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If Seller fails to respond to Buyer within 30 days of Seller receiving
such IRS Form 8594, then Seller shall be deemed to have approved Buyer's
allocation.

         3.5 DELIVERIES. At the Closing: (a) Buyer shall deliver to, or as
directed by Seller, the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price, less an amount equal
to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the "PURCHASE PRICE ESCROW AMOUNT"),
less the Escrowed Deposit, and the agreements, instruments of assumption,
certificates and other documents required to be delivered by Buyer pursuant to
Article 12; (b) Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Purchase Price
Escrow Amount and $200,000 (the "BUYER ESCROW AMOUNT", and collectively with the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount, together with interest earned thereon, the
"WORKING CAPITAL ESCROW AMOUNT"), which sum shall be disbursed in accordance
with the adjustment described in Section 3.6(c) below and the Escrow Agreement;
(c) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the agreements, instruments of transfer,
certificates and other documents required to be delivered by Seller pursuant to
Article 11; and (d) Seller shall deliver to Buyer such other documents
reasonably requested by Buyer to memorialize the Contemplated Transactions.

         3.6 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

             (a) If as of the Effective Time, Current Assets of the Business
that are included as Transferred Assets minus Current Liabilities of the
Business that are included as Assumed Liabilities (the foregoing calculation
referred to as "WORKING CAPITAL") exceed $3,408,192 ("TARGET WORKING CAPITAL"),
the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar for dollar by
the amount of such excess. If the Working Capital as of the Effective Time is
less than the Target Working Capital, the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price
shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of such deficiency. The
foregoing adjustment to the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall be referred
to as the "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT". A sample Working Capital calculation is
attached hereto as Exhibit C. The calculation of Working Capital as of the
Effective Time, shall be done in accordance with the past practices of Seller
and shall be applied on a consistent basis throughout all the periods identified
and consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

             (b) The Working Capital Adjustment shall be determined as follows:

                          (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
             Closing Date, but in no event later than the twenty-first (21st)
             day following the Closing Date, Seller (with the cooperation of
             Buyer) shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule detailing the
             amount and computation of the Working Capital Adjustment and final
             Purchase Price ("CLOSING SCHEDULE"). Buyer will give Seller
             reasonable access to the Books and Records for the purpose of
             preparing the Closing Schedule and reasonable access to the
             appropriate personnel of Buyer for the purpose of calculating the
             amounts set forth in the Closing Schedule.

                          (ii) Unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing ("DISPUTE
             NOTICE") that Buyer disagrees with the amount of the Working
             Capital Adjustment contained in the Closing Schedule no later than
             ten (10) days after receipt of the Closing


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Schedule, the Closing Schedule shall be conclusive and binding on Buyer and
Seller and deemed final.

                          (iii) If Buyer delivers a Dispute Notice to Seller,
             Buyer and Seller shall attempt to amicably resolve their
             differences with respect thereto in good faith. If Buyer and Seller
             are unable to resolve any disputed item within ten (10) days of
             delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the parties shall submit the
             issues in dispute to an accounting firm (the "RESOLVING
             ACCOUNTANTS") mutually acceptable to both parties or, in the
             absence of agreement, to an accounting firm of national reputation
             selected by lot after eliminating the parties' principal outside
             accountants and one additional firm designated as objectionable by
             each of Buyer and Seller. If the disputed issues are submitted to
             the Resolving Accountants, each party shall furnish to the
             Resolving Accountants such work papers and other documents and
             information relating to the disputed issues as the Resolving
             Accountants may request and are available to such party, and each
             will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Resolving
             Accountants any material relating to the determination and to
             discuss the determination with the Resolving Accountants. Each
             party shall be entitled to request and receive information from the
             other which the Resolving Accountants determine is or may be
             relevant to the resolution of the disputed issues. The Resolving
             Accountants shall be required to make a decision within thirty (30)
             days of the date of their acceptance of their appointment as the
             Resolving Accountants. The determination of the Resolving
             Accountants, as set forth in a written notice delivered to the
             parties by the Resolving Accountants (the "NOTICE OF
             DETERMINATION"), shall be binding and conclusive on the parties
             absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the
             Resolving Accountants shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

                          (iv) Upon resolution of such disputed issues, whether
             by agreement of the parties or by determination of the Resolving
             Accountants, Buyer and the Seller Parties shall promptly jointly
             execute a direction letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
             Agent to release the Working Capital Escrow Amount, to Buyer or
             Seller, or both, as the case may be, in accordance with Section
             3.6(c).

             (c) The Working Capital Adjustment and the Working Capital Escrow
Amount shall be paid as follows:

                          (i) If the Working Capital as set forth on the final
             Closing Schedule equals the Target Working Capital, then one-half
             (1/2) of the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall immediately be
             disbursed to Seller and one-half (1/2) of the Working Capital
             Escrow Amount shall immediately be disbursed to Buyer.

                          (ii) If the Working Capital as set forth on the final
             Closing Schedule exceeds the Target Working Capital, then:

                                       (x) an amount equal to $200,000 plus such
                          excess, together with interest actually earned on such
                          sum, shall immediately be disbursed from the Working
                          Capital Escrow Amount to Seller, and



                                      -9-
<PAGE>

                                       (y) the balance of the Working Capital
                          Escrow Amount, if any, shall immediately be disbursed
                          to Buyer;

                          PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such excess exceeds
                          $200,000, (i) all of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
                          shall immediately be disbursed to Seller, and (ii) an
                          amount equal to such excess less $200,000 shall be
                          paid by Buyer to Seller. Any amount to be paid by
                          Buyer to Seller shall be paid by wire transfer of same
                          day funds within two (2) business days after the
                          Closing Schedule shall have become final and binding
                          pursuant to Section 3.6(b)(ii) or (iii).

                          (iii) If the Working Capital as set forth on the final
             Closing Schedule is less than the Target Working Capital, then:

                                       (x) an amount equal to $200,000 plus such
                          deficiency, together with interest actually earned on
                          such sum, shall immediately be disbursed from the
                          Working Capital Escrow Amount to Buyer, and

                                       (y) the balance of the Working Capital
                          Escrow Amount, if any, shall immediately be disbursed
                          to Seller;

                          PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such deficiency exceeds
                          $200,000, (i) all of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
                          shall immediately be disbursed to Buyer, and (ii) an
                          amount equal to such deficiency less $200,000 shall be
                          paid by Seller to Buyer. Any amount to be paid by
                          Seller to Buyer shall be paid by wire transfer of same
                          day funds within two (2) business days after the
                          Closing Schedule shall have become final and binding

         3.7 CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Consent from a Governmental Authority, instrument, contract
(including the Assumed Contracts), lease, or other agreement or arrangement or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, to the
extent that such assignment or transfer or an attempt to make such an assignment
or transfer cannot be made pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
without the consent or approval of a third party. In the event any such consent
or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, in
any lawful arrangement, provide Buyer with the benefits under any such Consent,
instrument, contract, lease or other agreement or arrangement, PROVIDED that
Buyer shall undertake to pay, perform, discharge or satisfy the corresponding
liabilities and obligations for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent

                                   ARTICLE 4

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

         Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer
contemporaneously herewith (the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), of which the Schedules
referred to below are a part, and in the documents and other materials
identified in the Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that any matter disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any section of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to all other sections of this
Agreement), and subject to the limitations contained in Section 14.1, as of the
date of this Agreement, Seller makes to Buyer the following representations and
warranties.

         4.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING, ETC. OF SELLER. Seller is a corporation
duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction where
it is organized and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
the Business as currently conducted and to own or lease and to operate the
properties of the Business. Seller is in good standing and is qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which it conducts the Business and that
requires such qualification and where the failure to so qualify would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business. For the purposes of the Transaction
Documents, a "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS" means any material
adverse change in, or material adverse effect on, the assets, liabilities,
business or operations of the Transferred Assets or the Business taken as a
whole. Seller is currently a debtor-in-possession in the Bankruptcy Case
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, and retains full authority and power to operate
its business and affairs pursuant to Sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy
Code, with no trustee, examiner, facilitator or other officer or agent with
similar authority or powers to a trustee, examiner or facilitator having been
appointed in such Bankruptcy Case.

         4.2 CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy
Court, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other
documents executed or to be executed pursuant to this Agreement by Seller, and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller. Subject to approval by the
Bankruptcy Court, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer of Seller.

         4.3 ENFORCEABILITY. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

         4.4 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS AND CONSENTS. No consents, licenses,
approvals or authorizations of, or registrations or declarations with, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person are required to be obtained or made
by Seller in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, other than (a) bankruptcy court approval, and
(b) other consents, licenses, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
declarations, where the failure to obtain such would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Business.

                                      -11-

properties, assets, liabilities or business of the Business, except normal and
usual changes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

             (b) any material breach or material default by Seller or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, by any other party thereto, under any Assumed Contract or
obligation under a Assumed Contract included in the Transferred Assets or by
which Seller is bound;

             (c) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by
insurance) that has had a Material Adverse Effect on the Business;

             (d) any cancellation of any material indebtedness with respect to
the Business (individually or in the aggregate) or waiver of any claims or
rights of substantial value outside the ordinary course of business;

             (e) any sale, lease, license or other disposition of any assets
held by Seller or used in the Business, other than inventory sold in the

Major Customer or Major Supplier, which indirectly or in the aggregate has had a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business;

             (g) any notice received by Seller that any Major Customer intends

to materially reduce the sale of goods or services to Seller; or

             (h) any occurrence or occurrences, event or events, or condition or

Seller to conduct the Business in the manner presently conducted by Seller, and,

SCHEDULE 4.7, Seller has good and marketable title to all the Transferred
Assets, and pursuant to the Sale Order, Buyer shall receive good and marketable

leased by Seller under leases included in the Transferred Assets are in good
operating condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and are capable
of being used for their intended purpose in the Business as now conducted,
except where such condition or capability would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business. The Transferred Assets include all existing warranties and service
Contracts with respect to any of the Transferred Assets. All plants, structures,
equipment, vehicles and other tangible properties included in the Transferred
Assets, and the present use of all such items, conform to all Applicable Laws,
except where the failure to conform or such violation would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Business, and no notice of any violation of any Applicable Laws relating to
such assets or their use has been received by Seller. The Transferred Assets
include all easements, rights of ingress and egress, and utilities and services
necessary for the conduct of the Business except where the failure to possess
such easements, rights of ingress and egress and utilities and services would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.
Neither the whole nor any portion of any real property subject to leases
included in the Transferred Assets has been condemned or otherwise taken by any
public authority, nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, is any such condemnation or
taking threatened or planned.

Internet addresses, sites and domain names used or held for use in the Business

operation of the Business as now conducted by Seller does not require the use of

                          (vi) enter into any contract or obligation related to

                          (vii) make or agree to make any capital expenditure in
             excess of $25,000; or

             (c) In the event that Seller wishes to engage in any act which
falls within the provisions of Section 7.1(b), Seller shall provide notice

to such act.

         7.2 ACCESS. Subject to reasonable notice and as permitted by law,
Seller shall afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other agents and
representatives full access during normal business hours throughout the period

clarifications thereto, and a true, complete and correct summary of the terms
and conditions of each oral agreement, identified in the Disclosure Schedule. If
access is restricted due to a term in the agreement or by Applicable Law, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure consent from the other
party(ies) to the agreement to provide such access prior to Closing with
sufficient time for Buyer review. Buyer will treat the documents and other
material and information referred to in this Section 7.2 as confidential in
compliance with Section 9.10.

         7.3 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Seller shall give prompt notice to
Buyer of (i) any breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties at
any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, or (ii) any
failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy any of its covenants or conditions
in a timely manner under this Agreement. If Seller becomes aware of any event
requiring any change in the Disclosure Schedule, Seller will promptly deliver to
Buyer a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying such change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice or supplement to the Disclosure
Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Article 11.

maintenance or liquidation of the Excluded Assets. If Buyer receives payment in
respect of such items following the Closing, Buyer shall promptly pay such
amounts to Seller and shall notify promptly each such payor that any and all
payments by that payor to Seller in the future should be made directly to
Seller.

incorporating "American Architectural Products Corporation" or "AAPC" or any
similar Name and to all corporate symbols or logos (collectively, "LOGOS")

prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of
Transfer Taxes that are the primary responsibility of such party under
Applicable Law, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such party's preparation of any such Tax
Returns shall be subject to the other party's approval which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

             (b) The Transferred Assets are composed of (i) assets as to which
the "isolated, casual or occasional sale" exemption or similar exemption from
Transfer Taxes is or may be applicable and (ii) other assets as to which other
exemptions from Transfer Taxes are or may be applicable. In order to obtain any
exemption or favorable tax rate, Buyer shall, to the extent consistent with
Applicable Law, provide Seller with any exemption or resale certificate, permit,
license or such other documentation as may be required by any taxing authority
to establish the right to such exemption or tax rate.

         9.8 BOOKS AND RECORDS. Subject to the confidentiality provisions
hereof, Seller shall have the right to retain copies of the Books and Records.

             (a) Seller and Buyer shall provide each other and their Affiliates
with such assistance and documents, without charge and in a timely fashion, as
may be reasonably requested by either of them in connection with (i) the
preparation of any Tax Return, (ii) the conduct of any procedure relating to
Taxes, or (iii) any other matter that is the subject of this Agreement. Such
assistance shall include, without limitation: (x) the provision on demand of
books, records, Tax Returns, documentation or other information relating to any
relevant Tax Return ("TAX DATA"); (y) the execution of any document that may be
necessary or reasonably helpful in connection with the filing of any Tax Return,
or in connection with any procedure relating to Taxes, including, without
limitation, the extensions of applicable statutes of limitations; and (z) the
use of reasonable efforts to obtain any documentation from any Governmental
Authority or other Person that may be necessary or reasonably helpful in
connection with the foregoing. Such cooperation shall include, without
limitation, making their respective employees and independent auditors
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis for all reasonable purposes,
including, without limitation, to provide explanations and background
information and to permit the copying of books, records, schedules, workpapers,
notices, revenue agent reports, settlement or closing agreements and other

             (b) Seller and Buyer shall retain or cause to be retained the Tax
Data, the Tax Documentation, all Tax Returns, schedules and workpapers, and all
material records or other documents relating thereto, until one year after the
Closing Date or until the expiration of any additional period that either Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, may reasonably request in writing with respect to
specifically designated material records or documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in the event a party notifies the other party that an audit, examination,
investigation or other proceeding has been instituted prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Tax Data and Tax Documentation relating
thereto shall be retained until there is a final determination thereof (and the
time for any appeal has expired). After the expiration of the time when the Tax
Data and the Tax Documentation must be retained pursuant to this Section 9.89,
then any such material may be destroyed. Seller shall give Buyer not less than
thirty (30) days' prior written notice before Tax Data or Tax Documentation, in
the possession or control of any member of the consolidated group of which AAPC
is the common parent, is destroyed and shall give Buyer an opportunity to copy
any such material during such thirty (30) day period.

and Seller will maintain in confidence, and will cause their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors to maintain in
confidence, and not use to the detriment of another party any written, oral, or
other information obtained in confidence from another party in connection with
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, unless (i) such information is
already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of confidentiality
or such information becomes publicly available through no fault of such party,
(ii) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any
filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions (including, without limitation, Bankruptcy Court
approval of any of the Contemplated Transactions), or (iii) the furnishing or
use of such information is required by legal proceedings, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the party required to disclose the confidential information shall first
notify the other party of such order and afford the other party the opportunity
to seek a protective order relating to such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be under any restrictions with respect
to disclosures to the Committee, the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Case or
any prospective purchaser of the Business (and their respective agents and
representatives) (provided that any such prospective purchaser enters into a
confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to the Prior
Confidentiality Agreement). Buyer acknowledges that Seller will file this
Agreement with the Bankruptcy Court in furtherance of obtaining the Sale Order
or other appropriate relief from the Bankruptcy Court.

             (b) If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each
party will immediately return or destroy all such confidential information and
any and all copies thereof, however stored, and, if requested by the other
party, shall certify conformity with this Section 9.9(b) in writing.

             (c) The provisions of this Article 9.10 are in addition to, and not
in lieu of, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated March 15,
2002, between Buyer and Seller related to the Contemplated Transactions (the
"PRIOR CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). From and after the Closing Date, the Prior
Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no further force or effect.

culmination of an extensive process undertaken by Seller to identify and
negotiate a transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay the highest and
best purchase price for the Transferred Assets while assuming or otherwise
satisfying certain liabilities in order to maximize the value of those assets.
Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "BIDDING Procedures") to be
employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the sale of the Transferred
Assets to Buyer (the "SALE"). The Sale is subject to competitive bidding only as
set forth herein and approval by the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing under
Sections 105, 363, and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The following overbid
provisions and related bid protections are designed to compensate Buyer for its
efforts and agreements to date and to facilitate a full and fair process
designed to maximize the value of the Transferred Assets for the benefit of
Seller's creditors and stakeholders.

             (a) BID DEADLINE. All Bids must be submitted to Seller, c/o

will immediately distribute by facsimile transmission, personal delivery or
reliable overnight courier service in accordance with the notice procedures set
forth in Section 16.2 a copy of each Bid upon receipt to (i) counsel to the
Committee and (ii) counsel to Buyer. For purposes of this Agreement, "BID" shall
mean a letter from a Person who the Board of Directors of Seller has determined
in the exercise of its fiduciary duty is financially able to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (a "QUALIFIED BIDDER") stating that (A) such Qualified
Bidder offers to purchase the Transferred Assets upon the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, together with all Schedules and Exhibits hereto
(the "DEFINITIVE SALE DOCUMENTATION"), marked to show those amendments and
modifications to the Definitive Sale Documentation, including, but not limited
to, price and the time of closing, that such Qualified Bidder proposes, (B) such
Qualified Bidder is prepared to enter into and consummate the Contemplated
Transactions within not more than eleven (11) days after approval by the
Bankruptcy Court of a sale order, subject to receipt of any Consents of
Governmental Authorities (which must be obtained within sixty (60) days of the
approval by the Bankruptcy Court of a sale order), and (C) such Qualified
Bidder's offer is irrevocable until the closing of a purchase of the Transferred

             (b) QUALIFIED BID. Only Qualified Bids will qualify for
consideration at the Auction. For purposes of this Agreement, a "QUALIFIED BID"
is a Bid that:

                          (i) complies in all respects with Section 10.2(a);

                          (ii) has a cash component of at least an amount
             sufficient to pay a Break-Up Fee to Buyer in accordance with
             Section 10.2(d) and provides for payment, in full, of such Break-Up
             Fee directly to Buyer at closing;

                          (iii) is a proposal that Seller determines, after
             consultation with the independent financial advisor of Seller and
             the Committee, is under all circumstances, on balance, a higher and
             better Bid and has a value greater than or equal to the sum of (x)
             the value, as reasonably determined by the independent financial
             advisor of Seller, of Buyer's offer plus (y) the amount of the
             Break-Up Fee payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 10.2(d) plus (z)
             $200,000 over the preceding Qualified Bid;

                          (iv) is substantially on the same or better terms and
             conditions as those set forth in the Definitive Sale Documentation;

                          (v) is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
             committed financing or other ability to perform; and

                          (vi) is accompanied by a deposit (by means of a
             certified bank check from a U.S. bank or by wire transfer) equal to
             the Deposit. Such deposit shall either be returned to the Qualified
             Bidder in the event the Qualified Bidder's Bid is not determined to
             be the best Qualified Bid, or retained by Seller at the closing for
             the sale of the Transferred Assets and applied toward the Purchase
             Price.

             If Seller does not receive any Qualified Bids, no Auction will be
conducted, Seller will report the same to the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed
with a sale and assignment of the Transferred Assets to Buyer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. This Agreement executed by Buyer shall constitute a
Qualified Bid for all purposes.

             (c) AUCTION, BIDDING INCREMENTS, AND BIDS REMAINING OPEN.

                          (i) If Seller receives a Qualified Bid, Seller will
             conduct an auction (the "Auction") at the location designated by
             Seller at least 3 business days prior to the Auction, on the date
             that is one (1) business day prior to the date scheduled by the
             Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, beginning at 11:00 a.m.,
             prevailing Eastern time, or such later time or other place as
             Seller shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted
             Qualified Bids. Only Buyer, its representatives, Seller,
             representatives of the Committee, and a representative from the
             U.S. Trustee's office (via telephone conference) and any Qualified
             Bidders who have timely submitted Qualified Bids and their
             respective counsel shall be entitled to attend the Auction, and
             only Buyer and Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any
             subsequent Qualified Bids at the Auction. The opening bid, which
             does not need to be re-submitted at the Auction, is the highest
             Qualified Bid submitted


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

             before the Auction by a Qualified Bidder (the "OPENING BID"), which
             must include (A) the Break-up Fee and (B) an incremental increase
             in the Purchase Price of not less than $200,000 (the "OVERBID
             INCREMENT"). Bidding at the Auction will continue until such time
             as the highest and best Qualified Bid is determined. Seller may
             announce at or prior to the Auction additional procedural rules
             that are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., the amount of
             time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for conducting the
             Auction so long as such rules are not inconsistent with these
             Bidding Procedures.

                          (ii) After the Opening Bid, all subsequent bids must
             exceed the previous bid by not less than the Overbid Increment. Any
             bid by Buyer over the Opening Bid must be in an amount not less
             than the last bid plus the Overbid Increment (giving Buyer non-cash
             credit for the Break-Up Fee). For the duration of the Auction, all
             bids by either a Qualified Bidder or Buyer shall include the
             Break-Up Fee. If Buyer is the successful bidder at the close of the
             Auction, Buyer's winning bid will be reduced by the Break-Up Fee.

                          (iii) At least one (1) business day prior to the
             Auction, Seller will give Buyer and all other Qualified Bidders a
             copy of the highest and best Qualified Bid received and copies of
             all other Qualified Bids. In addition, Seller will inform Buyer and
             each Qualified Bidder who has expressed its intention to
             participate in the Auction of the identity of all Qualified Bidders
             that may participate in the Auction.

             (d) BREAK-UP FEE; EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT.

                          (i) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller
             pursuant to Section 13.1(d) then Seller shall be obligated to pay
             to Buyer, a break-up fee (a "BREAK-UP FEE") of $250,000, in order
             to reimburse Buyer for its reasonable out-of pocket expenses in
             connection with due diligence and the negotiation and preparation
             of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the expense of
             accountants, consultants, and other experts, and the obtaining of
             related financing), and the value added by Buyer (A) in
             establishing a bid standard or minimum for other bidders, (B) in
             placing Seller's estate property in a sales configuration mode
             attracting other bidders to the Auction and (C) for serving, by its
             name and expressed interest, as a catalyst for other potential or
             actual bidders. If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant
             to Section 13.1(c)(i) solely as a result of the failure to satisfy
             the conditions set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.4 (except as it
             relates to 11.3), 11.7, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10 or 11.11 (unless such
             failure to satisfy Sections 11.2, 11.4, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9 or 11.10
             results from a failure of any condition set forth in Article 12),
             then Seller shall be obligated to pay to Buyer an amount equal to
             Buyer's reasonable out-of pocket expenses incurred in connection
             with due diligence and the negotiation and preparation of this
             Agreement (including, but not limited to, the expense of
             accountants, consultants, attorneys and other experts, and the
             obtaining of related financing) plus $50,000 ("Expense
             Reimbursement"), provided, however, that the Expense Reimbursement
             shall not exceed $250,000.

                          (ii) If a Break-Up Fee is owed pursuant to the
             provisions of this Section 10.2(d), it shall be allowed and paid as
             an administrative expense of Seller under Section 503(b)(1) of the
             Bankruptcy Code upon the termination of this Agreement.

the Contemplated Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
(the actual date on which this Agreement is terminated being referred to herein
as the "TERMINATION DATE"):

             (a) by Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred on or
before December 31, 2002 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"), unless such failure to close is
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply
fully with its obligations under this Agreement;

             (b) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller, subject to any
necessary Bankruptcy Court approval;

             (c) (i) by Buyer, if any condition in Article 11 has not been
satisfied or if satisfaction of any such condition is or becomes impossible as
of the Outside Date (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement), and Buyer has not waived such
conditions on or before the Outside Date; or

                 (ii) by Seller, if any condition in Article 12 has not been
satisfied or if satisfaction of any such condition is or becomes impossible as
of the Outside Date (other than through the failure of Seller to comply with
Seller's obligations under this Agreement), and Seller has not waived such
conditions on or before the Outside Date; or

             (d) by Buyer or Seller, if the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered
an order approving a Competing Bid, following the earlier to occur of the
following: (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Competing Bid; or (ii) 30 days after the sale hearing at which the Bankruptcy
Court entered the order approving such Competing Bid.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any termination by Seller shall be
made only upon consultation with the Committee.

         13.2 REMEDIES. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a)
Buyer's exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Seller Parties
prior to the Closing shall be its right to the Deposit as contemplated in
Section 3.3 and, if applicable, the Break-Up Fee or Expense Reimbursement as
contemplated by Section 10.2(d); provided, however, such amounts shall be due
and payable only under the terms and conditions described therein, and (b)
subject to Section 3.3, Seller's exclusive remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by Buyer (or against


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

any of Buyer's Affiliates in conjunction with this Agreement) prior to the
Closing shall be its right to the Deposit as contemplated in Section 3.3;
provided, however, such amount shall be due and payable only under the terms and
conditions described therein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions set forth in this Section 13.2 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         14.1 EXPIRATION OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS. The
representations and warranties set forth in Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement
shall terminate and expire, and shall cease to be of any force or effect, on the
Closing Date except with respect to any representations made in connection with
the calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment in which case the date the
Working Capital Adjustment is paid shall be the operative date of termination,
and all liability of the parties hereto with respect to such representations and
warranties shall thereupon be extinguished. Except as specifically provided for
in this Agreement, all covenants and agreements of the parties hereto set forth
shall continue in effect until such time as any such obligation has been
fulfilled or waived by the other party to this Agreement; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that
nothing in this sentence shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from
consummating a complete liquidation.

         14.2 DISCLAIMER OF PROJECTIONS, ETC. Seller makes no representation or
warranty to Buyer except as specifically made in this Agreement. In particular,
Seller makes no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to the contents
of Seller's descriptive materials and management presentations to Buyer or the
data room made available to Buyer, including the certainty or accuracy of any
financial projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of Seller to Buyer.
Buyer acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such projections and forecasts, (b) it is familiar with such uncertainties,
(c) it is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all such projections and forecasts so furnished to it,
and (d) it shall have no claim against Seller with respect thereto.

                                   ARTICLE 15

                             POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

         15.1 DELIVERY OF FUNDS AND OTHER ASSETS COLLECTED BY SELLER; POWER OF
ATTORNEY. Following the Closing, to the extent Seller receives any funds or
other assets in payment of accounts receivable, or in connection with any other
Transferred Assets, sold to Buyer pursuant hereto, Seller shall immediately
deliver such funds and assets to Buyer and take all steps necessary to vest
title to such funds and assets in Buyer. Seller hereby designates Buyer and its
officers as Seller's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, to execute or endorse for the benefit of Buyer any checks, notes
or other documents included in the Transferred Assets or received by Seller in
payment of or in substitution or exchange for any of the Transferred Assets.
Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the power of attorney set forth in
the preceding sentence is coupled with an interest, and further agrees to
execute and


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

deliver to Buyer from time to time any documents or instruments reasonably
requested by Buyer to evidence such power of attorney.

         15.2 CHANGE OF NAME OF SELLER. Immediately upon the occurrence of the
Closing, Seller shall cease using, and thereafter refrain from using, the name
"Binnings Building Products, Inc." and all derivatives thereof, and as soon as
possible after the Closing, Seller will take all actions necessary to change
Seller's corporate name to a name other than "Binnings Building Products, Inc."
or any derivation thereof.

         15.3 NON-SOLICITATION. Seller understands that Buyer shall be entitled
to protect and preserve the going concern value of the Business to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and that Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 15.3 and, therefore, for a
period of one year from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause each
of ita Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly solicit, recruit or hire any of
the Transferee Employees or encourage any of the Transferee Employees to leave
the Business.


                                   ARTICLE 16

                              AGREEMENT CONVENTIONS

to time after the Closing Date, upon reasonable request from the other party, to
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, as appropriate, such further acts, deeds,
assignments, transfers, conveyances, assumptions, and powers of attorney as may
reasonably be required for (a) the better assigning, transferring, granting,
conveying, assuming, assuring and confirming to such other party, or its
successors and assigns, of any of the assets, properties or liabilities to be
assigned to it, or (b) the reassignment or return to Seller of assets that may
have been inadvertently assigned, transferred or delivered to Buyer but should
not have been so assigned, transferred or delivered, in each case as provided in
the Transaction Documents.

         16.2 NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other
communications required or permitted to be given under the Transaction Documents
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered

receipt requested, postage prepaid, (c) sent by next-day or overnight mail or

mail, on the third business day after the mailing thereof, (iii) if by next-day
