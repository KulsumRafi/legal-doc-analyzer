Dear Sirs

                            Our Reference: CMSW10001
                  Re: USD Amortizing Interest Rate Swap/Option

The purpose of this document is to set forth the terms and conditions of the
transaction entered into between Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania ("CBPA") and
yourselves ("Counterparty") on the trade date specified below (the
"Transaction"). This document will constitute a "Confirmation" as referred to in
the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.

The definitions and provisions contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions, (the
"Definitions"), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. ("ISDA") are incorporated into this Confirmation. In the event
of any inconsistency between the Definitions and provisions and this
Confirmation, this Confirmation will govern.

This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between
Counterparty and CBPA as to the terms of the Transaction to which this
Confirmation relates. In addition, Counterparty and CBPA agree to use all
reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in
the form of the ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "ISDA
Form") published by the ISDA, with such modifications as Counterparty and CBPA
shall in good faith agree (the "Agreement"). Upon the execution by Counterparty
and CBPA of such Agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and
be subject to the Agreement. Until we execute and deliver that Agreement, this
Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each
a "Confirmation") confirming transactions (each a "Transaction") entered into
between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation), shall
supplement, form part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the ISDA
Form as if we had executed an agreement in such form (but without any Schedule)
on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us. For purposes
thereof, the Second Method and Loss shall apply. All provisions contained in the
Agreement shall govern this Confirmation except as expressly modified below. In
the event of any inconsistency between this Confirmation and either the ISDA
Form or the Agreement, this Confirmation will govern for the purpose of this
Transaction.

The terms of the particular Transaction to which this Confirmation relates which
is an Option on the Underlying Transaction referred to below are as follows:
