Pledgor to the Pledgee under the Note have been paid and performed in full.
Upon payment in full of all such obligations, this Agreement shall terminate
and the Pledgee shall surrender to the Pledgor the Pledged Shares which have
not theretofore been sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this Agreement,
together with any excess proceeds from any sale of the Pledged Shares which at

Pledged Shares, the Pledgor assents to any extension or postponement of the
time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or
release of collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person
primarily or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereof
and the settlement, compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such
manner and at such time or times as the Pledgee may deem advisable. The
Pledgee may exercise its rights with respect to the Pledged Shares without
resorting to and without regard to other collateral or sources for
reimbursement for liability. The Pledgee shall not be deemed to have waived
any of its rights upon or under any obligation of the Pledgor to the Pledgee or
with respect to the Pledged Shares unless such waiver is in writing and signed
by the Pledgee. No delay or omission on the part of the Pledgee in exercising
any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver
on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right
on any future occasion. All rights and remedies of the Pledgee with respect to
obligations of the Pledgor to the Pledgee or the Pledged Shares, whether
evidenced hereby or by any other instrument or document, shall be cumulative
and may be exercised separately or concurrently.

seal, as of the day, month and year first written above.
