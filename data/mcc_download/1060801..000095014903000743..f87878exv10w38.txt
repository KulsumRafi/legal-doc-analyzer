                  CONSIDERATION; CLOSING; CLOSING DELIVERABLES

        2.1 Sale of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Sellers hereby agree to sell to Buyer, through Buyer Sub, all of the
Shares held by Sellers, which Shares are listed on Schedule 2.1 and Buyer,
through Buyer Sub, hereby agrees to pay the Sellers a purchase price of Three
Hundred Sixty Million Yen (Yen360,000,000) in cash (the "INITIAL PURCHASE
PRICE"), subject to the adjustment set forth in Section 2.2 (such purchase price
after such adjustment shall be hereinafter referred to as the "PURCHASE PRICE")
according to each Seller's percentage ownership of the Shares, which percentages
and the corresponding number of Shares owned by each Seller are set forth on
Schedule 2.1.

        2.2 Purchase Price Adjustment.

                (a) Purchase Price Adjustment. The aggregate Purchase Price will
be adjusted, on a Yen for Yen basis, by the sum of the Equity Adjustment and the
Cash Adjustment, so that the Purchase Price will be increased if such sum is a
positive value and the Purchase Price will be decreased if such sum is a
negative value (the "PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT"), provided that in no event
shall the Purchase Price Adjustment exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Initial
Purchase Price. No adjustment shall be made unless (i) the absolute value of
Equity Adjustment is greater than 2% of the Estimated CPP Equity or (ii) the
absolute value of the Cash Adjustment is greater than 2% of the Estimated Cash
Balance. The "EQUITY ADJUSTMENT" will be equal to the difference between the
Closing CPP Equity and the Estimated CPP Equity. The "CASH ADJUSTMENT" will be
equal to the difference between the Closing Cash Balance and the Estimated Cash
Balance. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Purchase Price Adjustment shall not
take into account any decrease in the Closing Cash Balance resulting from the
payment of the Initial Purchase Price from any CPP account, if applicable.

                (b) Preparation and Delivery of Balance Sheets. The Estimated
CPP Equity and the Estimated Cash Balance shall be set forth on an unaudited
estimated balance sheet of CPP as of May 31, 2002 (the "ESTIMATED BALANCE
SHEET") which (i) shall be prepared in accordance with the Account Preparation
Rules, (ii) shall be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of CPP as of the
date of delivery and (iii) together with all related accounting work papers
shall be delivered by the Sellers to Buyer at least seven (7) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. The Parties shall cause the Chief Financial Officer
of CPP to prepare a balance sheet of CPP as of May 31, 2002 (the "UNAUDITED
CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") which (i) shall be prepared in accordance with the
Account Preparation Rules, (ii) shall be certified by the Chief Financial
Officer of CPP as of the date of delivery and (iii) together with all related
accounting work papers shall be delivered simultaneously to Chuo Aoyama Audit
Corporation, or such other independent accounting firm as is reasonably
acceptable to all the parties (the "AUDITOR") and the parties hereto no later
than June 15, 2002. The "CLOSING BALANCE SHEET", setting forth the Closing CPP
Equity and the Closing Cash Balance, shall be the Unaudited Closing Balance
Sheet, as approved in accordance with subsection (c) below and as audited by the
Auditor.

                (c) Disputes. The Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet shall be
subject to the review of and shall be satisfactory to Buyer. After its receipt
of the Unaudited Closing Balance

<PAGE>

Sheet, Buyer shall have one week in which to reject the Unaudited Closing
Balance Sheet by written notice to the Sellers. If Buyer does not reject the
Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet within this period it will be deemed approved.
If Buyer rejects the Unaudited Closing Balance, the parties will use their best
efforts to have the Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet revised to the satisfaction
of all parties. In the event that there is a dispute between Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, regarding the Unaudited Closing
Balance Sheet that cannot be resolved between the parties, each party shall
appoint an auditor to meet in an attempt to resolve such dispute. In the event
that such auditors are unable to resolve the dispute, they shall jointly appoint
a third neutral auditor which shall make a final determination with respect to
the subject of such dispute. On the resolution of any dispute in accordance with
this subsection (c), the Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed
approved.

                (d) Settlement of the Purchase Price Adjustment. The Price
Adjustment Amount shall be settled by the parties within five (5) Business Days
following the later of (i) the receipt by the parties of the audit report with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or (ii) the resolution of any dispute with
respect thereto in accordance with subsection (c) above. Payment shall be made
by wire transfer to a bank account, as designated by the applicable transferee,
of Buyer or each Seller, and in the case of the Sellers shall be made on a pro
rata basis in accordance with each Seller's respective percentage ownership of
the Shares as set forth on Schedule 2.1.

        2.3 Wire Instructions. Attached hereto as Exhibit C are the wire
transfer instructions prepared by each Seller designating the accounts to which

Platform Technology Development Division, which is using CPP Services at the
Effective Date, to continue to use the CPP Services, provided that quality and
functions of CPP Services remains equivalent to or better than the quality and
functions of the CPP Services as provided on the Effective Date.

        7.2 Non-Solicitation Covenants: Scope and Choice of Law. It is the
understanding of the parties that the scope of the covenants contained in this
ARTICLE 7, both as to time and area covered, are necessary to protect the rights
of Buyer and CPP and the goodwill that is a part of the CPP Business. It is the
intention of Buyer, MITSUI and NTTCOM that these covenants as set forth in
Section 7.1 be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent than
would be permitted under the law of Japan) in time, area, and degree of
participation as is permitted by the



                                       23
<PAGE>

law of that jurisdiction whose law is found to be applicable to any acts in
breach of these covenants. If any part of such covenant is held invalid, void or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness,
or unenforceability shall in no way render invalid, void, or unenforceable any
other part of such covenant or any separate covenants not declared invalid, void
or unenforceable; and this Agreement shall in such case be construed as if the
invalid, void, or unenforceable provisions were omitted.

        7.3 Non-Solicitation Covenants: Assignment by Buyer. Buyer, MITSUI and
NTTCOM agree that the covenants of MITSUI and NTTCOM set forth in this ARTICLE 7
may be assigned by Buyer to any Person to whom the CPP Business is transferred
by the sale or transfer of CPP's Shares, assets or otherwise, provided that, in
the event that such sale or transfer results in a change in control of CPP other
than through a change of control or reorganization of Buyer (or any successor),
the prior written consent of MITSUI and NTTCOM, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, shall be required to effect the assignment of such
covenants. It is the intention of Buyer, MITSUI and NTTCOM that these covenants
of each Seller shall inure to the benefit of any Person that may succeed to the
CPP Business (as acquired by Buyer under this Agreement) with the same force and
effect as if these covenants were made directly with such successor. To the
extent required by Japanese law, Buyer shall procure a written agreement from
such buyer, assignee, transferee or other acquiring entity in which said entity
agrees to be bound by the relevant terms and conditions of this Agreement.

        7.4 Non-Solicitation Covenants: Remedy for Breach. Buyer, MITSUI and
NTTCOM agree that, in the event of any breach of the covenants in Section 7.1 by
MITSUI or NTTCOM, such breaching Seller shall be liable to CPP for liquidated
damages which shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

                (i) CPP's May 2002 Monthly Gross Revenue (as defined below) for
each CPP Customer with respect to which the covenants set forth in Section 7.1
have been breached, multiplied by (ii) the number of months of the remaining
Non-solicitation Period from the first month in which CPP receives less than the
May 2002 Monthly Gross Revenue from such customer, multiplied by (iii) three
(3). For the purpose of this ARTICLE 7, the "MAY 2002 MONTHLY GROSS REVENUE"
shall mean the amount of gross revenue which CPP is entitled to receive from the
relevant customer in consideration of the provision of CPP Services during May
2002.

                                    ARTICLE 8

arising out of:

                (a) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or
warranty by Buyer (including Buyer Sub) contained herein, in any Collateral

<PAGE>

                (b) any breach by Buyer of any covenant, agreement or

        10.4 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

                (a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this ARTICLE 10 in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by any Person, firm, governmental authority
or corporation against the indemnified party (a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible
after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third-Party
Claim but no later than the applicable Survival Date. The indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five Business Days after the
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party, promptly upon receipt of notice of such Third-Party
Claim, will acknowledge its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party
therefor.

                (b) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this ARTICLE 10 in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by the indemnified party (a "DIRECT CLAIM"
and, together with a Third-Party Claim, a "Claim"), the indemnified party must
notify the indemnifying party in reasonable detail, of the Direct Claim as
promptly as reasonably possible after the indemnified party becomes aware of
such claim but no later than the applicable Survival Date. The indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five Business Days after the
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Direct Claim. If a Direct Claim is made, the indemnifying party, promptly upon
receipt of notice of such Direct Claim, will acknowledge its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party therefor.

                (c) In connection with any claim giving rise to indemnity
hereunder or resulting from or arising out of any claim by a Person who is not a
party, the indemnifying party at its sole cost and expense may, upon written
notice to the indemnified party, assume the defense of any such claim if the
indemnifying party acknowledges to the indemnified party in writing its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to all elements of
such claim, and thereafter diligently conducts the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall be
entitled to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the indemnifying
party in any such action and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel employed by the indemnified party shall be at their expense
unless counsel for the indemnified party shall have advised that it is
reasonably likely that the indemnified party may raise a defense or claim that
is inconsistent with any defense or claim available to the indemnifying party,
in which case such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying party.
In no event shall the indemnifying party consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement (or have any liability for losses with respect
thereto) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to all indemnified parties of a release from all
liability with respect to such claims.



                                       29
<PAGE>

                (d) If the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of
such claim within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the
indemnified party or does not thereafter diligently conduct such defense in a
manner acceptable to the indemnified party, the indemnified party may defend
against such claim in such manner as they may deem appropriate and at the sole
cost and expense of the indemnifying party.

        10.5 Limitations.

                (a) The right to indemnification or other remedy based on the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement will
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time whether before or after the
Effective Date or the Closing Date, with respect to, the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with any such representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

                (b) The foregoing indemnification provisions are in addition to,
and not in derogation of, any statutory or common law remedy any party may have
for breach of representation, warranty, or covenant.

                (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Seller
shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees or any other Seller
Indemnitees under this ARTICLE 10 to the extent that the aggregate of all
Indemnifiable Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees and the other Seller Indemnitees,
including all Indemnifiable Losses arising under ARTICLES 7 or 9, exceeds the
portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller (or, in the case of
MITSUI, by MITSUI, NEC and Mitsui U.S.A.) (with respect to each Seller, the
"SELLER'S INDEMNIFICATION Cap"); provided, however, that the Seller's
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of such
Seller (x) arising out of, relating to or resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by such Seller; (y) arising out of, relating to or resulting
from a breach of any of such Seller's representations, warranties or covenants
in ARTICLE 8 or Section 6.2; or (z) if the Transaction does not close.

                (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under this ARTICLE 10 to
the extent that the aggregate of all Indemnifiable Losses of the Seller
Indemnitees, including all Indemnifiable Losses arising under ARTICLE 9, exceeds
the Purchase Price (the "BUYER'S INDEMNIFICATION CAP"); provided, however, that
the Buyer's Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any Buyer indemnification
obligation (x) arising out of, relating to or resulting from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Buyer (including Buyer Sub); (y) arising out
of, relating to or resulting from a breach of any of Buyer's (including Buyer
Sub's) representations, warranties or covenants in Section 6.2; or (z) if the
Transaction does not close.

        10.6 No Contribution. Each Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees,
that he, she, it and they will not have and will not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of subrogation,
right of indemnity or other similar right or remedy



                                       30
<PAGE>

against CPP, with respect to any action or failure to act by CPP occurring on or
prior to the Closing or in connection with any actual or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement set forth in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 11

        11.1 Bases for Termination. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions abandoned

                (b) by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.5
shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by
Buyer;

                (c) by the Sellers if any of the conditions set forth in Section
2.6 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived
by the Sellers;

                (d) by Buyer or the Sellers if the Closing does not occur on or
prior to July 31, 2002;

provided, however, that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause (b),
(c) or (d) is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
or in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

        11.2 Notice of Termination, Return of Documents. In the event of
termination by the Sellers, on the one hand, or by Buyer, on the other, pursuant
to this ARTICLE 11, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party and the Transactions shall be terminated, without further action by any
party.

        11.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the

become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (a)
Section 6.2 (Confidential Information), (b) Section 6.6 (Expenses), (c) Section
6.2 (Publicity), and (d) this Section 11.3. Nothing in this ARTICLE 11 shall be
deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of

to compel specific performance by another party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 12

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

        12.1 Assignment. Except as set forth below or as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, this Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall
not be assignable or transferable by any of Buyer or the Sellers without the
prior written consent of each of the other



                                       31
<PAGE>

parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. To this end, to the extent
required by Japanese law, the relevant party shall procure a written agreement
from such assignee, transferee or other acquiring entity in which said entity
agrees to be bound by the relevant terms and conditions of this Agreement.

        12.2 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for Persons entitled to
indemnification under ARTICLE 10 hereof, this Agreement is for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto, and nothing herein express or implied shall give or be
construed to give to any Person or entity, other than the parties hereto, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder, including any right to enforce any
obligations of any party hereto.

effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by each party hereto.

        12.4 Waiver of Compliance. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to
the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party, granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

        12.5 Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted
to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or sent
by prepaid telex, cable or telecopy, or sent, postage prepaid, by registered,
