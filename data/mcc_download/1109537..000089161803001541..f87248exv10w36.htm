Borrower (and each guarantor and pledgor signing below) agrees
that, as of the date hereof, it has no defenses against the

Borrower (and each guarantor and pledgor signing below)
understands and agrees that in modifying the existing
Obligations, Bank is relying upon Borrower&#146;s
representations, warranties, and agreements, as set forth in the
Existing Loan Documents. Except as expressly modified pursuant
to this Loan Modification Agreement, the terms of the Existing
Loan Documents remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
Bank&#146;s agreement to modifications to the existing
Obligations pursuant to this Loan Modification Agreement in no
way shall obligate Bank to make any future modifications to the

constitute a satisfaction of the Obligations. It is the
intention of Bank and Borrower to retain as liable parties all
makers and endorsers of Existing Loan Documents, unless the
party is expressly released by Bank in writing. No maker,
endorser, or guarantor will be released by virtue of this Loan
Modification Agreement. The terms of this paragraph apply not
only to this Loan Modification Agreement, but also to all
subsequent loan modification agreements.
