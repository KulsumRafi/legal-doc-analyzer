            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrant Agreements shall each provide that
            the Warrants shall not be transferred for one year from February 14, 2003
            except the following Warrant transfers may be made prior to February 14, 2004:
            (i) transfers in connection with bona fide estate tax planning purposes; (ii)
            if the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock is $4.25 or greater
            prior to February 14, 2004, 212,500 Warrants may be transferred within three
            (3) days after such price is attained; or (iii) if the volume weighted average
            price of the Common Stock is $5.10 or greater prior to February 14, 2004, an
            additional 60,000 Warrants may be transferred within three (3) days after such
            price is attained. Any transfer of the Warrants also must comply with the
            provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
            including, without limitation, Rule 144. Employee and Millennium acknowledge
            and agree that because of contractual restrictions binding upon Millennium,
            Millennium is presently prohibited from granting to Employee piggy-back
            registration rights for the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants. If
            Millennium is permitted in the future to grant piggyback registration rights,
            it will grant them to Employee.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As further consideration for the parties entering
            into this Release and Millennium issuing the Warrants to Employee, Employee and
            Millennium hereby enter into a consulting arrangement ("Consulting

            referred to herein as "Consultant." The Consulting Arrangement shall be for a
            term of one (1) year from the Effective Date. At the request of Millennium,
            Consultant agrees to provide consulting services to Millennium on matters,
            topics and projects requested by Millennium. Such consulting services shall be
            provided on a reasonable basis by Consultant and not conflict with his
            scheduling requirements. Such consulting services shall include Millennium's
            financial reporting and SEC compliance, intellectual property, including issues
            or disputes relating to claims of persons or entities other than Millennium to
            any right or interest in such intellectual property. For his services as a
            consultant, Consultant shall provide the first 20 hours of service at no
            charge, the next 21 to 40

            hours at $175 per hour and all hours over 40 hours at $250 per hour, and
            Consultant shall be paid his expenses. Consultant shall provide an invoice on a
            monthly basis to Millennium for services rendered and expenses incurred.
            Consultant's invoice shall be paid by Millennium within thirty (30) days. For
            purposes of the Consulting Arrangement, the following shall apply: The
            relationship of Consultant to Millennium shall be that of an independent
            contractor. Consultant shall not be deemed to be an employee of Millennium.
            Consultant shall not be considered as having employee status for the purpose of
            any employee benefit plan applicable to Millennium's employees generally,
            payroll withholding taxes, or for any other purpose such as, but not limited
            to, worker's compensation, medical or life insurance, vacation, holiday pay,
            unemployment insurance and welfare or pension benefits. The benefits set forth
            in Section 2(b) of this Agreement are separate and are not related to or a part
            of the Consulting Arrangement. Consultant accepts exclusive liability for the
            payment of any and all payroll withholding taxes with respect to all
            compensation that arises out of the consulting services provided under the
            terms of this section of this Release. This section does not and shall not be
            construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties and any
            of them.

            consideration for this Release. The parties further agree that these amounts
            are greater than what Employee is entitled to receive from Millennium under
            Millennium's policies, and equal to the amount under Employee's prior
            employment agreement with Millennium dated September 6, 2000 ("Employee's
            Employment Contract") and applicable law. Employee acknowledges that neither
            this Release, nor payment of any consideration pursuant to this Release, shall
            be taken or construed to be an admission or concession of any kind with respect
            to alleged liability or alleged wrongdoing by Millennium. Millennium
            specifically disclaims any liability to Employee and Employee specifically
            admits that Millennium is not liable to him on any basis. Millennium will not
            challenge an application for unemployment compensation by Employee.

            the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of
            Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant
            Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a "Buy-In"),

            shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely
            complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if

            cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock
            with a market price on the date of exercise totaled $10,000, under clause (1)
            of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the
            Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating
            the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In.

            can satisfy its obligation to withhold or otherwise pay for employment, excise,

            indebtedness, (ii) any security (other than a distribution of Common Stock
            covered by the preceding paragraph), (iii) rights or warrants to subscribe for
            or purchase any security, or (iv) any other asset (in each case,
            "<B>Distributed Property</B>"), then, at the request of any Holder delivered on
            the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive
            such distribution, the Company will deliver to such Holder, within five Trading
            Days after such request (or, if later, on the effective date of such

            entitled to receive in respect of the Warrant Shares for which such Holder's
            Warrant could have been exercised immediately prior to such record date. If

            pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange
            their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (iv) the Company
            effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share
            exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or
            exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a
            "<B>Fundamental Transaction</B>"), then the Holder shall have the right
            thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind
            of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon
            the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately
            prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant
            Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the "<B>Alternate
            Consideration</B>"). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of
            the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
            Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in
            respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the
            Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in
            a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components
            of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice
            as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
            Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
            Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such
            Fundamental Transaction. At the Holder's option and request, any successor to
            the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall, either
            (i) issue to the Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant
            and consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right
            to purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon
            exercise thereof, or (ii) purchase the Warrant from the Holder for a purchase
            price, payable in cash within five Trading Days after such request (or, if
            later, on the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction), equal to the

            of such calculation, the market price of the Common Stock shall be the closing
            bid price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the
            public announcement of the Fundamental Transaction and the volatility factor
            shall be determined by reference to the 12 month average industry volatility
            measures. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental

            surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (c) and
            insuring that the Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly

            Exercise the Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in
            a manner required pursuant to Section 4(a), and if after such fifth Trading Day
            the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of
            Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant
            Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a "Buy-In"),
            then the Company shall (1) pay in cash to Holder the amount by which (x) the
            Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the
            shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by
            multiplying (A) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to
            deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue by (B) the

            shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely
            complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if
            the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to
            cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock
            with a market price on the date of exercise totaled $10,000, under clause (1)
            of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the
            Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating
            the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In.

            by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
            Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator

            five Trading Days after such request (or, if later, on the effective date of
            such distribution), the Distributed Property that such Holder would have been
            entitled to receive in respect of the Warrant Shares for which such Holder's
            Warrant could have been exercised immediately prior to such record date. If
            such Distributed Property is not delivered to a Holder pursuant to the
            preceding sentence, then upon any exercise of the Warrant that occurs after
            such record date, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the
            Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon such conversion, the Distributed
            Property that such Holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of
            such number of Warrant Shares had the Holder been the record holder of such

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i)
            the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into
            another Person, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all
            of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any tender
            offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed
            pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange
            their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (iv) the Company
            effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share
            exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or
            exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a
            "<B>Fundamental Transaction</B>"), then the Holder shall have the right
            thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind
            of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon
            the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately
            prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant
            Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the "<B>Alternate
            Consideration</B>"). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of
            the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
            Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in
            respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the
            Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in
            a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components
            of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice
            as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
            Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
            Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such
            Fundamental Transaction. At the Holder's option and request, any successor to
            the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall, either
            (i) issue to the Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant
            and consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right
            to purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon
            exercise thereof, or (ii) purchase the Warrant from the Holder for a purchase
            price, payable in cash within five Trading Days after such request (or, if
            later, on the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction), equal to the
            Black Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the
            date of the Fundamental Transaction as well as assumptions reasonably mutually
            acceptable to the Company and the Holder, provided that for purposes of such
            calculation, the market price of the Common Stock shall be the closing bid
            price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the public
            announcement of the Fundamental Transaction and the volatility factor shall be
            determined by reference to the 12 month average industry volatility measures.
