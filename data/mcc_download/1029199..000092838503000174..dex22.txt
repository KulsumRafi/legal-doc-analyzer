3.         EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

           3.1.1         provision or reserve (other than provision or reserve
                         for deferred Taxation) specifically in respect of that
                         liability was made in the 2002 Audited Accounts or to
                         the extent that such provision or reserve is
                         insufficient because of an increase in rates of
                         Taxation or any variation in the method of applying or
                         calculating the rate of Taxation on or after Completion
                         with retrospective effect;

           3.1.2         the amount of that liability arises or is increased as
                         a result only of any change in the law, any judicial
                         decision or published practice of a Tax Authority
                         occurring after Completion with retrospective effect;
                         or

           3.1.3         an amount in respect of that liability has been
                         recovered pursuant to the warranties and obligations
                         contained in the Agreement or any undertaking or
                         misrepresentation in respect of the same Liability to
                         Taxation or has already been recovered under this Deed.

           3.1.4         the Liability to Taxation was discharged on or before
                         Completion and such discharge was taken into account in
                         preparing the 2002 Audited Accounts;

           3.1.5         it would not have arisen but for a voluntary act,
                         transaction or omission of or suffered by the Company
                         or the Buyer or any successor in title of either of
                         them after Completion unless such act transaction or
                         omission occurs:-

                         (a)       pursuant to a legally binding obligation of
                                   the Company entered into prior to Completion;
                                   or

                         (b)       with the written approval of the Seller; or

                         (c)       in the ordinary course of business of the
                                   Company and for this purpose the following
                                   shall not be regarded as in the ordinary
                                   course of business:

                                   (i)    any diminution, cessation, transfer or
                                          change in the nature or conduct of any
                                          trade of the Company; or

                                   (ii)   any transaction other than on arm's
                                          length terms with any person who is a
                                          participator or an associate of a
                                          participator of the Company within
                                          ICTA section 417.

           3.1.6         it would not have arisen but for any change after
                         Completion in the bases upon which the accounts of the
                         Company are prepared and/or in the policies or practice
                         adopted in the preparation of such accounts or in the
                         accounting reference date of the Company other than:-

                         (a)       at the written request or with the written
                                   agreement of the Seller; or

                         (b)       if mandatory to comply with generally
                                   accepted accounting practice in the United
                                   Kingdom (other than such practice announced
                                   after Completion and with retrospective
                                   effect); or

           3.1.7         the Liability to Taxation to which it relates has been
                         discharged by someone other than the Buyer or the
                         Company, or the Company has otherwise been compensated
                         for it in either case at no cost to the Company or the
                         Buyer;

           3.1.8         it would not have arisen but for the fact that the
                         treatment of any assets or liabilities or of Taxation
                         attributable to timing differences in future

                         accounts of the Company is different from the treatment
                         in the 2002 Audited Accounts;

           3.1.9         such Liability to Taxation would not have arisen or
                         would have been reduced or eliminated but for the
                         failure or omission on the part of the Company or of
                         the Buyer to procure that the Company is to make any
                         claim, election, surrender or disclaimer or given any
                         notice or consent or do any other thing which was taken
                         into account in computing any provision or reserve for
                         Taxation in the 2002 Audited Accounts and which the
                         Seller has notified to the Buyer in writing within a
                         reasonable time to allow the Buyer to make such claim,
                         election, surrender or disclaimer and in any event on
                         or before the date which is ten Business Days before
                         such claim, election, surrender or disclaimer is
                         required to be made;

           3.1.10        the Liability to Taxation arises as a result of the
                         Buyer's or the Company's failure to comply with its
                         obligations in accordance with the provisions of clause
                         6 (Conduct of Claims);

           3.1.11        the Liability to Taxation would not have arisen but for
                         a failure by the Company to utilise a Relief arising in
                         respect of an Event occurring on or before Completion
                         other than:-

                         (a)       a Relief taken into account as an asset of
                                   the Company in computing the 2002 Audited
                                   Accounts or in computing (and so reducing or
                                   eliminating) any provision relating to
                                   Taxation which appears in the 2002 Audited
                                   Accounts if such Relief is available to be
                                   used or would have been available to be used
                                   but for the disclaimer by the Company of
                                   capital allowances available on or before
                                   Completion to the Company (save to the extent
                                   that the disclaimer of such allowances has
                                   been taken into account to reduce or
                                   eliminate any Liability to Taxation under
                                   this Deed pursuant to clause 3.1.15); or

                         (b)       the Trading Losses,

                         against any profit, gain or Taxation arising from the
                         matters which would but for this clause 3.1.11. have
                         given rise to a Liability to Taxation or would have
                         been available to be so used had it not been used
                         against any profit, gain or Taxation arising from a

           3.1.12        the Liability to Taxation arises as a result of any
                         action taken at the written request or with the written
                         approval of the Buyer;

           3.1.13        any Liability to Taxation is on account of interest,
                         penalty, surcharge or fine which arises by reason of
                         any failure or delay on the part of the Buyer or the
                         Company or any successor in title of any of them in

                         payment hereunder made by the Seller;

           3.1.14        the Liability to Taxation would not have arisen but for

                         disclaimer or the giving of any notice or consent or

                         capital allowances available to the Company before
                         Completion;

           3.1.16        the Liability to Taxation is increased or arises as a

                         Completion; or

           3.1.18        the Liability to Taxation arises in consequence of an
                         Event which has occurred since the 2002 Audited

                         exercised after Completion in consequence of a failure
                         by the Company or Buyer to properly operate PAYE or

                         that this clause 3.1.19 shall not apply to the exercise
                         of any option or award in respect of which the Seller
                         has not given timely notice of exercise to the Buyer;
                         or

           3.1.20        the Liability to Taxation arises in respect of income
                         tax and national insurance contributions for which the
                         Company is required to account to any Taxation
                         Authority as a result of the exercise before Completion

                         Completion to Ronald Delveno.

           3.1.21        the Liability to Taxation would not have arisen but for
                         the application of section 768 or section 768A ICTA
                         1988 in respect of an Event occurring on or after

           3.1.22        the Liability to Taxation is a D Liability which would
                         not otherwise have arisen but for the application of
                         the Trading Losses, if and to the extent that, the
                         Liability to Taxation arises or is increased as a
                         result of any case decided after Completion, increase
                         in rates of Taxation, or imposition of new Taxation
                         legislation, or any change in applicable law,
                         regulation or regulatory requirement, or Inland Revenue

                         of the specific matters in respect of which any such
                         claim is made shall have been given to the Seller no
                         later than the date which is six years and six months
                         after the Completion Date;

           3.2.2         the aggregate liability of the Seller for all claims

                         shall be deemed to exclude the amount of all costs,
                         expenses and other liabilities (together with any VAT
                         thereon) payable by it in connection with the

                         Where more than one claim arises out of the same facts
                         or circumstances all such claims shall be aggregated
                         together for the purposes of this clause 3.2.3.

3.3        No liability shall attach to the Seller for any claim under this Deed
           unless the aggregate amount of such claim, when taken together with
           the amount of all other claims under this Deed (excluding reasonable
           legal costs and any other costs and expenses incurred in ascertaining
           the existence or amount of such claims ("Relevant Costs"), exceeds
           (pounds)31,250 (the "Threshold") and if the aggregate amount of such
           claims shall exceed the Threshold the Seller shall be liable for the
           whole of such aggregate amount and not merely for the amount in
           excess of the Threshold.

           Agreement shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or
           withholdings whatsoever save only as may be required by law. If any
           such deductions or withholdings are required by law the payer shall
           pay such sum as will, after such deduction or withholding has been
           made, leave the amount which would have been received in the absence
           of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding.

4.2        In the event that any sum paid as a result of the obligations
           contained in this Deed or in the Agreement is or will be subject to
           Taxation the Seller shall pay such sum as will, after payment of the
           Taxation so charged, leave a sum equal to the amount that would
           otherwise be payable under any such obligation.

           which has arisen under this Deed in respect of a Liability to
           Taxation or pursuant to the Warranties relating to Taxation then:

           5.1.1         if the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be,

                         payment or credit shall be dealt with in accordance
                         with clause 5.2; or

                         Company shall take all appropriate steps to enforce
                         that entitlement (keeping the Seller fully informed of
                         the progress of any action taken) and any payment or
                         credit received shall be dealt with in accordance with

                         the Buyer or the Company in respect of the amount
                         received and less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
                         charges and expenses of recovery actually incurred;

           relevant for the purposes of this Deed, the Buyer shall as soon as is
           reasonable give written notice of the Tax Assessment to the Seller
           (and in any case within 10 Business Days) but so that the giving of
           such notice shall not be a condition precedent to the liability the
           Seller. Such notice shall where relevant specify any time limit for
           the Seller's response. If the Seller shall indemnify and secure the
           Company to the Buyer's reasonable satisfaction against all losses,
           costs, damages and expenses (including, without limitation, interest
           on overdue Taxation and any Taxation which has to be paid before a
           Tax Assessment

           can be appealed) which may be incurred, the Buyer shall, or shall
           procure that the Company shall, take such action and give such
           information and assistance in connection with the affairs of the
           Company as the Seller may reasonably and promptly by written notice
           to the Buyer request to resist, appeal or compromise the Tax
           Assessment.

6.2        The Buyer shall not be obliged to procure that the Company appeals
           against any Tax Assessment if, having given the Seller written notice
           of the receipt of that Tax Assessment in accordance with clause 6.1,
           it has not within ten Business Days of the giving of such notice
           received instructions in writing from the Seller, in accordance with
           clause 6.1, to make that appeal.

6.3        The Seller shall not be entitled to request that the Buyer takes or
           procures the taking of any action under this clause 6 if in respect
           of any Tax Assessment notified under clause 6.1 which involves either
           the Seller, or the Company whilst it was under the control of the
           Seller in the commission of acts or omissions which may constitute
           fraud or misfeasance.

6.4        For the avoidance of doubt the actions which the Seller may
           reasonably request under clause 6.1 shall include without limitation
           the Company applying to postpone (so far as legally possible) the
           payment of any Taxation or the application of Reliefs (arising in
           respect of an Event occurring on or before Completion other than a
           Relief taken into account as an asset of the Company in completing
           the 2002 Audited Accounts or in compiling any provision relating the
           Taxation which appears in the 2002 Audited Accounts and the Seller
           shall be entitled under clause 6.1 to request that it be allowed to
           take on or take over the conduct of all or any proceedings arising in
           connection with the Tax Assessment in question. The Buyer shall
           promptly, and shall procure that the Company shall provide such
           information and assistance as the Seller may reasonably require in
           connection with the preparation for and conduct of those proceedings.

                     material correspondence in connection with the Tax
                     Assessment in question and shall provide the Buyer with a
                     reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. The Seller shall
                     not unreasonably refuse to accept any such comments;

             approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

     6.5.4   the Seller shall keep the Buyer informed of proposed meetings or
             material telephone communications with any relevant third party and

             and the Buyer has given its consent in writing to such settlement
             or compromise (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
             delayed) but if such consent is refused the Seller's liability
             under the Tax Deed relative to that Taxation Assessment shall be
             limited to a maximum of the amount for which the Seller would have
             been liable if such consent had been forthcoming;

     6.5.6   the Seller shall not be entitled to resist any Taxation Assessment
             before any High Court or other equivalent appellate body in a
             jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom unless it has been advised
             by Tax Counsel at the expense of the Seller after disclosure of all
             relevant information and documents, that it is reasonable to resist
             the Tax Assessment in the manner proposed by the Seller.

6.6  In the event that the Seller has not requested in writing that it be
     allowed to take on or take over the conduct of all or any proceedings
     arising in connection with the Tax Assessment in question:-

     6.6.1   the Buyer shall, and shall procure that the Company shall, provide
             the Seller with copies of all material correspondence entered into
             and notes of any conversations or meetings with any Taxation
             Authority to the extent that such correspondence or notes relate to
             the Tax Assessment in question;

                     at liberty without reference to the Seller to admit,
                     compromise or otherwise deal with any Tax Assessment unless
                     the Seller serves a notice on the Buyer to the effect that
                     they consider that the Tax Assessment should no longer be
                     resisted.

6.7  The Buyer shall be obliged to apply any Relief arising in respect of an
     event occurring on or before Completion other than a Relief taken into
     account or an asset of the Company in the 2002 Audited Accounts or in
     computing any provision relating to Taxation which appears in the 2002
     Audited Accounts to discharge any Liability to Taxation under this Deed
     except to the extent that such application would itself give rise to a
     Liability to Taxation under this Deed which could not be discharged or
     relieved by the relevant Reliefs.

6.8  The Buyer shall not and shall procure that the Company shall not agree to
     the extension of any time limit for the making of enquiries into the
     Taxation affairs of the Company for periods ending on or prior to
     Completion other than with the express prior written consent of the Seller
     (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

9.   DUE DATE FOR PAYMENT

9.1  Subject to clauses 9.2 to 9.4, where a Liability to Taxation to which this
     Deed applies involves a liability of the Buyer or the Company to make a
     payment or increased payment of Taxation (including, without limitation,

     demand is made by the Buyer and the fifth Business Day prior to the date on
     which the Taxation in question is payable to the relevant Taxation
     Authority.

     which are five days before the date or dates when the Taxation which would
     have been saved but for the application of such Trading Losses in computing
     Profits or Taxation is due and payable to the relevant Taxation Authority
     (the "Trading Losses Due Date").

9.3  If the Trading Losses Due Date would have been deferred but for the
     disclaimer or election to reduce capital allowances available on or before
     Completion by the Company the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount
     claimed on or before the date

                                       22

     when the Taxation which would have been saved but for the application of
     the Trading Losses in computing Profits or Taxation would have been due and
     payable to the relevant Taxation Authority if such disclaimer or election
     had not been made.

9.4  The Buyer agrees to and to procure that the Company shall make such claims,
     elections, surrenders or disclaimers, or utilise such Reliefs arising in
     respect of an Event occurring after Completion in the normal course of
     prudent management of its tax affairs.

     Deed applies and in a case where any other amount is claimed by the Buyer
     under this Deed, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount or amounts
     claimed on or before the date which is five Business Days after demand is
     made by the Buyer to the Seller.

9.6  Any sums not paid by either party on the due date for payment of the same
     shall bear interest (which shall accrue from day to day after as well as
     before any judgment for the same) from the due date for payment at the rate
     per annum of the base rate of National Westminster Bank Plc applicable from
     time to time (or in the absence of such rate at such similar rate as the

     such sums, such interest to be compounded quarterly. Such interest shall be
     paid on the demand of the Buyer.

10.  OVERPROVISIONS AND SAVINGS

10.1 If the Buyer discovers or, if the Auditors shall give an opinion whether at
     the request of the Seller or otherwise:-

     10.1.1  that any provision for Taxation in the 2002 Audited Accounts may be
             an overprovision, as defined in clause 10.7 (an "Overprovision");

     10.1.2  that any Liability to Taxation in respect of which the Seller has
             made a payment under this Deed has given rise to a saving, as
             defined in clause 10.6 by the Company which would not otherwise
             have arisen (a "Saving");

     10.1.3  that the Company has received payment in respect of Taxation to
             which it was entitled where such entitlement was not shown as an
             asset in the 2002 Audited Accounts (a "Repayment").

     the Buyer shall give or shall procure that the Company gives full details
     to the Seller. If the parties cannot reach agreement as to the amount of
     the Overprovision or Repayment or the value of the Saving, the Buyer shall
     (at the Seller's request and expense) procure that the Auditors shall
     certify such amount or value and that the

                                       23

<PAGE>

       Seller is provided, on request, with such information as it reasonably
       requires to check the accuracy of the certificate.

10.2   If the Seller:

       10.2.1  shall have made a payment to the Buyer under this Deed (including
               for the avoidance of doubt a payment referred to in clause
               10.6.1(b) and 10.6.2(b)) then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller
               an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the liability in
               respect of which a payment was made and the amount or value
               Overprovision, Repayment or Saving;

       10.2.2  shall have made no payment to the Buyer under this Deed or the
               amount or value of the Overprovision, Repayment or Saving exceeds
               the amount of any such payment (an "Excess Saving") already made,
               the Buyer shall set such Overprovision, Repayment or Saving, or
               Excess Saving, off against future liabilities of the Seller
               arising under this Deed.

10.3   Any payment to be made by the Buyer under Clause 10.2 shall be made
       within 10 days of the Auditors' opinion being deemed to have been
       received by the Buyer in accordance with clause 13 (Notices).

10.5   If any party to this Deed shall disagree with the Auditor's opinion that
       party may refer the matter (with the consent not to be unreasonably
       withheld or delayed of the other parties) to a firm of independent
       chartered accountants which shall then provide an opinion as to the
       amount or value of the Overprovision, Repayment or Saving, if any, and
       such opinion shall be binding on the parties in the absence of manifest
       error; provided that if the parties hereto cannot agree on a firm to be
       appointed they shall refer the matter to the President for the time being
       of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales who shall
       nominate an independent firm whose opinion shall be binding on the
       parties in the absence of manifest error.

10.6   In clause 10.1.2 "Saving" means the reduction of any Liability to
       Taxation by virtue of the set-off against such liability or against any
       income, profits or gains of any Relief arising as a result of a Liability
       to Taxation in respect of which the Seller has made payment under this
       Deed or the Warranties or obtaining a Relief which would not otherwise
       have been available.

       10.6.1  If and to the extent that:-

               (a)   any expenditure by the Company or provision or reserve for
                     or on account of any matter has been treated as deductible
                     or allowable for Taxation purposes in computing any
                     provision,

                                       24

<PAGE>

                     reserve or allowances for Taxation in the 2002 Audited
                     Accounts; and

               (b)   the Seller has made a payment under this Deed because the
                     expenditure, provision or reserve or a part of it is not
                     deductible in respect of the accounting period in which it
                     was treated as deductible or available but is deductible or
                     available in another accounting period,

               the value to the Company of the deduction or allowance obtained
               in the relevant accounting period in respect of the expenditure,
               provision or reserve whether by way of a reduced Liability to
               Taxation, an amount available for surrender by way of Relief or
               otherwise is to be treated as a Saving; and

       10.6.2  If and to the extent that:-

               (a)   any income, profits or gains of the Company not received by
                     the Company are found to be subject to Taxation; and

               (b)   the Seller has made a payment under this Deed in respect of
                     such income, profits or gains; and

               (c)   the Company subsequently receives the income, profits or
                     gains and is not subject to Taxation

               the amount of Taxation which would otherwise have been payable in
               respect of the income, profits or gains is to be treated as a
               Saving.

10.7   In clause 10.1.1 an "Overprovision" exists if any provision for Taxation
       in the 2002 Audited Accounts is or proves to be overstated or excessive.

11     BUYER'S INDEMNITY

11.1   The Buyer covenants with the Seller to pay to the Seller an amount equal
       to any Taxation for which the Seller or any person connected with the
       Seller is made liable to pay by virtue of the operation of sections 767A,
       767AA and 767B of ICTA 1988 in circumstances where the taxpayer company
       (as referred to in section 767A(1) is the Company.

11.2   The covenant in sub-clause 11.1 shall not apply to a Liability to Tax to
       the extent that the Seller is liable to the Buyer under this deed and has
       not paid an amount to the Buyer equal to and in respect of that Liability
       to Tax and not apply to Taxation which has been recovered under section
       767B(2) of ICTA 1988 (and the Seller shall

                                       25

<PAGE>

       procure that no such recovery is sought to the extent that payment is
       made hereunder).

       adjustment in the Consideration.

       this Deed shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other

       before exercising any remedy or right under or in relation to this Deed

16         GUARANTEE

16.1       The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to
           the Buyer:

           16.1.1        to procure that the Seller and/or any other member of
                         the Retained Group duly and punctually performs and
                         discharges all its obligations (the "Obligations")
                         under this Tax Deed; and

           16.1.2        without prejudice to the generality of clause 16.1.1,
                         and as principal obligor, to guarantee the due and
                         punctual payment of any and all sums now and
                         subsequently payable (the "Sums Payable") by the Seller
                         and/or any other member of the Retained Group arising
                         out of or in connection with this Tax Deed when the

                         sums upon demand.

16.2       The obligations assumed by the Guarantor in clause 16.1 constitute a
           continuing security which shall not be capable of being determined by
           notice and shall remain in force until all of the obligations of the
           Seller under this Tax Deed have been fully performed and discharged
           and all the Sums Payable have been fully paid. Where any discharge
           (whether in respect of the obligations of the Seller or any security
           for those obligations or otherwise) is made in whole or in part, or
           any arrangement is made on the faith of any payment, security or
           other disposition, which is avoided, or must be restored, on
           insolvency, liquidation or otherwise (without limitation), the
           liability of the Guarantor under this clause 16 shall continue as if
           the discharge or arrangement had not occurred.

                         of the Obligations;

           16.3.2        any incapacity or lack of powers, authority or legal

                         Buyer, the Seller, the Guarantor or any other person by
                         another person;

           16.3.3        any of the Obligations being or becoming invalid,

           16.3.4        any time or indulgence given or agreed to be given, or
                         any composition or arrangement made or accepted in
                         respect of any of the Obligations;

           16.3.5        any postponement, discharge, reduction, non-provability
                         or other similar circumstance affecting any of the
                         Obligations and/or the Sums Payable resulting (a) from
                         the making of any composition or arrangement by the
                         Seller with its creditors or (b) from any insolvency,

                         law, regulation or order. In each such case (a) every
                         reference to the Obligations and the Sums Payable
                         shall, for the purposes of the liabilities of the

                         transferred to any other person, the provisions of
                         clauses 16.1 to 16.4 shall, in addition, be construed
                         as if the expression "Seller" included such other
                         person.

           16.3.7        any other act, event or omission which, but for this
                         provision, would or might operate to offer any legal or
                         equitable defence for or impair or discharge the
                         Guarantor's obligations under clauses 16.1 to 16.4 or

           16.1 to 16.4 without first taking any steps or proceedings against
           the Seller or any other member of the Retained Group.

           been fully performed and discharged and all the Sums Payable have
           been irrevocably been paid in full, the Guarantor shall not, after a
