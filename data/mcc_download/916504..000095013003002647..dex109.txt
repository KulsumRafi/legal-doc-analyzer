with the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and in
any amendments filed with respect thereto prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Filed SEC Reports") or (iii) for liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2002 that are not material
to the business conducted by RACI and its Subsidiaries and for borrowings made
in the ordinary course of business under the Existing Credit Agreement, RACI and
its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities or obligations that would be
required to be reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of
RACI and its consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in
a manner consistent with the financial statements and balance sheets contained

in each case free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens.

               (b)   Each lease (including any option to purchase contained
therein) pursuant to which RACI or its Subsidiary leases any Leased Real
Property (the "Leases") is in full force and effect and, to the knowledge of
RACI, is enforceable against the landlord which is party thereto in accordance
with its terms. There exists no material default or event of default (or any
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material default)
on the part of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries under any Leases. Neither RACI
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any

                                        7

<PAGE>

default under any lease by which RACI or any of its Subsidiaries leases the
Leased Real Property nor any other written termination notice with respect
thereto.

               (c)   RACI and its Subsidiaries have legal and beneficial
ownership of all of their respective tangible personal property and assets
included in the September 2002 Balance Sheet, except for properties and assets
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of the September
2002 Balance Sheet, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Liens. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, RACI and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all of
the properties and assets necessary for the conduct of their business as
currently conducted. Each such tangible asset has been maintained in accordance
with normal industry practice, is in good operating condition and repair
(subject to normal wear and tear) and is suitable for the purpose for which it

         3.9   Contracts.

         Each material contract (as defined in Rule 601(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act) of RACI and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Material Contracts") is a valid and binding agreement of
RACI or one of its Subsidiaries and is in full force and effect. Neither RACI
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of RACI, any other Person is
in default under any Material Contract, except for such defaults which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         3.10  Employment Matters, etc.

               (a)   ERISA. All Plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), currently maintained or contributed
to by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries (the "ERISA Plans") comply in all respects
with their terms and the requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), except for any failures to comply that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No ERISA Plan (other than a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) to which RACI or any member of the same controlled group
of corporations as RACI within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
contributes and that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; no material liability (other than for
annual premiums) to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has been incurred
by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such ERISA Plan; and to
the knowledge of RACI, no "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any ERISA Plan that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA that would reasonably be expected to result in the termination of
such ERISA Plan. None of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability for any tax or penalty

                                        8

<PAGE>

imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA, except for any
liabilities that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No ERISA Plan is a multiemployer
plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of RACI, threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the ERISA Plans
or by any employee involving any such plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), except for any claims that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
contributions required to have been made by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries to
any ERISA Plan or to any other employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA) under the terms of any such plan or pursuant to any
applicable collective bargaining agreement or Applicable Law (including ERISA
and the Code) have been timely made.

               (b)   Tax Qualification. Each ERISA Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code, and, to knowledge of RACI,
nothing has occurred since the date of such determination letter that will
adversely affect such qualification.

               (c)   Triggering Events. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions described in this Agreement by themselves will require a payment,
or cause acceleration of vesting of a right to payment, under any Material
Contract within the meaning of Rule 601(10)(iii) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Act. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of
additional acts or events) result in any payment under any Plan or employment
agreement that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of
Section 280G or 4999 of the Code.

         3.11  Intellectual Property.

               (a)   Except as would not individually or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, RACI or a Subsidiary
owns (the "Owned Intellectual Property"), free and clear of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens, or is licensed to use all trademarks, trade names, service
marks, copyrights and patents that are registered or subject to an application
for registration (collectively, "Intellectual Property") and necessary for the
conduct of the business of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries. RACI and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps in accordance with normal
industry practice to protect and maintain in force the Owned Intellectual
Property and to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets used in the
operation of the business. To RACI's knowledge, except for infringements,
claims, demands, proceedings and defects in rights that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
(x) the use of the

                                        9

<PAGE>

Owned Intellectual Property by RACI and its Subsidiaries as currently used does
not infringe on the Intellectual Property rights of any Person and (y) there is
no claim or demand of any Person or entity pertaining to, or any proceeding that
is pending or threatened that challenges the rights of RACI or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of, any Owned Intellectual Property.

               (b)   Neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to RACI's
knowledge, any other party thereto, is in default under any material written
licenses to Intellectual Property or trade secrets (other than licenses for
"off-the-shelf" software) to which RACI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
pursuant to which (x) RACI or such Subsidiary permits any Person to use any of
the Owned Intellectual Property or trade secrets owned by RACI or such
Subsidiary, or (y) any Person permits RACI or such Subsidiary to use any
Intellectual Property or trade secrets not owned by RACI or such Subsidiary that
are necessary for the conduct of the business of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries
as currently conducted (collectively, the "Licenses"). Each License is in full
force and effect as to RACI or any Subsidiary party thereto and, to RACI's
knowledge, as to each other party thereto, except for such defaults and failures
to be so in full force and effect as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         3.12  Governmental Authorizations; Compliance with Law.

         All of the licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations
necessary to conduct the business of RACI and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted have been duly obtained, are held by RACI or its Subsidiaries and are
in full force and effect, except in each case where such a failure would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of RACI or any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any violation of any law,
statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, decree, permit, concession,
franchise or other governmental authorization or approval applicable to it or to
any of its properties, except for violations which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. This
Section 3.12 does not relate to employee benefits matters which are instead the
subject of Section 3.10, tax matters which are instead the subject of Section
3.14 or environmental matters which are instead the subject of Section 3.16.

         3.13  Litigation.

         There are no judicial or administrative actions, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of RACI, threatened which (a)
individually or in the aggregate, have a reasonable likelihood of being
determined in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (b) question the validity of this Agreement or any action
taken or to be taken by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement.

         3.14  Taxes.

               (a)   Except as reflected or reserved against in the financial
statements included in the SEC Reports, (i) each Tax Return required to have
been filed by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries has been filed and is correct and
complete in all respects, (ii) all amounts shown as due on such Tax Returns have
been paid, and (iii) all employment and withholding Taxes required to be paid or
withheld by or on behalf of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid or
properly set aside in accounts for such purpose, except, in each case, for any
failure to file, be correct and complete, withhold, set aside or pay that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not pending
any audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of
Taxes payable by RACI or any of its Subsidiaries, which if determined in a
manner adverse to RACI would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. "Taxes" means all U.S. or non-U.S. federal, national, state or local
taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges in the nature of taxes,
including all income, franchise, withholding, unemployment insurance, social
security, sales, use, excise, real and personal property, stamp, transfer, VAT
and workers' compensation taxes, together with all interest, penalties and
additions payable with respect thereto. "Tax Return" means all returns and
reports required to be supplied to a taxing authority relating to Taxes.

               (b)   Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) none of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries is a
beneficiary of an extension of time within which to file any Tax Return that has
not yet been filed, (ii) none of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries has entered
into an agreement or waiver extending any statute of limitations relating to the
payment or collection of any material Taxes, (iii) no written claim has been
made by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where any of RACI or its
Subsidiaries has not filed Tax Returns that such entity is subject to Tax by
that jurisdiction, (iv) there are no security interests or liens on any of the
assets of any of RACI or its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any
failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax (other than inchoate liens for Taxes
not yet due), and (v) none of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries has made any
adjustments under Section 481 of the Code or similar adjustment under state or
local income Tax law that would give rise to Tax liability following the Closing
Date.

         3.15  Absence of Changes.

         Since September 30, 2002, other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:

the ordinary course in substantially the same manner in which it has been

               (b)   there has been no change in such business which
individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect;

               (c)   RACI has not declared, set aside or paid any dividend or
other distribution with respect to its capital stock or redeemed or repurchased
any of its capital stock, except for repurchases of shares of Common Stock,
Deferred Shares and cancellation of Options upon or following termination of
employment pursuant to the Management Agreements; and

               (d)   neither RACI nor its Subsidiaries have paid any fees to
their shareholders, directors or officers of RACI and its Subsidiaries or the
Affiliates of such Persons, except pursuant to the C&D Agreements, the
Management Agreements and remuneration and compensation to management
shareholders under customary employment arrangements in the ordinary course of
business, including director fees.

         3.16  Environmental Matters.

         Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

applicable Environmental Laws;

               (b)   RACI and its Subsidiaries have obtained, and are in
compliance with, all permits and authorizations required under applicable
Environmental Laws;

of any condition resulting from the release or threatened release of Hazardous
Substances;

               (f)   to RACI's knowledge, neither RACI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has manufactured, treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for or
permitted the disposal of, transported, handled or released any Hazardous
Substance in a manner that currently

                                       12

<PAGE>

gives rise to liabilities for environmental site investigation or cleanup, or
injuries to persons, property or natural resources under applicable
Environmental Laws; and

               (g)   to RACI's knowledge, there are no Hazardous Substances
present at any facility or property now owned, leased or operated by RACI or any
of its Subsidiaries that currently gives rise to liabilities for environmental
site investigation or clean-up, or injuries to persons, property or natural
resources, under applicable Environmental Laws.

         Notwithstanding any of the representations and warranties contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, environmental matters shall be governed exclusively
by this Section 3.16.

         3.17  Affiliate Transactions.

         Neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
with any shareholder, director or officer of RACI or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Affiliate of such Persons, except for the C&D Agreements, the Management
Agreements and customary employment arrangements.

         3.18  Brokers.

         All negotiations relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby have been carried out without the intervention of any Person
acting on behalf of RACI in such manner as to give rise to any valid claim
against the Investor, C&D Fund IV, RACI or RACI's Subsidiaries for any brokerage
or finder's commission, fee or similar compensation, including under the C&D
Consulting Agreement.

                                       15

<PAGE>

         RACI and each of its Subsidiaries will give the Investor and its
representatives reasonable access to the properties, books and records and key
personnel of RACI and its Subsidiaries and will furnish such information and

IV, unless required by Applicable Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case the Investor, RACI or C&D Fund IV, as the case may be, will have the
right to review such press release or announcement prior to publication. None of
RACI and it Subsidiaries will use the name of the Investor in any press release
or other publicly disclosed document without the prior approval of the Investor,
unless required by Applicable Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case the Investor will have the right to review such document.

         5.4   Conduct of Business, etc.

         From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, except as provided
for in this Agreement (including Section 5.5) or as otherwise consented to by
the Investor in writing, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld:

               (a)   RACI will and will cause and each of its Subsidiaries to
conduct its business in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner in
which it previously has been conducted;

               (b)   RACI will not declare, set aside or pay any dividend or
other distribution with respect to its capital stock or redeem or repurchase any
of its capital stock, except for repurchases of shares of Common Stock, Deferred
Shares and Options upon or following termination of employment pursuant to the
Management Agreements;

               (c)   neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries will issue any
shares of any class of its capital stock or other ownership interest, any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares or interest or
any profit participation interest, other than

                                       16

<PAGE>

upon exercise of any outstanding Options, in respect of outstanding Deferred
Shares, pursuant to the Election Forms or relating to normal cash bonuses under
annual bonus plans;

               (d)   neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries will pay, grant or
commit to grant any material increase in any remuneration of any shareholder,
director or member of senior management of the Company;

               (e)   neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into
any transactions with any shareholder, director or officer of RACI or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of such Persons; and

               (f)   neither RACI nor any of its Subsidiaries will pay Clayton,
Dubilier & Rice, Inc. a deal fee or any other similar transaction fee under the
C&D Consulting Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

         5.5   Certain Transactions.

               (a)   Subject to the approval of the Repurchase by the board of
directors of RACI, RACI will offer to repurchase (the "Repurchase") such number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock at the Purchase Share Price such that
immediately following the Repurchase, after giving effect to the Investment and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Additional
Investment), the total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (assuming a
per share value equal to the Purchase Share Price) plus the initial aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding RACI B Senior Notes (as defined below) will
have an aggregate value of no greater than $62.5 million, and C&D Fund IV will
own no more than 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The
consideration used to effect the Repurchase will consist of cash, senior notes
with an aggregate principal amount of up to $20 million, with terms no more
favorable to the holder than those set forth in Exhibit A-1 (each, a "RACI A
Senior Note"), and, if necessary, additional senior notes with terms no more
favorable to the holder than those set forth in Exhibit A-2 (each, a "RACI B
Senior Note"). RACI will effect the Repurchase through either a merger of a
newly formed corporation into RACI, with RACI as the surviving entity, or an
offer to repurchase shares of Common Stock by RACI. The Investor will take such
actions as RACI may reasonably request to effect the Repurchase by merger,
including making the Investment in a newly formed corporation to be merged into
RACI, provided that the organizational and other documents required to effect
the Repurchase and the Investment through a merger will be reasonably acceptable
to the Investor.

               (b)   In the event that RACI effects the Repurchase through an
offer to repurchase shares of Common Stock, C&D Fund IV will tender to such
offer such amount of shares of Common Stock and take such other actions as
reasonably necessary

                                       17

<PAGE>

such that, following the consummation of the Repurchase and after giving effect
to the Investment, C&D Fund IV will own no more than 49% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock.

               (c)   RACI will offer (the "Offer") to repurchase from each
holder of Common Stock (other than C&D Fund IV) (each an "Other Shareholder") a
percentage of such Other Shareholder's shares of Common Stock equal to the
percentage of C&D Fund IV's shares of Common Stock that RACI will repurchase
from C&D Fund IV pursuant to this Section 5.5. Such repurchase from each Other
Shareholder will be on the same terms and at the Purchase Share Price and will
be paid either entirely in cash or in the same proportion of cash and notes as
the repurchase from C&D Fund IV, at the option of such Other Shareholder. In the
event any of the Other Shareholders elects to receive payments entirely in cash,
the principal amount of the RACI A Senior Note and RACI B Senior Note, if any,
to be issued to C&D Fund IV and the Other Shareholders electing to receive a
portion of their consideration in notes pursuant to the Repurchase will be
increased accordingly, and the cash consideration to be paid to C&D Fund IV and
such Other Shareholders will be decreased accordingly.

               (d)   If the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
results in a "change in control" as defined in the Remington Stock Plans,
immediately prior to the Closing, shares of Common Stock in respect of the
Deferred Shares will be distributed to each holder of Deferred Shares (each, a
"Deferred Shareholder"), such Deferred Shares will be extinguished and such
holders will be entitled to participate in the Offer, except to the extent that
such Deferred Shareholder gives written notice to RACI before December 31, 2002
of an election to continue to defer all or a portion of such Deferred Shares. In
the event a Deferred Shareholder elects to continue to defer all or a portion of
the Deferred Shares, the payments to such holder and reductions to his or her
Deferred Share account will be adjusted accordingly. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby does not
result in a "change in control" as defined in the Remington Stock Plans, then
the shares of Common Stock in respect of the Deferred Shares will not be
distributed to the Deferred Shareholders and RACI will instead (A) pay to each
Deferred Shareholder an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
Deferred Shares held by such Deferred Shareholder multiplied by the percentage
of C&D Fund IV's shares of Common Stock that RACI will repurchase from C&D Fund
IV pursuant to Section 5.5(a) (the "Number") and (ii) the Purchase Share Price
and (B) adjust such Deferred Shareholder's Deferred Share account to reduce the
number of Deferred Shares held by such Deferred Shareholder by the Number,
unless such Deferred Shareholder gives written notice to RACI before December
31, 2002 of an election to continue to hold all or a portion of such Deferred

               (e)   If the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
results in a "change in control" as defined in the Remington Stock Plans,
immediately prior to the Closing, RACI will cancel all outstanding Options,
whether or not vested, in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Purchase Share Price over (ii) the exercise price of the Options
cancelled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby does not result in a "change in control" as
defined in the Remington Stock Plans, then the outstanding Options will not be
canceled in exchange for a cash payment and RACI will instead offer to make a
cash payment in cancellation of any vested Options in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of vested Options that such holder chooses to have
cancelled and (y) the excess of (A) the Purchase Share Price over (B) the
exercise price for the Options repurchased from such holder. Any vested Option
not surrendered for cancellation pursuant to the foregoing sentence will remain
outstanding in accordance with its terms.

               (f)   RACI may issue additional shares of Common Stock to certain
employees, managers and directors of the Company for an aggregate purchase price
of up to $6 million at a price per share equal to the Purchase Share Price (the
"Additional Investment").

               (g)   The parties intend that the Repurchase of C&D Fund IV's
Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement will be treated as "substantially
disproportionate" within the meaning of Section 302(b)(2) of the Code. The
parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Repurchase to be so
treated, including (in the case of the Investor) providing to C&D Fund IV such
information regarding its beneficial ownership and capital structure and such
assistance as may be reasonably requested in order to permit C&D Fund IV to
determine whether the Repurchase satisfies the requirements of Sections
302(b)(2) and 318 of the Code. C&D Fund IV agrees that it will not disclose any
information provided to it by the Investor pursuant to this Section 5.5(e)
without the consent of the Investor, other than (i) to C&D Fund IV's Affiliates
and their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors, and then only on
a confidential basis or (ii) as requested or required by any taxing authority.

               (h)   Subject to the first sentence of Section 5.5(a), at the
closing of the Repurchase, the principal amount of the RACI Senior A Notes and
RACI Senior B Notes issued to, and the number of shares of Common Stock
repurchased from, C&D Fund IV (and, to the extent required by the Registration
and Participation Agreement, the Other Shareholders) shall, if necessary, be
adjusted upward so as to ensure that, after consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, C&D Fund IV will own no more than 49% of the outstanding
Common Stock (determined by taking into account the rules of Sections 302(c) and
318 of the Code).

their respective Affiliates, representatives and agents in respect of the
subject matter hereof.

         8.4   Certain Limitations.

         It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties that
no party nor any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied,
other than those set forth in Articles II, III and IV and none of the parties is
relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express
or implied, made by the other party or such other party's Affiliates,
representatives or agents, except for the representations and warranties set
forth in such sections. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION
AS TO CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE
BUSINESS. The parties agree that this is an arm's length transaction in which
the parties' undertakings and obligations are limited to the performance of
their obligations under this Agreement. The Investor acknowledges that it is a
sophisticated investor, that it has undertaken a full investigation of the
Company, and that it has only a contractual relationship with RACI, based solely
on the terms of this Agreement, and that there is no special relationship of
trust or reliance between the Investor and RACI.

         8.5   Termination.

               (a)   This Agreement may be terminated:

               (i)   at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual consent of
         the Investor, RACI and C&D Fund IV;

                                       30

<PAGE>

               (ii)  by the Investor or RACI, if the Closing has not taken place
         on or before February 28, 2003 or such later date as the parties may
         agree to in writing;

               (iii) by either the Investor or RACI by written notice to the
         other party if any event, fact or condition occurs or exists that
         otherwise makes it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the
         terminating party's obligations to consummate the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, and such event, fact or condition is
         not cured or waived by the non-terminating party within 30 days, unless
         the occurrence or existence of such event, fact or condition is due to
         the failure of the terminating party to perform or comply with any of
         the agreements or covenants of this Agreement to be performed or
         complied with by such party prior to the Closing; or

               (iv)  by either the Investor or RACI if the Repurchase has not
         been duly authorized by the board of directors of RACI on or before
         January 31, 2003.

               (b)   In the event of termination by RACI or the Investor
pursuant to this Section 8.5, RACI or the Investor, as applicable, will give
written notice forthwith to the other party and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will be terminated without further action by either party. If the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided in this
Section 8.5:

               (1)   The Investor will return to RACI all documents and other
         materials received from RACI, its Affiliates or its agents (including
         all copies of or materials developed from any such documents or other
         materials) relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
         obtained before or after the execution hereof, or certify to RACI as to
         their destruction.

               (2)   All confidential information received by the Investor with
         respect to RACI and its Affiliates or its agents shall be treated in
         accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement which will remain in full
         force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

               (3)   If this Agreement is terminated as provided in this Section
         8.5, this Agreement will become null and void and of no further force
         or effect, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 5.3
         relating to publicity, and Section 8.6 relating to certain expenses.
         Nothing in this Section 8.5 will be deemed to release either party from
         any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions
         of this Agreement or to impair the right of either party to compel
         specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this
         Agreement.

                                (d) any increase or decrease in the number of
                                    directors of the boards of directors of RACI

                                (e) any transaction between RACI or its
                                    Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
                                    shareholder, director or officer of RACI or
                                    any of its Subsidiaries or affiliate of any
                                    such Persons, on the other hand, having a
                                    value in excess of $500,000, other than
                                    customary transactions with any management
                                    shareholders in connection with customary
                                    employment arrangements; and

                                (f) any termination or amendment of the C&D

                                Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
                                repayment in full of the RACI A Senior Notes and
                                the RACI B Senior Notes:

                                (a) a Sale of the Company will not require the
                                    prior written approval of C&D Fund IV;
                                    instead, C&D Fund IV, or any of its
                                    Affiliates, will have a right of first offer
                                    on customary terms to purchase RACI

                                    or Remington, as the case may be, provided,
                                    that if neither C&D Fund IV nor any of its
                                    Affiliates exercise such right of first
                                    offer, C&D Fund IV and its Affiliates shall
                                    (i) consent to, vote for, participate in (on
                                    the same terms and conditions as the
                                    Investor) and raise no objection against a
                                    Sale of the Company, and (ii) exercise any
                                    "drag-along" right or other similar right
                                    granted to C&D Fund IV and/or its Affiliates
                                    with respect to the capital stock, stock

                                    its Subsidiaries; and

                                (b) the appointment and termination of the Chief
                                    Executive Officer of RACI and Remington will
                                    not require the prior written approval of
                                    C&D Fund IV; instead, such appointment and
                                    termination will require the affirmative
                                    vote of at least 73% of all directors then
                                    in office.

Transfer Restrictions:          No transfer of shares other than in accordance
                                with the transfer restrictions contained in the
                                Shareholders Agreement and applicable securities
                                laws.

Permitted Transfers             Each party may transfer to any of its affiliates
                                so long as such transferee agrees to be bound by
                                the Shareholders Agreement. Each of the Investor
                                and C&D Fund IV may distribute its shares of
                                Common Stock to its partners and thereafter, to
                                the partners and former partners of its general
                                partner, which shares will be subject to the
                                Shareholders Agreement and each transferee will
                                be deemed to have granted an irrevocable power
                                of attorney to the Investor's or C&D Fund IV's
                                general partner, as applicable, granting it the
                                power to vote and to dispose of such shares in
                                its sole discretion and to take any other action
                                contemplated by the Shareholders Agreement.

Tag-Along Rights:               Each party will have tag-along rights, on
                                customary terms, in the event of a transfer by
                                C&D Fund IV or the Investor of all or any
                                portion of its shares of Common Stock to any
                                person other than an affiliate of

                                the transferor.

Right of First Offer:           Each of C&D Fund IV and the Investor will have a
                                right of first offer on customary terms over any
                                proposal to sell any shares of Common Stock by
                                the other to any person other than an affiliate
                                of the transferor. Any third party purchaser of
                                Common Stock following a waiver of a right of
                                first offer will be required to agree to be
                                bound by the Shareholders Agreement.

Pre-emptive Rights:             No shareholder will have pre-emptive rights,
                                except that each of C&D Fund IV and the Investor
                                shall have preemptive rights with respect to any
                                issuance of shares of capital stock or
                                securities convertible into shares of capital
                                stock of RACI or its Subsidiaries to any person,
                                except pursuant to the existing management stock
                                option plan or any other management stock option
                                plan approved by the board of directors of RACI.

Registration Rights:            Each party will be entitled to the rights and
                                subject to the obligations set forth in the
                                Registration and Participation Agreement, dated
                                as of November 30, 1993, which will be amended
                                and restated in its entirety at the Closing. The
                                shares of Common Stock issued to the Investor
                                will constitute "Registrable Securities". The
                                Amended and Restated Registration and
                                Participation Agreement will provide for the
                                following:

                                        6

<PAGE>

       Demand Registration      Holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
       Rights:                  Stock comprising Registrable Securities may
                                initiate an initial registration.

                                Holders of 20% or more of the outstanding Common
                                Stock comprising Registrable Securities may
                                initiate subsequent registrations.

       Piggy-Back Registration  Holders of Registrable Securities have customary
       Rights:                  piggy-back registration rights.

       Expenses:                RACI will bear the registration expenses of the
                                first five demand registrations. In relation to
                                all other demand registrations, the expenses
                                will be apportioned among the participating
                                holders.

       Underwriters' Lock-up:   If RACI files a registration statement for an
                                underwritten public offering of Common Stock, no
                                holder of Registrable Securities may transfer
                                any shares of Common Stock in a public sale
                                (including a sale under Rule 144) during the 20
                                days before and the 180 days after the effective
                                date of the registration statement, or such
                                shorter period as the underwriters may agree. In
                                no event will the Investor be subject to a
                                longer lockup period than any other shareholder.

Information Rights              RACI will provide the Investor and C&D Fund IV
                                with annual, quarterly and monthly financial
                                statements of RACI and its Subsidiaries and such
                                other information as the Investor may reasonably
                                request.

Access                          RACI will provide each of C&D Fund IV and the
                                Investor with such access to information and
                                management as it may reasonably request.

Repurchases from Employees:     In the event that C&D Fund IV is given the
                                opportunity to exercise any right of first
                                refusal or other right to repurchase any options
                                or shares of capital stock from any employees of
                                the Company, the Investor will be given the
                                opportunity to purchase its pro rata share of
                                such options or shares of capital

                                stock.

Amendment                       The Shareholders Agreement may only be amended
                                by written agreement executed by C&D Fund IV,
                                the Investor and RACI.

Termination:                    The Shareholders Agreement will terminate upon
                                an initial public offering of shares of Common
                                Stock.
