Dear  Cody:

     I  thought  I  should formalize our understanding with regards to Winterton
Ranches'  contract  to purchase trout from Woodland Hatchery, Inc.  The original
contract  calls for the purchase of 2,000 pounds of fish on or about July 1st of
2002,  which  did  not  occur  due  to  slow  maturing  fish.

     I  want  you let you know that Winterton Ranches will purchase as many fish
as  you can produce this next season, as they mature-the sooner the better.   It
is  my  hope that the warm winter will further the maturing process along and we
will  have  plenty  for  our  needs.

Thank  you.
