           AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES AND THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

SECTION 2.01. The Advances. (a) The Revolving Credit Advances. Each Lender
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make
advances (each a "Revolving Credit Advance") to each Borrower from time to time
on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the
Termination Date in an amount for each such Revolving Credit Advance (determined
in the case of any Revolving Credit Advance denominated in a Primary Currency by
reference to the Equivalent thereof in US Dollars on such Business Day) not to
exceed such Lender's Unused Revolving Credit Commitment at such time; provided,
however, that, after giving effect to such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the sum
of (x) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances, Swing
Line Advances, Letter of Credit Advances and Competitive Bid Advances made
hereunder and outstanding on such Business Day plus (y) the aggregate Available
Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding on such Business Day shall not
exceed the Revolving Credit Facility on such Business Day. Each Revolving Credit
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Equivalent thereof in the Primary
Currency in which such Revolving Credit Borrowing is denominated) (other than a
Borrowing the proceeds of which shall be used solely to repay or prepay in full
outstanding Swing Line Advances or outstanding Letter of Credit Advances) and
shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances of the same Type and in the same
currency made simultaneously by the Lenders ratably according to their Revolving
Credit Commitments; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Revolving
Credit Borrowing denominated in a Primary Currency, the Foreign Loan Amount on
such date shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any "Revolving Credit Advances"
outstanding on the Effective Date under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be
Revolving Credit Advances for all purposes hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the Borrowers may
borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.11 and reborrow
under this Section 2.01.

      (b) The Swing Line Advances. Paxar may request the Swing Line Bank to
make, and the Swing Line Bank shall make, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, Swing Line Advances to Paxar from time to time on any
Business Day during the period from the date hereof until the Termination Date
(i) in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding $10,000,000
(the "Swing Line Facility") and (ii) in an amount for each such Swing Line
Borrowing not to exceed the aggregate of the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments
of the Lenders at such time. No Swing Line Advance shall be used for the purpose
of funding the payment of principal of any other Swing Line Advance. Each Swing
Line Borrowing shall be in an amount of $100,000 or an integral multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof and shall be made as a Prime Rate Advance or shall
bear interest at such other interest rate, if any, as may be agreed upon by
Paxar and the Swing Line Bank. Any "Swing Line Advances" outstanding on the
Effective Date under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be Swing Line Advances
for all purposes hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. Within the limits
of the Swing Line Facility and within the limits referred to in clause (ii)
above, Paxar may borrow under this Section 2.01(b), repay pursuant to Section
2.07(c) or prepay pursuant to Section 2.11 and reborrow under this Section
2.01(b).

(c) Letters of Credit. The Issuing Bank agrees, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit (together with the SunTrust
LC, the "Letters of Credit") for the account of a Borrower from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until 60 days before the
Termination Date (i) in an aggregate Available Amount for all Letters of Credit
not to exceed at any time the Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit Commitment at such
time and (ii) in an Available Amount for each such Letter of Credit not to
exceed the lesser of (x) the Letter of Credit Facility at such time and (y) the
Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at such time. No Letter of
Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the relevant
Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of 60
days before the Termination Date and (A) in the case of a Standby Letter of
Credit (other than the SunTrust LC), one year after the date of issuance
thereof, but may by its terms be automatically renewable annually upon notice (a
"Notice of Renewal") given to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent on
or prior to any date for notice of renewal set forth in such Letter of Credit
but in any event at least three Business Days prior to the date of the proposed
renewal of such Standby Letter of Credit and upon fulfillment of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III unless such Issuing Bank has notified the
relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the
date for notice of termination set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any
event at least 30 Business Days prior to the date of automatic renewal of its
election not to renew such Standby Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Termination"))
and (B) in the case of a Trade Letter of Credit, 60 days after the date of
issuance thereof; provided that the terms of each Standby Letter of Credit that
is automatically renewable annually shall (x) require the Issuing Bank that
issued such Standby Letter of Credit to give the beneficiary named in such
Standby Letter of Credit notice of any Notice of Termination, (y) permit such
beneficiary, upon receipt of such notice, to draw under such Standby Letter of
Credit prior to the date such Standby Letter of Credit otherwise would have been
automatically renewed and (z) not permit the expiration date (after giving
effect to any renewal) of such Standby Letter of Credit in any event to be
extended to a date later than 60 days before the Termination Date. If either a
Notice of Renewal is not given by the relevant Borrower or a Notice of
Termination is given by the Issuing Bank pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit shall expire on the date on which it
otherwise would have been automatically renewed; provided, however, that even in
the absence of receipt of a Notice of Renewal the Issuing Bank may in its
discretion, unless instructed to the contrary by the Administrative Agent or the
relevant Borrower, deem that a Notice of Renewal had been timely delivered and
in such case, a Notice of Renewal shall be deemed to have been so delivered for
all purposes under this Agreement. Any "Letters of Credit" outstanding on the
Effective Date under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be Letters of Credit
for all purposes hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. Within the limits
of the Letter of Credit Facility, and subject to the limits referred to above,
the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this Section
2.01(c), repay any Letter of Credit Advances resulting from drawings thereunder
pursuant to Section 2.04(c) and request the issuance of additional Letters of
Credit under this Section 2.01(c). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood
that SunTrust shall not issue Letters of Credit hereunder other than the
SunTrust LC.

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section
2.02(b) or 2.03, each Borrowing (other than a Competitive Bid Borrowing) shall
be made on notice, given not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, or the first Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Prime Rate Advances, by the relevant Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by
telecopier or telex. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing")
shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier or telex
in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the
requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Facility under which such Borrowing
is to be made, (iii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iv) aggregate
amount of such Borrowing, and (v) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and the currency for each
such Advance. Each Lender shall, before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in
same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent will
make such funds available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's address
referred to in Section 9.02.

      (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later
than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Swing Line
Borrowing, by Paxar to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative Agent. Each
such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "Notice of Swing Line Borrowing") shall
be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier,
specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) amount of such
Borrowing and (iii) interest rate to be applicable to the Advances comprising
such Borrowing (which interest rate shall either be the Prime Rate or such other
interest rate as may be agreed upon by Paxar and the Swing Line Bank). The Swing
Line Bank will make the amount thereof available to the Administrative Agent at
the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds. After the Administrative
Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds
available to Paxar at the Administrative Agent's address referred to in Section
9.02. Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank, with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent, each other Lender shall purchase from the Swing Line
Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall sell and assign to each such other Lender,
such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Swing Line Advance as of
the date of such demand, by making available for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line
Bank, by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an
amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing
Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Paxar hereby agrees to each such
sale and assignment. Effective upon each such sale and assignment, each Swing
Line Advance purchased by a Lender shall be, for all purposes under this
Agreement, a Revolving Credit Advance (which shall be a Prime Rate Advance).
Upon any such assignment by the Swing Line Bank to any other Lender of a portion
of a Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank represents and warrants to such
other Lender that the Swing Line Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such
interest being assigned by it, free and clear of any liens, but makes no other
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such
Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the extent
that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the Swing Line Bank until the
date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account
of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of
principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such
Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal
amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line Bank shall be reduced by
such amount on such Business Day.

      (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i)
a Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the
aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $10,000,000 or if the obligation
of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall then be suspended
pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.13 and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not
be outstanding as part of more than 10 separate Borrowings.

      (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing shall be
irrevocable and binding on the relevant Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing
that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any
failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made
by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

      (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.02 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the appropriate Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the appropriate Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the appropriate Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such
Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such
amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

      (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part
of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. The Competitive Bid Advances. (a) Each Lender severally agrees
that Paxar may make Competitive Bid Borrowings under this Section 2.03 from time
to time on any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until the
date occurring 30 days prior to the Termination Date in the manner set forth
below; provided that, following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing,
(x) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding shall
not exceed $60,000,000 and (y) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Advances, the Swing Line Advances, the Letter of Credit
Advances and the Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding plus the aggregate
Available Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders.

                (i) Paxar may request a Competitive Bid Borrowing under this
Section 2.03 by delivering to the Administrative Agent, by telecopier or telex,
a notice of a Competitive Bid Borrowing (a "Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing"), in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying therein
the requested (v) date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, (w) aggregate
amount of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, (x) in the case of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, the Interest Period
for and the maturity date of such LIBO Rate Advance, or in the case of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances, maturity date for
repayment of each Fixed Rate Advance to be made as part of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing (which maturity date may not be earlier than the date occurring 7 days
after the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing or later than the earlier of
(I) 180 days after the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing and (II) the
Termination Date), (y) interest payment date or dates relating thereto, and (z)
other terms (if any) to be applicable to such Competitive Bid Borrowing, not
later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (A) at least one Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if Paxar shall specify in
the Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that the rates of interest to be offered
by the Lenders shall be fixed rates per annum (the Advances comprising any such
Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to herein as "Fixed Rate Advances") and
(B) at least five Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Competitive
Bid Borrowing, if Paxar shall instead specify in the Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing that the rates of interest be offered by the Lenders are to be based
on the LIBO Rate (the Advances comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing being
referred to herein as "LIBO Rate Advances"). Each Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on Paxar. The Administrative Agent
shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of each request for a Competitive Bid
Borrowing received by it from Paxar by sending such Lender a copy of the related
Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                (ii) Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to
do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more Competitive Bid Advances to Paxar
as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing at a rate or rates of
interest specified by such Lender in its sole discretion, by notifying the
Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to Paxar), before
9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such proposed Competitive Bid
Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate
Advances and before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days before
the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, of the minimum
amount and maximum amount of each Competitive Bid Advance which such Lender
would be willing to make as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing
(which amounts may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section
2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment, if any), the rate or rates of interest
therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with respect to such
Competitive Bid Advance; provided that if the Administrative Agent in its
capacity as a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any such
offer, it shall notify Paxar of such offer at least 30 minutes before the time
and on the date on which notice of such election is to be given to the
Administrative Agent by the other Lenders. If any Lender shall elect not to make
such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, before
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date on which notice of such election is
to be given to the Administrative Agent by the other Lenders, and such Lender
shall not be obligated to, and shall not, make any Competitive Bid Advance as
part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing; provided that the failure by any Lender
to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any
Competitive Bid Advance as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing.

                (iii)Paxar shall, in turn, before 10:30 A.M. (New York City
time) on the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00
A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days before the date of such proposed
Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting
of LIBO Rate Advances, either:

                         (x) cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by giving the
                Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or

                         (y) accept one or more of the offers made by any Lender
                or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole
                discretion, by giving notice to the Administrative Agent of the
                amount of each Competitive Bid Advance (which amount shall be
                equal to or greater than the minimum amount, and equal to or
                less than the maximum amount, notified to Paxar by the
                Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender for such
                Competitive Bid Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be
                made by each Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing,
                and reject any remaining offers made by Lenders pursuant to
                paragraph (ii) above by giving the Administrative Agent notice
                to that effect. Paxar shall accept the offers made by any Lender
                or Lenders to make Competitive Bid Advances in order of the
                lowest to the highest rates of interest offered by such Lenders.
                If two or more Lenders have offered the same interest rate, the
                amount to be borrowed at such interest rate will be allocated
                among such Lenders in proportion to the amount that each such
                Lender offered at such interest rate.

                (iv) If Paxar notifies the Administrative Agent that such
Competitive Bid Borrowing is canceled pursuant to paragraph (iii)(x) above, the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and such
Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made.

                (v) If Paxar accepts one or more of the offers made by any
Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, the Administrative Agent
shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Lender that has made an offer as
described in paragraph (ii) above, of the date and aggregate amount of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing and whether or not any offer or offers made by such
Lender pursuant to paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by Paxar, (B) each
Lender that is to make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing, of the amount of each Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such
Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and (C) each Lender that is to
make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, upon
receipt, that the Administrative Agent has received forms of documents appearing
to fulfill the applicable conditions set forth in Article III. Each Lender that
is to make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing
shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing specified in the notice received from the Administrative Agent
pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence or any later time when such
Lender shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent pursuant to
clause (C) of the preceding sentence, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's portion of such Competitive
Bid Borrowing. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III and after receipt by the Administrative Agent of such funds, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to Paxar at the
Administrative Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02. Promptly after each
Competitive Bid Borrowing the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of
the amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing and the Unused Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Lenders after giving effect to such Competitive Bid
Borrowing.

                (vi) If Paxar notifies the Administrative Agent that it accepts
one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph
(iii)(y) above, such notice of acceptance shall be irrevocable and binding on
Paxar. Paxar shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense
incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the
date specified in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing for such
Competitive Bid Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Competitive Bid
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing when
such Competitive Bid Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such
date.

     (b) Each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and,
following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the Borrowers shall be
in compliance with the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first
sentence of subsection (a) above.

     (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section 2.03,
Paxar may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.03, repay or prepay
pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section 2.03, provided
that a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made within three Business Days of
the date of any other Competitive Bid Borrowing.

     (d) Paxar shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender that has made a Competitive Bid Advance, on the maturity date of each
Competitive Bid Advance (such maturity date being that specified by Paxar for
repayment of such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive
Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above and provided in the
Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance), the then unpaid
principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. Paxar shall have no right to
prepay any principal amount of any Competitive Bid Advance unless, and then only
on the terms, specified by Paxar for such Competitive Bid Advance in the related
Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above and set forth in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid
Advance.

<PAGE>

     (e) Paxar shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Competitive Bid Advance from the date of such Competitive Bid Advance to the
date the principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance is repaid in full, at
the rate of interest for such Competitive Bid Advance specified by the Lender
making such Competitive Bid Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered
pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above, payable on the interest payment date or
dates specified by Paxar for such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice
of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as
provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Paxar
shall pay interest on the amount of unpaid principal of and interest on each
Competitive Bid Advance owing to a Lender, payable in arrears on the date or
dates interest is payable thereon, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2%
per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Competitive Bid
Advance under the terms of the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive
Bid Advance unless otherwise agreed in such Competitive Bid Note.

     (f) The indebtedness of Paxar resulting from each Competitive Bid Advance
shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of Paxar payable to the
order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

     (g) Upon delivery of each Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing, Paxar shall
pay a non-refundable fee of $3,500 to the Administrative Agent for its own
account.

SECTION 2.04. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of
Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon
notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fifth
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, by the relevant Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or
telecopier. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of
Issuance") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or
telecopier, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such issuance (which
shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (C)
expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) name and address of the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit, and
shall be accompanied by such application and agreement for letter of credit as
the Issuing Bank may specify to such Borrower for use in connection with such
requested Letter of Credit (a "Letter of Credit Agreement"). If (x) the
requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its
sole discretion and (y) it has not received written notice of objection to such
issuance from the Required Lenders, the Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit
available to the relevant Borrower at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or
as otherwise agreed with such Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the
event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement
shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
govern.

      (b) Letter of Credit Reports. The Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender on the first Business Day of each month a
written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit
issued during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all
Letters of Credit and (B) to the Administrative Agent and each Lender on the
first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the
average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter
of all Letters of Credit.

      (c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by the Issuing Bank of a draft
drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance, which
shall be a Prime Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. Upon written demand
by the Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent,
each Lender shall purchase from the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall
sell and assign to each such Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the
outstanding principal amount of such Letter of Credit Advance to be purchased by
such Lender. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent shall
transfer such funds to the Issuing Bank. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each
such sale and assignment. Each Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of
an outstanding Letter of Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand
therefor is made by the Issuing Bank, provided notice of such demand is given
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the
first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given
after such time. Upon any such assignment by the Issuing Bank to any other
Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, the Issuing Bank represents
and warrants to such other Lender that the Issuing Bank is the legal and
beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, free and clear of any
liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents
or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made
the amount of such Letter of Credit Advance available to the Administrative
Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand
by the Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of the Issuing
Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such
amount for the account of the Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so
paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by
such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the
outstanding principal amount of the Letter of Credit Advance made by the Issuing
Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.


                                       18
<PAGE>

      (d) Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The failure of any Lender
to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date specified in
Section 2.04(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder
to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Letter of Credit
Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

SECTION 2.05. Fees. (a) Revolving Credit Facility Fee. Paxar agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender (other than the
Designated Bidders) a facility fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial
Lender and from the later of the Effective Date and the effective date specified
in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the
case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a rate per annum equal
to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears
quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing [September 30], 2002, and on the Termination Date.

      (b) Utilization Fee. Paxar agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender a utilization fee on the aggregate amount of the
outstanding Advances owing to such Lender for each day on which the aggregate
amount of all outstanding Advances exceeds 50% of the aggregate Commitments, at
a rate per annum equal to 0.125%, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day
of each March, June, September and December of any such period, and, if
applicable, on the Termination Date.

      (c) Letter of Credit Fees, Etc. (i) Paxar shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a commission, payable in arrears quarterly
on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing
[September 30], 2002, and on the earliest to occur of the full drawing,
expiration, termination or cancellation of any such Letter of Credit and on the
Termination Date, on such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the average daily aggregate
Available Amount during such quarter of all Letters of Credit outstanding from
time to time at the Applicable Margin then in effect for the Revolving Credit
Facility.

                (ii) Paxar shall pay to the Issuing Bank, for its own account,
such commissions, issuance fees, fronting fees, transfer fees and other fees and
charges in connection with the issuance or administration of each Letter of
Credit as Paxar and the Issuing Bank shall agree.

      (d) Administrative Agent's Fees. Paxar shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between
Paxar and the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.06. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. The Borrower shall
have the right, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the Administrative
Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the Unused Revolving
Credit Commitments of the Lenders, provided that each partial reduction shall be
in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof and provided further that the aggregate amount of the Revolving
Credit Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less
than an amount equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the
Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding and (y) the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit then outstanding.

SECTION 2.07. Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Credit Advances. Each
Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the
Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Advances then outstanding.

      (b) Swing Line Advances. Paxar shall repay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Swing Line Bank and each other Lender that has made a Swing
Line Advance the outstanding principal amount of each Swing Line Advance made by
each of them on the earliest of (i) the date repayment is demanded by the Swing
Line Bank, (ii) 60 days after such Swing Line Advance is made and (iii) the
Termination Date.

      (c) Letter of Credit Advances. (i) The relevant Borrower shall repay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank and each other
Lender that has made a Letter of Credit Advance on the earlier of demand and the

Advance made by each of them.

                (ii) The Obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to any
Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit
Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances,
including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it being understood
that any such payment by a Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not
constitute a waiver of, any rights such Borrower might have or might acquire as
a result of the payment by the Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by
such Borrower thereof):

                     (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
        Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any
        other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing
        being, collectively, the "L/C Related Documents");

                     (B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
        or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of any Borrower
        in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver
        of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related
        Documents;

                     (C) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
        right that a Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or
        any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such
        beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or
        any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
        contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                     (D) any statement or any other document presented under a

                     (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
        against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
        comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

        the L/C Related Documents; or

                                       19
<PAGE>

      (d) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar
to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, any other circumstance
that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a
Borrower or a guarantor.

SECTION 2.08. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest
on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance (other than Competitive Bid
Advances or Swing Line Advances that are not Prime Rate Advances) owing to each
Lender by such Borrower from the date of such Advance until such principal
amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                (i) Prime Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is
a Prime Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Prime Rate in
effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each
March, June, September and December during such periods and on the date such
Prime Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such
Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurocurrency
Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in
effect on the first day of such Interest Period, payable in arrears on the last
day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more
than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every

(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum
above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance pursuant to clause
(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid
when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid
in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on
demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate
per annum required to be paid on Prime Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i)
above.

      (c) Additional Interest on Eurocurrency Rate Advances. Each Borrower shall
pay to each Lender, so long as and to the extent such Lender shall be required
under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such
Eurocurrency Rate Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at an
interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by
subtracting (a) the Eurocurrency Rate for the applicable Interest Period for
such Eurocurrency Rate Advance from (b) the rate obtained by dividing such
Eurocurrency Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurocurrency Rate
Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date
on which interest is otherwise payable on such Eurocurrency Rate Advance. Such
Lender shall as soon as practicable provide notice to the Administrative Agent
and the Borrowers of any such additional interest arising in connection with any
such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, which notice shall be conclusive and binding,
absent manifest error.

      (b) If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Required
Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for any
Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such
Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency
Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith
so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each Eurocurrency Rate
Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in US Dollars,
Convert into Prime Rate Advances and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are
denominated in a Primary Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of US
Dollars and converted into Prime Rate Advances, and (ii) the obligation of the
Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

      (c) If a Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period
for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained
in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent
will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
(i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in US Dollars, Convert
into Prime Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are
denominated in a Primary Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of US
Dollars and Converted into Prime Rate Advances.

      (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment
or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in US
Dollars, Convert into Prime Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate
Advances are denominated in a Primary Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent
amount of US Dollars and Converted into Prime Rate Advances.

      (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate
Advances are denominated in US Dollars, Convert into Prime Rate Advances and (B)
if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Primary Currency, be
exchanged for an Equivalent amount of US Dollars and Converted into Prime Rate
Advances and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances
into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.

SECTION 2.10. Conversion of Advances. Each Borrower may on any Business Day,
upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New
York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.09 and 2.13, Convert all
Advances owing by such Borrower (other than Competitive Bid Advances) of one
Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances (other than Competitive Bid
Advances) of the other Type, so long as, after giving effect to any such
Conversion, each such Borrowing is comprised of Advances denominated in the same
currency and, in the case of any Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, having the same Interest Period; provided, however, that (w) no
Eurocurrency Rate Advances of one currency shall be Converted into Eurocurrency
Rate Advances of another currency, (x) any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate
Advances into Prime Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an
Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, (y) any Conversion of Prime
Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less
than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(c) and (z) no Conversion of
any such Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under
Section 2.02(c). Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions
specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to
be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Advances,
the currency of and the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such
Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the
relevant Borrower.

SECTION 2.11. Prepayments. (a) Optional. Each Borrower may, upon at least one
Business Day's notice in the case of Prime Rate Advances and three Business
Days' notice in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in each case to the
Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of
the prepayment, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing by such Borrower and
comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof (or the Equivalent thereof in the Primary Currency in which such
Revolving Credit Borrowing is denominated, determined on the date the related
notice of prepayment is given) and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c).

                                       21
<PAGE>

      (b) Mandatory. (i) Paxar shall, on each Business Day, prepay an aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowings, the Letter of Credit Advances and the Swing Line Advances equal to
the amount by which (A) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of (u) the
Revolving Credit Advances denominated in US Dollars, plus (v) the Equivalent on
such day of the Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Primary Currencies,
plus (w) the Letter of Credit Advances, plus (x) the aggregate Available Amount
of all Letters of Credit then outstanding, plus (y) the Swing Line Advances plus
(z) the Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding exceeds (B) the Revolving
Credit Facility.

                (ii) Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made pursuant
to clause (i) above shall be first applied to prepay Letter of Credit Advances
then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full, second applied to prepay
Swing Line Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full and
third applied to prepay Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding comprising
part of the same Borrowings until such Advances are paid in full.

               (iii) All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be made
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid.

SECTION 2.12. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or making,
funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
(excluding for purposes of this Section 2.12 any such increased costs resulting
from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.15 shall govern) and (ii)
changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income
by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of
which such Lender Party is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof), then Paxar shall from time to time, upon demand
by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent),
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost. A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to Paxar and the
Administrative Agent by such Lender Party, shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

      (b) If any Lender Party determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender Party or any corporation controlling such Lender Party and that the
amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of
Credit hereunder and other commitments of this type or the issuance or
maintenance of, or participation in, the Letters of Credit (or similar
contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), Paxar shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from time to time as specified by
such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party
or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such
Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to
the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue or
participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of,
or participation in, any Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to Paxar and the Administrative Agent by such Lender Party shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                                       22

SECTION 2.13. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it
unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its
obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances
hereunder, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as the case
may be, will automatically, upon such demand, be exchanged for an Equivalent
amount of US Dollars and Converted into a Prime Rate Advance or an Advance that
bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.08(a)(i), as the case may be,
and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or
LIBO Rate Advances or to Convert Prime Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify Paxar
and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

SECTION 2.14. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall make each
payment required to be made by it hereunder and under the Notes not later than
12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in like funds as advanced to
the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day
funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed
like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or facility or
Letter of Credit fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.03, 2.12, 2.15 or 9.04(c)) to the Lender Parties for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of
any other amount payable to any Lender Party to such Lender Party for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(g), from and after the effective date
specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make
all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned
thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to such
Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

      (b) Each Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder or under
any Note held by such Lender Party, to charge from time to time against any or
all of such Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party any amount so due.

      (c) All computations of interest based on the Prime Rate shall be made by
the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the
Federal Funds Rate and of Facility and Letter of Credit fees shall be made by
the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or facility fees are payable.
Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to
be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility or Letter of
Credit fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would
cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO
Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

      (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender Party
hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender Party on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If and
to the extent a Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Lender Party shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender Party together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                                       23

SECTION 2.15. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by a Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.14, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and the Administrative Agent, taxes
imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
overall net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such
Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or
any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender Party, taxes
imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of
overall net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender Party's Applicable
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in
respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If a Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender Party or
the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower
shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance
with applicable law.

      (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other
Taxes").

      (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and the Administrative
Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 2.15) imposed on or paid by such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender
Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand
therefor.

      (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the relevant
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to
in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such
payment. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf
of a Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on
behalf of a Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such
Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower
shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Administrative
Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Administrative
Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this
subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "United States" and "United States
person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

      (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender or the Initial Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which
it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time
to time thereafter as requested in writing by a Borrower (but only so long as
such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service
Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the form provided by a
Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a party to this
Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of
zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes
unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate forms certifying
that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only
shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form;
provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which a Lender Party assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the
Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect
of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date,
then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding
taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the
Lender Party assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this
subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information
necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof
by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the applicable Lender
Party reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender Party, if legally
required to do so, shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be
obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

      (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party required to do so
has failed to provide a Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section
2.15(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring
subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided,
or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such
Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.15(a) or
(c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such
failure; provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall
take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist the
Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

                                       24
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.16. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) (a) on account of obligations owing to such Lender Party
hereunder and under the Notes in excess of its ratable share of payments on
account of the Obligations owing to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the
Notes at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time, such Lender
Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender Parties such participations
in the Obligations owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each Lender
Party shall be rescinded and such Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing
Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an
amount equal to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other
amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total
amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing a
participation from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of
such participation.

SECTION 2.17. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available
(and Paxar agrees that it and any other Borrower shall use such proceeds) solely
for general corporate purposes of Paxar and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 2.18. Additional Borrowers. Upon the execution and delivery by any
Subsidiary of Paxar acceptable to the Required Lenders in their reasonable
judgment of a supplement to this Agreement, in substantially the form of Exhibit
E hereto (a "Credit Agreement Supplement"), (i) such Person shall be referred to
as a "Borrower" and shall be and become a Borrower, and each reference in this
Agreement to a "Borrower" shall also mean and be a reference to such Borrower
and each reference in any other Loan Document to a "Borrower" or a "Loan Party"
shall also mean and be a reference to such Borrower, and (ii) such Person shall
assume all of the Obligations of a Borrower hereunder. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of each such additional Borrower.

of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves are being maintained, unless

disadvantageous in any material respect to Paxar, such Subsidiary or the Lender
Parties.

      (e) Visitation Rights. At any reasonable time and from time to time,
permit (i) the Administrative Agent or any agents or representatives thereof to
examine and make copies of and abstracts from the records and books of account

      (j) Transactions with Affiliates. Conduct, and cause each of its
Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted under this

SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party hereby appoints and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf
and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly
provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or
collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining
from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take
any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees
to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each notice given to it by Paxar
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, upon request by any Lender Party, a
copy of any such notice.

SECTION 7.02. Administrative Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable

misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance
entered into by the Lender Party that is the payee of such Note, as assignor,
and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07; (ii) may
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Paxar), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Lender Party and shall not be responsible to any Lender
Party for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or

terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of Paxar or to

be responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Fleet and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the Advances
made by it and the Note issued to it, Fleet shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement as any other Lender Party and may exercise the same
as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender",
"Lenders", "Lender Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Fleet in its individual capacity. Fleet and its Affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of,
accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of
business with, Paxar, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business
with or own securities of Paxar or any such Subsidiary, all as if Fleet were not
the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender
Parties.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender Party acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in Section
4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. The Lender Parties (other than the Designated
Bidders) agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by Paxar), ratably according to the respective principal amounts of
the Notes then held by each of them (or if no Notes are at the time outstanding
or if any Notes are held by Persons that are not Lender Parties, ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"), provided that no Lender Party shall be
liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party (other than the Designated
Bidders) agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for
its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the
Borrower, provided that no Lender Party shall be required to reimburse any
portion of such out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the Administrative Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05
applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by
the Administrative Agent, any Lender Party or a third party.

SECTION 7.06. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and
Paxar and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative
Agent may, on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    GUARANTY

SECTION 8.01. Guaranty. Paxar absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees (the undertaking by Paxar under this Article VIII being the
"Guaranty") the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of each other Loan Party now or
hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest,
fees, commissions, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "Guaranteed
Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender Party in enforcing any rights under this
Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Paxar's liability
shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations
and would be owed by any other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender Party under the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Loan Party.

SECTION 8.02. Guaranty Absolute. Paxar guarantees that the Guaranteed
Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect
in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party with respect thereto. The
Obligations of Paxar under this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other Obligations of any Loan Party under the Loan Documents,
and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Paxar to
enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any
other Loan Party or whether any other Loan Party is joined in any such action or
actions. The liability of Paxar under this Guaranty shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of, and Paxar hereby irrevocably
waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any way relating to, any and
all of the following:

      (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any
other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

      (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other
term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of
any Loan Party under the Loan Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or
any consent to departure from any Loan Document (including, without limitation,
any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of
additional credit to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise);

      (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral or
any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
other guarantee for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

      (d) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or
existence of any other Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

      (e) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party to
disclose to any Loan Party any information relating to the financial condition,
operations, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or hereafter

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party or
by any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any
other Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

SECTION 8.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) Paxar hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other

other Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or its property and assets now or
hereafter known by the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party.

      (c) Paxar hereby unconditionally waives any right to revoke this Guaranty,
and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all
Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

in contemplation of such benefits.

SECTION 8.04. Subrogation. Paxar hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
not to exercise any rights that it may now have or may hereafter acquire against
any other Loan Party or any other insider guarantor that arise from the
existence, payment, performance or enforcement of its Obligations under this
Guaranty or under any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender against such other Loan Party or any other
insider guarantor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity
or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the
right to take or receive from such other Loan Party or any other insider
guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in

until such time as all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, all of the
Letters of Credit shall have expired, terminated or been canceled and the
Commitments shall have expired or terminated. If any amount shall be paid to
Paxar in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to

Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been
paid in full in cash, (iii) all of the Letters of Credit shall have expired,

and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer of
subrogation to Paxar of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from
the payment made by Paxar.

SECTION 8.05. Continuing Guarantee; Assignments. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until (subject to

cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under
this Guaranty, (ii) the full drawing, termination, expiration or cancellation of
all Letters of Credit, and (iii) the Termination Date, (b) be binding upon Paxar

this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its
Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Notes held by it) to
any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all
the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender Party under this Article
VIII or otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 9.07.

SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) Paxar agrees to pay on demand all costs
and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,

and (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent
with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to
its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Borrower further
agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and
the Lender Parties, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel
fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation,

directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from
and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that
may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without

alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of Paxar or any of its

its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or
expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by Paxar, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an
Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a
party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated. Paxar also agrees not to assert any claim against the
Administrative Agent, any Lender Party, any of their Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising
out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement, any of the other Loan
Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed

Advance, or if any payment of principal of any Swing Line Advance (other than a
Swing Line Advance that is a Prime Rate Advance) is made by Paxar to or for the
account of the Swing Line Bank other than on the day on which Paxar and the
Swing Line Bank had agreed such Swing Line Advance would be payable, as a result
of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09(d) or (e), 2.11 or 2.13,
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any
other reason, such Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of

any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a
result of such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss
(including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

      (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the

in Sections 2.12, 2.15 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes.

continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the

provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender Party and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at
any time owing by such Lender Party or such Affiliate to or for the credit or
the account of a Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the
Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Notes held by
such Lender Party, whether or not such Lender Party shall have made any demand
under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender Party agrees promptly to notify the relevant Borrower
after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights

shall have been executed by Paxar and the Administrative Agent and when the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender and the

the names and addresses of the Lender Parties and, with respect to Lender
Parties other than Designated Bidders, the Commitment of, and principal amount
of the Advances owing to, each Lender Party from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender Party at any reasonable

such obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative

with such Lender Party in connection with such Lender Party's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such
participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Note or any other Loan Document, or any
consent to any departure by the Borrowers therefrom, except to the extent that
such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on,
the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the
extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment
of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation.

       (j) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment, designation

designee or participant or proposed assignee, designee or participant shall
agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating
to the Borrowers received by it from such Lender.

      (k) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any
Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of

sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if
such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the Issuing Bank against presentation of
documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including
failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the
Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing
to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the relevant Borrower
shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be
liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential,
damages suffered by such Borrower that such Borrower proves were caused by (i)
the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether
documents presented under any Letter of Credit issued on account of such
Borrower comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) the Issuing
Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit issued on
account of such Borrower after the presentation to it of a draft and
certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary.

SECTION 9.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 9.11. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12. Judgment. (a) Rate of Exchange. If, for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder
(including, without limitation, under Section 8.01) or under any Note or Notes
in another currency into US Dollars or into a Primary Currency, as the case may
be, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do
so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with
normal banking procedures, a Lender Party could purchase such other currency
with US Dollars or with a Primary Currency, as the case may be, in New York
City, New York at the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the day on which final judgment is given, together with any premiums
and costs of exchange payable in connection with such purchase.

      (b) Indemnity. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due
from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party hereunder or under any
Note or Notes shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than US
Dollars or a Primary Currency, as the case may be, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day next succeeding receipt by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party may, in accordance with
normal banking procedures, purchase US Dollars or such Primary Currency, as the
case may be, with such other currency. If the US Dollars or such Primary
Currency so purchased are less than the sum originally due to the Administrative
Agent or such Lender Party in US Dollars or in such Primary Currency, each
Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment,
to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party against such loss,
and if the US Dollars or such Primary Currency so purchased exceed the sum
originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party in US Dollars or
in such Primary Currency, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender Party agrees to remit to such Borrower such excess.

SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the
United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Notes or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to
the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each Borrower further
irrevocably consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding in
such courts by the mailing thereof by any parties thereto by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Borrower at its address specified
pursuant to Section 9.02 or in the Credit Agreement Supplement. Each Borrower
(other than Paxar) hereby further agrees that service of process in any such
action or proceeding brought in any such New York state court or in any such
federal court may be made upon Paxar at its address specified in Section 9.02,
and each Borrower (other than Paxar) hereby irrevocably appoints Paxar as its
authorized agent to accept such service of process, and hereby irrevocably
agrees that the failure of Paxar to give any notice of such service to such
Borrower shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any
judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

      (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes or the
other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

      (c) To the extent that any Borrower has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such
Borrower hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations
under this Agreement and the Notes and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 9.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent and the Lender Parties hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by
jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes or the
other Loan Documents or the actions of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
Party in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.
