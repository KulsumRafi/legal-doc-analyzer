2        THE FACILITY

2.1      The Facility shall consist of a loan drawn pursuant to the terms of
         this Agreement of a maximum principal amount not exceeding the Maximum
         Loan Amount.

2.2      Unless VF otherwise agrees in writing with the Borrower, the Facility
         will be used by the Borrower to fund its working capital requirements.
         VF shall not be bound to enquire as to, nor shall it be responsible
         for, the use or application by the Borrower of all or any part of the
         Facility.

3        TERM AND DRAWDOWN

3.1      Subject to Clause 4 and to the first drawing hereunder taking place
         prior to the expiry of the Drawdown Period, the Facility shall be
         available for drawing by the Borrower at any time within the
         Availability Period. VF shall not, other than in its absolute
         discretion, permit drawings to be made under this Agreement more
         frequently than the Drawing Frequency detailed in paragraph 5 of Part 1
         of the Schedule.

                                      -3-




<PAGE>

3.2      VF shall not be obliged to permit any drawing hereunder (other than in
         its absolute discretion) if the Borrower is in breach of or has at any
         time breached the Interest Cover Covenant.

3.3      VF shall not be obliged to permit any drawing hereunder or make any
         payment to the Borrower pursuant to the Agreement for the Purchase of
         Debts (other than in its absolute discretion) if following a notional
         or actual combination of all accounts of the Borrower with VF
         (including all actual and/or contingent liabilities of the Borrower to
         VF at the relevant time) ("the Account Balance") the drawing or payment
         of such amount would cause the Account Balance to exceed the Aggregate
         Limit. If as a consequence of such assessment and/or combination it is
         found that the Account Balance is at that time in excess of the
         Aggregate Limit the Borrower shall forthwith upon VF's demand repay to
         VF such amount as shall be required to extinguish such excess.

3.4      VF shall be entitled from time to time and at any time to combine all
         and any accounts maintained in the name of the Borrower in the books of
         VF, such combination being deemed to have taken place on the happening
         of any Event of Default. The Borrower will upon demand in writing from
         VF pay such amount as may be required to bring the account of the
         Borrower within the monetary limits stated in this Agreement.

4        CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         The Facility will only be available for drawing under Clause 3 if:-

         (a)      the Agreement for the Purchase of Debts has commenced and all
                  conditions precedent to the making of prepayments thereunder
                  by VF have been satisfied; and

         (b)      the Security Document duly executed by the Borrower has been
                  received by VF together with copy Board Minutes authorising
                  the entry into and execution of the same; and

         (c)      there is no Event of Default and no event has occurred which,
                  with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both, might
                  constitute an Event of Default; and

         (d)      the representations and warranties set out in Clause 10 are
                  true and accurate in all material respects; and

         (e)      the Borrower has notified VF in writing of the amount
                  requested to be drawn by the Borrower and full details of the
                  account of the Borrower to which the funds are to be remitted.
                  The Borrower acknowledges that any notice given in accordance
                  with this clause 4(e) shall be irrevocable and, unless VF
                  otherwise agrees, shall oblige the Borrower to borrow the
                  amount specified.

5        INTEREST AND FEES

5.1      Interest will be charged on the Loan Account Balance at the Interest
         Rate and shall accrue from day to day and shall be computed on the
         basis of a 365 day year and the number of days elapsed.

                                      -4-




<PAGE>

5.2      The interest accrued on the Loan Account Balance from and including the
         date upon which the facility is drawn shall be debited to the Loan
         Account monthly. The Borrower and VF hereby agree that for
         administrative convenience all interest payable in respect of the Loan
         Account balance and all other sums payable by the Borrower pursuant to
         this Agreement may be debited by VF to the Current Account of the
         Borrower maintained by VF pursuant to the Agreement for the Purchase of
         Debts. VF reserves the right to require actual payment of all interest
         by cheque drawn by the Client or such other form of remittance as VF
         may from time to time specify.

6        REPAYMENT

         The principal amount of the Facility drawn by the Borrower shall (if
         not repayable at an earlier date pursuant to the terms of this
         Agreement) be repaid in accordance with the Repayment Terms set out in
         paragraph 6 of Part 1 of the Schedule. Notwithstanding any other term
         of this Agreement the Borrower may at any time repay the whole or any
         part of the Loan Account Balance from time to time.

7        DEFAULT INTEREST

7.1      If the Borrower shall fail to pay any amount due under this Agreement
         on its due date, the Borrower shall be liable (if VF so requires) for
         interest on such amount from the date of such default until the date of
         actual payment (after as well as before judgement or demand) at the
         Default Rate. The Borrower's liability under this Clause shall be in
         substitution for the liability for interest on such defaulted amount at
         the Interest Rate. Such interest shall be payable on demand and, to the
         extent not actually paid, shall be compounded monthly in arrears (and
         debited to the Loan Account or the Current Account as referred to in
         clause 5.2 above) and shall be payable before as well as after any
         judgement.

7.2      VF and the Borrower agree that the Default Rate represents a genuine
         pre-estimate of VF's additional administrative and funding costs in the
         event of the Borrower's failure to pay any sum due to VF and is not a
         penalty.

8        PAYMENTS

8.1      The Borrower will make all payments due under this Agreement without
         set-off, counterclaim or deduction whatsoever and howsoever arising.

8.2      If the Borrower is compelled by law to make any such deduction or
         withholding, the Borrower shall forthwith pay to VF such additional
         amount as shall be required to ensure that VF shall receive in
         aggregate the amount it would have received but for such deduction or
         withholding.

9        CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCREASED COSTS

9.1      If at any time it becomes unlawful or impossible for VF to maintain or
         fund the whole or any part of the Loan Account Balance VF may at any
         time by written notice to the Borrower require the Borrower to repay
         the Loan Account Balance immediately, together with any outstanding
         interest and all other sums due to VF under this Agreement, the
         Agreement for the Purchase of Debts, the warrant loan Agreement and the
         Security Document.

                                      -5-




<PAGE>

9.2      The Borrower shall pay to VF on demand such amount as VF may from time
         to time certify as being necessary to compensate it for any increase in
         the cost of funding the Loan Account Balance or for any reduction in
         the rate of return under this Agreement, incurred by VF as a result of
         compliance with any official directives, requirements or requests of
         any regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law) or
         any law or regulation (including, without limitation, those relating to
         reserve assets, special deposits, taxes, capital adequacy and/or asset
         ratios).

                  for the Purchase of Debts (whether or not such right is

                  (i)      for the Borrower to perform any of its respective
                           obligations contained in this Agreement or the
                           Security Document or any of them; or

                  (ii)     for VF to exercise any of its rights under this
                           Agreement and/or the Agreement for the Purchase of
                           Debts and/or the Security Document; or

         (f)      this Agreement and/or the Security Document do not come into
                  or cease to be in full force and effect or is/are not for any
                  reason valid and binding upon and enforceable in all respects
                  against the Borrower or VF is of the reasonable opinion that
                  any security conferred thereby is or may be in jeopardy; or

                  Borrower which VF believes may materially impair the security
                  created by the Security Document and/or prejudice or detract
                  from the Borrower's ability to perform the obligations
                  contained in this Agreement and the Security Document or any
                  of them; or

                  delivered to it at the time required; or

         (j)      the Borrower is or has been in breach of the Interest Cover
                  Covenant,

         then, in any such event VF may by notice in writing terminate the
         Facility and declare the Loan Account Balance and any other amounts due
         hereunder immediately due and payable, whereupon the Borrower will
         immediately comply with such demand by repaying the Loan Account
         Balance together with all outstanding interest and any other amounts
         due under this Agreement.
