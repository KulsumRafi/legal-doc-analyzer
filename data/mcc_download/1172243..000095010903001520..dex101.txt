     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Bank,
during the Commitment Period and to the extent hereinafter provided, shall make
Loans to Borrowers and participate in Swing Loans made by the Swing Line Bank to
Borrowers, in such aggregate amount as Borrowers shall request pursuant to the
Commitment; provided, however, that in no event shall the Revolving Credit
Exposure be in excess of the Total Commitment Amount.

     (b) Each Bank, for itself and not one for any other, agrees to make Loans
and participate in Swing Loans, during the Commitment Period, on such basis
that, immediately after the completion of any borrowing by Borrowers, (i) the
aggregate principal amount then outstanding on the Notes (other than the Swing
Line Note) issued to such Bank, when combined with such Bank's pro rata share,
if any, of the Swing Line Exposure, shall not be in excess of the Maximum Amount
for such Bank, and (ii) such aggregate principal amount outstanding on the Notes
(other than the Swing Line Note) issued to such Bank shall represent that
percentage of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding on all Notes
(other than the Swing Line Note) together with such Bank's interest in the Swing
Line Exposure that shall be such Bank's Commitment Percentage. Each borrowing
(other than Swing Loans) from the Banks hereunder shall be made pro rata
according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks.

     (c) The Loans shall be made either as Revolving Loans as described in
Section 2.2 hereof or Swing Loans as described in Section 2.4 hereof.

     Section 2.2. Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the Banks shall make a Revolving Loan
or Revolving Loans to Borrowers in such amount or amounts as Borrowers may from
time to time request, but not exceeding in aggregate principal amount at any

Loans are combined with the Swing Line Exposure. Borrowers shall have the
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to borrow

any combination of Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans. Subject to the provisions of

and from time to time during the Commitment Period.

     Section 2.3. [RESERVED]

                                       20

<PAGE>

     Section 2.4. Swing Loans.

     (a) Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
during the Commitment Period, the Swing Line Bank shall make a Swing Loan or
Swing Loans to Borrowers in such amount or amounts as Borrowers may from time to
time request; provided that Borrowers shall not request any Swing Loan hereunder
if, after giving effect thereto, (i) the Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed
the Total Commitment Amount, or (ii) the Swing Line Exposure would exceed the
Swing Line Commitment. Each Swing Loan shall be due and payable on the Swing
Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. Borrowers shall not request that more
than two Swing Loans be outstanding at any time.

     (b) Refunding of Swing Loans. If the Swing Line Bank so elects, by giving
notice to Borrowers and the Banks, Borrowers agree that the Swing Line Bank
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that any Swing Loan be
refinanced as a Revolving Loan. Such Revolving Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan
unless otherwise requested by and available to Borrowers hereunder. Upon receipt
of such notice by Borrowers and the Banks, Borrowers shall be deemed, on such
day, to have requested a Revolving Loan in the principal amount of the Swing
Loan in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.7 hereof (other than the requirement
set forth in subsection (d) of Section 2.7 hereof). Each Bank agrees to make a
Revolving Loan on the date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent
whatsoever. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that such Bank's obligation to
make a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof when required by this
subsection (b) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for
the account of the Swing Line Bank, of the proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall
be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or
reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment
shall have been reduced or terminated. Borrowers irrevocably authorize and
instruct Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this
subsection (b) to repay in full such Swing Loan.

     (c) Participation in Swing Loans. If, for any reason, Agent is unable to
or, in the opinion of Agent, it is impracticable to, convert any Swing Loan to a
Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding subsection (b), then on any day that a
Swing Loan is outstanding (whether before or after the maturity thereof), Agent
shall have the right to request that each Bank purchase a participation in such
Swing Loan, and Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof (by facsimile or
telephone, confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action,
the Swing Line Bank hereby agrees to grant to each Bank, and each Bank hereby
agrees to acquire from the Swing Line Bank, an undivided participation interest
in such Swing Loan in an amount equal to such Bank's Commitment Percentage of
the aggregate principal amount of such Swing Loan. In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Bank hereby absolutely and unconditionally
agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent, for the
benefit of the Swing Line Bank, such Bank's ratable share of such Swing Loan
(determined in accordance with such Bank's Commitment Percentage). Each Bank
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participation in Swing
Loans pursuant to this subsection (c) is absolute and unconditional and shall
not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation,
the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that

                                       21

<PAGE>

each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment,
counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such Bank's
Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each Bank
shall comply with its obligation under this subsection (c) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.7
hereof with respect to Revolving Loans to be made by such Bank.

     31, 2003, and on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter and at
     the maturity thereof.

          (ii) LIBOR Loans. Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal

     the Applicable Margin), at the Derived LIBOR Rate. Interest on such LIBOR
     Loan shall be payable on each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an
     Interest Period (provided that if an Interest Period shall exceed three
     months, the interest must be paid every three months, commencing three
     months from the beginning of such Interest Period).

     (b) Swing Loans. Borrowers shall pay interest to Agent, for the sole
benefit of the Swing Line Bank (and any Bank that shall have purchased a

Derived Swing Loan Rate applicable to such Swing Loan. Interest on each Swing
Loan shall be payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. Each
Swing Loan shall bear interest for a minimum of one day.

     (c) Default Rate. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if an
Event of Default shall occur hereunder, upon the election of the Required Banks,
(i) the principal of each Note and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear
interest, until paid, at the Default Rate; and (ii) in the case of any other
amount due from Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document, such
amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate; provided that during an Event of
Default under Section 8.11 hereof, the applicable Default Rate shall apply
without any election or action of the part of Agent or any Bank.

     (d) Limitation on Interest. In no event shall the rate of interest
hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowable by law.

reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate
amount, for all of the Banks, of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000),
increased by increments of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank of the date of each such reduction and such Bank's
proportionate share thereof. After each such reduction, the commitment fees
payable hereunder shall be calculated upon the Total Commitment Amount as so
reduced. If Borrowers reduce in whole the Commitment, on the effective date of
such reduction (Borrowers having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance,
if any, of the Notes, together with all interest and commitment and other fees
accrued and unpaid and provided that no Swing Line Exposure shall exist), all of
the Notes shall be delivered to Agent marked "Canceled" and Agent shall
redeliver such Notes to Borrowers. Any partial reduction in the Total Commitment
Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period.

     (b) Increase in Commitment. At any time during the Commitment Increase
Period, Administrative Borrower may request that Agent increase the Total
Commitment Amount from the Closing Commitment Amount up to the Maximum
Commitment Amount by either (i) increasing, for one or more Banks, with and
subject to their prior written consent, their respective Revolving Credit
Commitments, or (ii) with and subject to the prior written consent of Agent,
including one or more Additional Banks, each with a new Revolving Credit
Commitment, as a party to this Agreement (collectively, the "Additional
Commitment"). During the Commitment Increase Period, the Banks agree that Agent,
in its sole discretion, may permit one or more Additional Commitments upon
satisfaction of the following requirements: (A) each Additional Bank, if any,
shall execute an Additional Bank Assumption Agreement, (B) Agent shall provide
to each Bank a revised Schedule 1 to this Agreement, including revised
Commitment Percentages for each of the Banks, if appropriate, at least three
Business Days prior to the effectiveness of such Additional Commitments (each an
"Additional Bank Assumption Effective Date"), and (C) Borrowers shall execute
and deliver to Agent and the Banks such replacement or additional Revolving
Credit Notes as shall be required by Agent. The Banks hereby authorize Agent to
execute each Additional Bank Assumption Agreement on behalf of the Banks. On
each Additional Bank Assumption Effective Date, the Banks shall make adjustments
among themselves with respect to the Revolving Loans then outstanding and
amounts of principal, interest, commitment fees and other amounts paid or
payable with respect thereto as shall be necessary, in the opinion of Agent, in
order to reallocate among such Banks such outstanding amounts, based on the
revised Commitment Percentages and to otherwise carry out fully the intent and
terms of this subsection (b). Borrowers shall not request any increase in the
Total

                                       26

<PAGE>

Commitment Amount pursuant to this subsection (b) if a Default or an Event of
Default shall then exist, or immediately after giving effect to any such
increase would exist. Borrowers shall pay any attorneys' fees or other expenses
of Agent in connection with the documentation of any such increase, as well as
such other fees as may be agreed upon between Borrowers and Agent.

     Section 2.12. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Loans and
commitment and other fees and charges hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year having three hundred sixty (360) days and calculated for the actual
number of days elapsed.

     Section 2.13. Mandatory Payment.

     (a) If, at any time, the Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Total
Commitment Amount as then in effect, Borrowers shall, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an
aggregate principal amount of the Loans sufficient to bring the Revolving Credit
Exposure within the Total Commitment Amount.

     (b) If, at any time, the Swing Line Exposure shall exceed the Swing Line
Commitment, Borrowers shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Swing
Loans sufficient to bring the Swing Line Exposure within the Swing Line
Commitment.

     (c) If, at any time, a Prepayment Event occurs, Borrower shall, as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, apply the
Prepayment Proceeds to the Revolving Loans. The Revolving Commitments and the
Maximum Commitment Amount shall be permanently reduced by the amount of
Prepayment Proceeds allocated thereto, respectively, whether or not there shall
be any Revolving Credit Exposure thereunder.

     (d) Any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan or Swing Loan pursuant to this Section
2.13 shall be subject to the prepayment penalties set forth in Article III
hereof.

     Section 2.14. Liability of Borrowers.

     (a) Joint and Several Liability. Each Borrower hereby authorizes
Administrative Borrower to request a Loan hereunder. Each Borrower acknowledges
and agrees that Agent and the Banks are entering into this Agreement at the
request of each Borrower and with the understanding that each Borrower is and
shall remain fully liable, jointly and severally, for payment in full of the
Debt. Each Borrower agrees that it is receiving or will receive a direct
pecuniary benefit for each Loan made hereunder.

     (b) Appointment of Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
irrevocably appoints MTCT as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all
Borrowers ("Administrative Borrower") which appointment shall remain in full
force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice
signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another
Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Borrower (i) to provide Agent
with all notices with respect to Loans obtained for the benefit of any Borrower
and all

                                       27

<PAGE>

other notices and instructions under this Agreement and (ii) to take such action
as Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Loans and
to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the
Collateral of Borrowers in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein,
is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the
collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical
manner and at their request, and that neither Agent nor any Bank shall incur
liability to any Borrower as a result hereof. Each Borrower expects to derive
benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Collateral in a
combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on
the continued successful performance of the integrated group.

     (c) Maximum Liability of Each Borrower. Anything in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the
maximum liability of any Subsidiary Borrower exceed the maximum amount that
(after giving effect to the incurring of the obligations hereunder and to any
rights to contribution of such Subsidiary Borrower from other affiliates of such
Subsidiary Borrower) would not render the rights to payment of Agent and the
Banks hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent
transfer law.

     (d) Waivers of Each Borrower. In the event that any obligation of any
Borrower under this Agreement is deemed to be an agreement by such Borrower to
answer for the debt or default of another Credit Party or as a hypothecation of
property as security therefore, each Borrower represents and warrants that (i)
no representation has been made to it as to the creditworthiness of such other
Credit Party, and (ii) it has established adequate means of obtaining from such
other Credit Party on a continuing basis, financial or other information
pertaining to such other Credit Party's financial condition. Each Borrower
expressly waives, except as expressly required under this Agreement, diligence,
demand, presentment, protest and notice of every kind and nature whatsoever,
consents to the taking by Agent and the Banks of any additional security of
another Credit Party for the obligations secured hereby, or the alteration or
release in any manner of any security of another Credit Party now or hereafter
held in connection with the Debt, and consents that Agent, the Banks and any
other Credit Party may deal with each other in connection with said obligations
or otherwise, or alter any contracts now or hereafter existing between them, in
any manner whatsoever, including without limitation the renewal, extension,
acceleration, changes in time for payment of any such obligations or in the
terms or conditions of any security held. Agent and the Banks are hereby
expressly given the right, at their option, to proceed in the enforcement of any
of the Debt independently of any other remedy or security they may at any time
hold in connection with such obligations secured and it shall not be necessary
for Agent and the Banks to proceed upon or against or exhaust any other security
or remedy before proceeding to enforce their rights against such Borrower. Each
Borrower further subordinates any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, setoff or other recourse in respect
of sums paid to Agent and the Banks by any other Credit Party.

     Section 2.15. Extension of Commitment. Contemporaneously with the delivery
of the financial statements required pursuant to Section 5.3(b) hereof
(beginning with the financial statements for MTCT's fiscal year ending December
31, 2003), Administrative Borrower may deliver a Request for Extension,
requesting that the Banks extend the maturity of the

                                       28

<PAGE>

Commitment for an additional year. Each such extension shall require the
unanimous written consent of all of the Banks and shall be upon such terms and
conditions as may be agreed to by Agent, Borrowers and the Banks. Borrowers
shall pay any attorneys' fees or other expenses of Agent in connection with the
documentation of any such extension, as well as such other fees as may be agreed
upon between Borrowers and Agent.

              ARTICLE III. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO LIBOR
                        LOANS; INCREASED CAPITAL; TAXES.

     Section 3.1. Requirements of Law.

     (a) If, after the Closing Date (i) the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or (ii) the
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority:

          (A) shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
     respect to this Agreement or any LIBOR Loan made by it, or change the basis
     of taxation of payments to such Bank in respect thereof (except for Taxes
     and Excluded Taxes which are governed by Section 3.2 hereof);

          (B) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
     deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
     deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or
     other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any
     office of such Bank that is not otherwise included in the determination of
     the LIBOR Rate; or

          (C) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank of
making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case,
Borrowers shall pay to such Bank, promptly after receipt of a written request
therefor, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such
increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Bank becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection (a), it shall promptly
notify Administrative Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of the event by reason of
which it has become so entitled.

     (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the Closing Date, the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or
any corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or
such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder, to a
level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for
such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or
such corporation's policies with respect to

                                       29

<PAGE>

capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon submission by such Bank to
Administrative Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of a written request therefore
(which shall include the method for calculating such amount), Borrowers shall
promptly pay or cause to be paid to such Bank such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

     (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 3.1 submitted by any Bank to Administrative Borrower (with a copy to
Agent) shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. In determining any such
additional amounts, such Bank may use any method of averaging and attribution
that it (in its reasonable discretion) shall deem applicable. The obligations of
Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder
for ninety (90) days.

     Section 3.2. Taxes.

     (a) All payments made by any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account
of any Taxes or Other Taxes. If any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to Agent or any Bank thereunder, the amounts
so payable to Agent or such Bank shall be increased to the extent necessary to
yield to Agent or such Bank (after payment of all Taxes and Other Taxes)
interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the
amounts specified in the Loan Documents.

     (b) In addition, Credit Parties shall pay Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld and paid
by a Credit Party, such Credit Party shall timely withhold and pay such taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authorities. As promptly as possible thereafter,
Borrowers shall send to Agent for its own account or for the account of the
relevant Bank, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official
receipt received by such Credit Party showing payment thereof. If such Credit
Party shall fail to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to Agent the required receipts or other
required documentary evidence, Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and the Banks on
demand for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable
by Agent or any Bank as a result of any such failure.

     (d) If any Bank shall be so indemnified by a Credit Party, such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit
for any taxes or other amounts with respect to the amount paid by such Credit
Party and shall reimburse such Credit Party to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such Bank shall receive a refund with respect to the amount paid by
such Credit Party or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental
charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of
such Bank) of the United States or any state or subdivision or any other
Governmental Authority thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after
first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to
such Bank. If, at the time any audit of such Bank's income tax return is
completed, such Bank determines, based on such audit, that it shall not have
been entitled to the

                                       30

<PAGE>

full amount of any refund reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid or that
its net income taxes shall not have been reduced by a credit or deduction for
the full amount reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid, such Credit Party,
upon request of such Bank, shall promptly pay to such Bank the amount so
refunded to which such Bank shall not have been so entitled, or the amount by
which the net income taxes of such Bank shall not have been so reduced, as the
case may be.

     (e) Each Bank that is not (i) a citizen or resident of the United States of
America, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in
or under the laws of the United States of America (or any jurisdiction thereof),
or (iii) any estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation
regardless of the source of its income (any such Person, a "Non-U.S. Bank")
shall deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent two copies of either U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a
Non-U.S. Bank claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section
871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a
statement with respect to such interest and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by
such Non-U.S. Bank claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S.
federal withholding tax on all payments by Credit Parties under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S.
Bank on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement or such other
Loan Document. In addition, each Non-U.S. Bank shall deliver such forms or
appropriate replacements promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any
from previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Bank. Each Non-U.S. Bank shall
promptly notify Administrative Borrower at any time it determines that it is no
longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to
Administrative Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S.
taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of
this subsection (e), a Non-U.S. Bank shall not be required to deliver any form
pursuant to this subsection (e) that such Non-U.S. Bank is not legally able to
deliver.

     (f) The agreements in this Section 3.2 shall survive the termination of the
Loan Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

     Section 3.3. Funding Losses. Borrowers agree to indemnify each Bank,
promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, and to hold each Bank
harmless from, any loss or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) default by a Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion
into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after such Borrower has given a notice
requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b)
default by a Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Loans
after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans on a day that
is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereof or (d) any
conversion of LIBOR Loans to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof on
a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such
indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the amounts so prepaid, or not so
borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of
such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the

                                       31

<PAGE>

applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein over (ii) the
amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) that would have
accrued to such Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a
comparable period with leading banks in the appropriate London interbank market,
along with any administration fee charged by such Bank. A certificate as to any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 submitted to Administrative
Borrower by any Bank shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The
obligations of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

     Section 3.4. LIBOR Rate Lending Unlawful; Inability to Determine Rate.

     (a) If any Bank shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice
thereof to Administrative Borrower and Agent, be conclusive and binding on
Borrowers absent demonstrable error) that, after the Closing Date, (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it
unlawful, or (ii) any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for
such Bank to make or continue any Loan as, or to convert (if permitted pursuant
to this Agreement) any Loan into, a LIBOR Loan, the obligations of such Bank to
make, continue or convert any such LIBOR Loan shall, upon such determination, be
suspended until such Bank shall notify Agent that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist, and all outstanding LIBOR Loans payable to such Bank
shall automatically convert (if conversion is permitted under this Agreement)
into a Base Rate Loan, or be repaid (if no conversion is permitted) at the end
of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required
by law or such assertion.

     (b) If the Required Banks determine that for any reason adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan, or that the LIBOR Rate
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, Agent
will promptly so notify Administrative Borrower and each Bank. Thereafter, the
obligation of the Banks to make or maintain such LIBOR Loan shall be suspended
until Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Banks) revokes such notice.
Upon receipt of such notice, Administrative Borrower may revoke any pending
request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of such LIBOR Loan or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
borrowing of a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.

     Section 4.1. Conditions to Each Credit Event. The obligation of the Banks

     (n) Miscellaneous. Borrowers shall have provided to Agent and the Banks
such other items and shall have satisfied such other conditions as may be

                              ARTICLE V. COVENANTS

     Section 5.1. Insurance. Each Company shall at all times maintain insurance
upon its Inventory, Equipment and other personal and real property in such form,
written by such companies, in such amounts, for such period, and against such
risks as may be acceptable to Agent, with provisions satisfactory to Agent for
payment of all losses thereunder to Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, and
such Company as their interests may appear (loss payable endorsement in favor of
Agent, for the benefit of the Banks), and, if required. by Agent, Borrowers
shall deposit the policies with Agent. Any such policies of insurance shall
provide for no fewer than thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation
to Agent and the Banks. Any sums received by Agent, for the benefit of the
Banks, in payment of insurance losses, returns, or unearned premiums under the
policies may, at the option of Agent, be applied upon any Debt whether or not
the same is then due and payable, or may be delivered to Borrowers for the
purpose of replacing, repairing, or restoring the insured property. Agent is
hereby authorized to act as attorney-in-fact for each Borrower in obtaining,
adjusting, settling and canceling such insurance and indorsing any drafts. In
the event of failure to provide such insurance as herein provided, Agent may, at
its option, provide such insurance and Borrowers shall pay to Agent, upon
demand, the cost thereof. Should Borrowers fail to pay such sum to Agent upon
demand, interest shall accrue thereon, from the date of demand until paid in
full, at the Default Rate. Within ten days of Agent's written request,
Administrative Borrower shall furnish to Agent such information about any
Company's insurance as Agent may from time to time reasonably request, which
information shall be prepared in form and detail satisfactory to Agent and
certified by a Financial Officer of Administrative Borrower.

     Section 5.2. Money Obligations. Each Company shall pay in full (a) prior in
each case to the date when penalties would attach, all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges and levies (except only those so long as and to the extent
that the same shall be contested in good faith by appropriate and timely
proceedings and for which adequate provisions have been established in
accordance with GAAP) for which it may be or become liable or to which any or
all of its properties may be or become subject; (b) all of its wage obligations

form and substance acceptable to Agent, and (ii) deliver such certificate or
application to Agent and cause the interest of Agent, for the benefit of the

any and all Related Expenses. If any Borrower fails to keep and maintain its
Equipment in good operating condition, Agent may (but shall not be required to)
so maintain or repair all or any part of such Borrower's Equipment and the cost
thereof shall be a Related Expense. All Related Expenses are payable to Agent

to (a) make, directly or indirectly, any Capital Distribution to any Borrower,
(b) make, directly or indirectly, loans or advances or capital contributions to
any Borrower, or (c) transfer or encumber, directly or indirectly, any of the
properties or assets of such Subsidiary to any Borrower; except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) applicable law,
(ii) customary non-assignment provisions in leases or other agreements entered

agreement, mortgage or, as permitted in Section 5.8(b) hereof, lease.

     Section 5.24. Other Covenants. In the event that any Borrower shall enter
into, or shall have entered into, any Material Indebtedness Agreement, wherein

     Section 6.1. Security Interest in Collateral. In consideration of and as
security for the full and complete payment of all of the Secured Debt, each
Borrower hereby grants to Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, a security
interest in and an assignment of the Collateral.

     Section 6.2. Collections and Receipt of Proceeds by Borrowers. Prior to
exercise by Agent and the Banks of their rights under Article IX of this
Agreement, both (a) the lawful collection and enforcement of all of such

of all Proceeds of all of such Borrower's Accounts and Inventory shall be as
agent of the Banks. If any condition or event shall occur after the Closing Date
which the Required Banks determine has had a Material Adverse Effect, upon

opened by Borrowers at the main office of Agent in Cleveland, Ohio, and all such
lawful collections of each Borrower's Accounts and such Proceeds of each
Borrower's Accounts and Inventory shall be remitted daily by such Borrower to
Agent in the form in which they are received by such Borrower, either by mailing
or by delivering such collections and Proceeds to Agent, appropriately endorsed
for deposit in the Cash Collateral Account. In the event that such notice is
given to Borrowers from Agent, no Borrower shall commingle such collections or
Proceeds with any of such Borrower's other funds or property or the funds or
property of any other Borrower, but shall hold such collections and Proceeds
separate and apart therefrom upon an express trust for Agent, for the benefit of
the Banks. In such case, Agent may, in its sole discretion, and shall, at the
request of the Required Banks, at any time and from time to time, apply all or
any portion of the account balance in the Cash Collateral Account as a credit
against (i) the outstanding principal or interest of the Notes, or (ii) any
other Debt. If any remittance shall be dishonored, or if, upon final payment,
any claim with respect thereto shall be made against Agent on its warranties of
collection, Agent may charge the amount of such item against the Cash Collateral
Account or any other Deposit Account maintained by any Borrower with Agent or
with any other Bank, and, in any event, retain the same and such Borrower's
interest therein as additional security for the Secured Debt. Agent may, in its
sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, release funds from the Cash
Collateral Account to Borrowers for use in the business of the Borrowers. The
balance in the

                                       47

Agreement and payment in full of all of the Secured Debt. If any condition or
event shall occur after the Closing Date which the Required Banks determine has
had a Material Adverse Effect, at Agent's direction, each Borrower shall cause
all remittances representing collections and Proceeds of Collateral to be mailed
to a lock box in Cleveland, Ohio, to which Agent shall have access for the
processing of such items in accordance with the provisions, terms and conditions
of Agent's customary lock box agreement.

     Agent, or Agent's designated agent, is hereby constituted and appointed as
each Borrower's attorney-in-fact with authority and power to endorse, any and
all instruments, documents, and chattel paper upon such Borrower's failure to do
so. Such authority and power, being coupled with an interest, shall be (a)
irrevocable until all of the Debt is paid, (b) exercisable by Agent at any time
during which a Cash Collateral Account or lockbox is being maintained pursuant
to this Section 6.2 and without any request upon such Borrower by Agent to so
endorse, and (c) exercisable in Agent's name or such Borrower's name. Each
Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice
of protest, and any and all other similar notices with respect thereto,
regardless of the form of any endorsement thereof. Agent and the Banks shall not
be bound or obligated to take any action to preserve any rights therein against
prior parties thereto.

     Section 6.3. Collections and Receipt of Proceeds by Agent. Each Borrower
hereby constitutes and appoints Agent, or Agent's designated agent, as such
Borrower's attorney-in-fact to exercise, at any time after the occurrence of a
condition or event which the Required Banks determine has had a Material Adverse
Effect, all or any of the following powers which, being coupled with an
interest, shall be irrevocable until the complete and full payment of all of the
Debt:

     (a) to receive, retain, acquire, take, endorse, assign, deliver, accept,
and deposit, in the name of Agent or such Borrower, any and all of such
Borrower's cash, instruments, chattel paper, documents, Proceeds of Accounts,
Proceeds of Inventory, collection of Accounts, and any other writings relating
to any of the Collateral;

     (b) to transmit to Account Debtors, on any or all of such Borrower's
Accounts, notice of assignment to Agent for the benefit of the Banks thereof and
Agent's, for the benefit of the Banks, security interest therein and to request
from such Account Debtors at any time, in the name of Agent or such Borrower,
information concerning such Borrower's Accounts and the amounts owing thereon;

     (c) to transmit to purchasers of any or all of such Borrower's Inventory,
notice of Agent's security interest therein, and to request from such purchasers
at any time, in the name of Agent or such Borrower, information concerning such
Borrower's Inventory and the amounts owing thereon by such purchasers;

     (d) to notify and require Account Debtors on such Borrower's Accounts and
purchasers of such Borrower's Inventory to make payment of their indebtedness
directly to Agent;

                                       48

<PAGE>

     (e) to take or bring, in the name of Agent or such Borrower, all steps,
actions, suits, or proceedings deemed by Agent necessary or desirable to effect
the receipt, enforcement, and collection of the Collateral; and

     (f) to accept all collections in any form relating to the Collateral,
including remittances which may reflect deductions, and to deposit the same,
into such Borrower's Cash Collateral Account or, at the option of Agent, to
apply them as a payment against any Note or Notes or any other Debt.

     Section 6.4. Use of Inventory and Equipment. Until an Event of Default
shall occur, each Borrower may (a) retain possession of and use its Inventory
and Equipment in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Agreement or with
the terms, conditions, or provisions of any policy of insurance thereon; (b)
sell or lease its Inventory in the ordinary course of business; provided,
however, that a sale or lease in the ordinary course of business does not
include a transfer in partial or total satisfaction of an Indebtedness; and (c)
use and consume any raw materials or supplies, the use and consumption of which
are necessary in order to carry on such Borrower's business.

or other governing body, as applicable, and are the valid and binding
obligations of such Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in
accordance with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and performance
of the Loan Documents will not conflict with nor result in any material breach
in any of the provisions of, or constitute a material default under, or result

business of any Company, and there exists no present condition or state of facts
or circumstances that would have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent a Company
from conducting such business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in substantially the same manner in which it was previously conducted.

     Section 7.11. Employee Benefits Plans. Schedule 7.11 hereto identifies each
ERISA Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is expected to occur with respect to
an ERISA Plan. Full payment has been made of all amounts which a Controlled

liability of each Controlled Group member with respect to each ERISA Plan has
been fully funded based upon reasonable and proper actuarial assumptions, has
been fully insured, or has been fully reserved for on its financial statements.
No changes have occurred or are expected to occur that would cause a material
increase in the cost of providing benefits under the ERISA Plan. With respect to

the ERISA Plan and any associated trust operationally comply with the applicable
requirements of Code Section 401(a); (b) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust

Section 401(k), unless the ERISA Plan was first adopted at a time for which the
above-described "remedial amendment period" has not yet expired; (d) the ERISA
Plan currently satisfies the requirements of Code Section 410(b), subject to any
retroactive amendment that may be made within the above-described "remedial

value of Pension Plan assets.

     Section 7.12. Consents or Approvals. No consent, approval or authorization

the reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities that such
Borrower has incurred to Agent and the Banks. No Borrower is insolvent as
defined in any applicable state, federal or relevant foreign statute, nor will
such Borrower be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents to Agent and the Banks. No Borrower is engaged or about to engage in
any business or transaction for which the assets retained by it are or will be
an unreasonably small amount of capital, taking into consideration the
obligations to Agent and the Banks incurred hereunder. No Borrower intends to,
nor does it believe that it will, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature.

     Section 7.14. Financial Statements. The Consolidated financial statements
of MTCT for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the unaudited
Consolidated financial statements of MTCT for the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2002, furnished to Agent and the Banks, are true and complete, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and fairly present the financial condition of
the Companies as of the dates of such financial statements and the results of
their operations for the periods then ending. Since the dates of such
statements, there has been no material adverse change in any Company's financial
condition, properties or business or any change in any Company's accounting
procedures.

     Section 7.15. Regulations. No Company is engaged principally or as one of
its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" (within the meaning of Regulation U of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States of
America). The use of the proceeds of the Loans will not violate, or be
inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation U or X or any other Regulation
of such Board of Governors.

reputable insurers insurance with coverage and limits as required by law and as

Schedule 7.17 hereto sets forth all insurance carried by the Companies on the
Closing Date, setting forth in detail the amount and type of such insurance.

     Section 7.18. Accurate and Complete Statements. Neither the Loan Documents
nor any written statement made by any Company in connection with any of the Loan
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein or in the Loan Documents
not misleading. After due inquiry by Borrowers, there is no known fact that any
Company has not disclosed to Agent and the Banks that has or is likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.19. Defaults. No Default or Event of Default exists hereunder,

                        ARTICLE IX. REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

     Notwithstanding any contrary provision or inference herein or elsewhere,

     Section 9.1. Optional Defaults. If any Event of Default referred to in
Section 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9 or 8.10 hereof shall occur,
Agent may, with the consent of the Required Banks, and shall, at the request of
the Required Banks, give written notice to Borrowers, to:

     (a) terminate the Commitment, if not previously terminated, and,
immediately upon such election, the obligations of the Banks, and each thereof,
to make any further Loan, and/or

     (b) accelerate the maturity of all of the Debt (if the Debt is not already
due and payable), whereupon all of the Debt shall become and thereafter be
immediately due and payable in full without any presentment or demand and
without any further or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived
by Borrowers.

     Section 9.2. Automatic Defaults. If any Event of Default referred to in
Section 8.11 hereof shall occur:

     (a) all of the Commitment shall automatically and immediately terminate, if
not previously terminated, and no Bank thereafter shall be under any obligation
to grant any further Loan, and

     (b) the principal of and interest then outstanding on all of the Notes, and
all of the other Debt, shall thereupon become and thereafter be immediately due
and payable in full (if the Debt is not already due and payable), all without
any presentment, demand or notice of any kind, which are hereby waived by
Borrowers.

     Section 9.3. [RESERVED]

                                       55

<PAGE>

     Section 9.4. Offsets. If there shall occur or exist any Event of Default
referred to in Section 8.11 hereof or if the maturity of the Notes is
accelerated pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof, each Bank shall have the
right at any time to set off against, and to appropriate and apply toward the
payment of, any and all Debt then owing by Borrowers to such Bank (including,
without limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to
Section 2.4(c) or 9.4 hereof), whether or not the same shall then have matured,
any and all deposit (general or special) balances and all other indebtedness
then held or owing by such Bank (including, without limitation, by branches and
agencies or any affiliate of such Bank) to or for the credit or account of any
Borrower or Guarantor of Payment, all without notice to or demand upon any
Borrower or any other Person, all such notices and demands being hereby
expressly waived by each Borrower.

     Section 9.5. Equalization Provision. Each Bank agrees with the other Banks
that if it, at any time, shall obtain any Advantage over the other Banks or any
thereof in respect of the Debt (except as to Swing Loans prior to Agent's giving
of notice to participate and except under Article III hereof), it shall purchase
from the other Banks, for cash and at par, such additional participation in the
Debt as shall be necessary to nullify the Advantage. If any such Advantage
resulting in the purchase of an additional participation as aforesaid shall be
recovered in whole or in part from the Bank receiving the Advantage, each such
purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price restored (but without
interest unless the Bank receiving the Advantage is required to pay interest on
the Advantage to the Person recovering the Advantage from such Bank) ratably to
the extent of the recovery. Each Bank further agrees with the other Banks that
if it at any time shall receive any payment for or on behalf of any Borrower on
any indebtedness owing by any Borrower to that Bank (whether by voluntary
payment, by realization upon security, by reason of offset of any deposit or
other indebtedness, by counterclaim or cross-action, by the enforcement of any
right under any Loan Document, or otherwise) it will apply such payment first to
any and all Debt owing by such Borrower to that Bank (including, without
limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to this
Section or any other Section of this Agreement). Each Borrower agrees that any
Bank so purchasing a participation from the other Banks or any thereof pursuant
to this Section may exercise all of its rights of payment (including the right
of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank was a
direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     Section 9.6. Collateral. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and at
all times thereafter, Agent, on behalf of the Required Banks, shall have the
rights and remedies of a secured party under the Ohio Revised Code as in effect
from time to time, in addition to the rights and remedies of a secured party
provided elsewhere within this Agreement, in any other Related Writing executed
by any Borrower or otherwise provided in law or equity. Agent may require
Borrowers to assemble the Collateral, which Borrowers agree to do, and make it
available to Agent and the Banks at a reasonably convenient place to be
designated by Agent. Agent may, with or without notice to or demand upon
Borrowers and with or without the aid of legal process, make use of such force
as may be necessary to enter any premises where the Collateral, or any thereof,
may be found and to take possession thereof (including anything found in or on
the Collateral that is not specifically described in this Agreement, each of
which findings shall be considered to be an accession to and a part of the
Collateral) and for that purpose may pursue the Collateral wherever the same may
be found, without liability for trespass or

                                       56

<PAGE>

damage caused thereby to Borrowers. After any delivery or taking of possession
of the Collateral, or any thereof, pursuant to this Agreement, then, with or
without resort to Borrowers personally or any other Person or property, all of
which Borrowers hereby waive, and upon such terms and in such manner as Agent
may deem advisable, Agent, in its discretion, may sell, assign, transfer and
deliver any of the Collateral at any time, or from time to time. No prior notice
need be given to Borrowers or to any other Person in the case of any sale of
Collateral that Agent determines to be perishable or to be declining speedily in
value or that is customarily sold in any recognized market, but in any other
case Agent shall give Borrowers not fewer than ten days prior notice of either
the time and place of any public sale of the Collateral or of the time after
which any private sale or other intended disposition thereof is to be made.
Borrowers waive advertisement of any such sale and (except to the extent
specifically required by the preceding sentence) waive notice of any kind in
respect of any such sale. At any such public sale, Agent or the Banks may
purchase the Collateral, or any part thereof, free from any right of redemption,
all of which rights Borrowers hereby waive and release. After deducting all
Related Expenses, and after paying all claims, if any, secured by Liens having
precedence over this Agreement, Agent may apply the net proceeds of each such
sale to or toward the payment of the Debt, whether or not then due, in such
order and by such division as Agent, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable.
Any excess, to the extent permitted by law, shall be paid to Borrowers, and
Borrowers shall remain liable for any deficiency. In addition, Agent shall at
all times have the right to obtain appraisals of Borrowers or the Collateral,
the cost of which shall be paid by Borrowers.

     Section 9.7. Other Remedies. The remedies in this Article IX are in
addition to, not in limitation of, any other right, power, privilege, or remedy,
either in law, in equity, or otherwise, to which the Banks may be entitled.
Agent shall exercise the rights under this Article IX and all other collection
efforts on behalf of the Banks and no Bank shall act independently with respect
thereto, except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement.

                              ARTICLE X. THE AGENT

     The Banks authorize National City Bank and National City Bank hereby agrees
to act as agent for the Banks in respect of this Agreement upon the terms and
conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, and upon the following terms
and conditions:

     Section 10.1. Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers hereunder as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Neither Agent
nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, attorneys or employees shall be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or in
connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Neither Agent nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers,
attorneys or employees shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its or their
own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be responsible in any manner to
any of the Banks for the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or
due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, (b) be under any

                                       57

<PAGE>

obligation to any of the Banks to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance
or observance or any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or thereof on
the part of Borrowers, or the financial condition of Borrowers, or (c) be liable
to any of the Companies for consequential damages resulting from any breach of
contract, tort or other wrong in connection with the negotiation, documentation,
administration or collection of the Loans or any of the Loan Documents.

     Section 10.2. Note Holders. Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with it,
signed by such payee and in form and substance satisfactory to Agent.

     Section 10.3. Consultation with Counsel. Agent may consult with legal
counsel selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered
in good faith by it in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

     Section 10.4. Documents. Agent shall not be under any duty to examine into
or pass upon the validity, effectiveness, genuineness or value of any Loan
Document or any other Related Writing furnished pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith or the value of any collateral obtained hereunder, and Agent shall be
entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine and what they
purport to be.

     Section 10.5. Agent and Affiliates. With respect to the Loans, Agent shall
have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the
same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with
any Company or any Affiliate.

     Section 10.6. Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and agreed
that Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred, unless Agent has been notified by a Bank in writing that such Bank
believes that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
specifying the nature thereof or has been notified by a Borrower pursuant to
Section 5.14 hereof.

     Section 10.7. Action by Agent. Subject to the other terms and conditions
hereof, so long as Agent shall be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.6 hereof, to
assume that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Agent shall be entitled to use its discretion with respect to
exercising or refraining from exercising any rights that may be vested in it by,
or with respect to taking or refraining from taking any action or actions that
it may be able to take under or in respect of, this Agreement. Agent shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
certificate, warranty or other paper or instrument believed by it to be genuine
or authentic or to be signed by the proper party or parties, or with respect to
anything that it may do or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its
judgment, or that may seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the premises.

     Section 10.8. Default Notices. In the event that Agent shall have acquired
actual knowledge of any Default or Event of Default, Agent shall promptly notify
the Banks and shall take such action and assert such rights under this Agreement
as the Required Banks shall direct

                                       58

<PAGE>

and Agent shall inform the other Banks in writing of the action taken. Agent may
take such action and assert such rights as it deems to be advisable, in its
discretion, for the protection of the interests of the holders of the Notes.

     Section 10.9. Indemnification of Agent. The Banks agree to indemnify Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers) ratably, according to their
respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in its capacity as agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any action
taken or omitted by Agent with respect to this Agreement or any Loan Document,
provided that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees) or disbursements resulting from Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or from any action taken or omitted by Agent in any capacity other
than as agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     Section 10.10. Successor Agent. Agent may resign as agent hereunder by
giving not fewer than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Borrowers and the
Banks. If Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required
Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks (with
the consent of Administrative Borrower so long as an Event of Default has not
occurred and which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), or (b) if a
successor agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30)
day period following Agent's notice to the Banks of its resignation, then Agent
shall appoint a successor agent that shall serve as agent until such time as the
Required Banks appoint a successor agent. Upon its appointment, such successor
agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties as agent, and the term
"Agent" shall mean such successor effective upon its appointment, and the former
agent's rights, powers and duties as agent shall be terminated without any other
or further act or deed on the part of such former agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement.

                            ARTICLE XI. MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 11.1. Banks' Independent Investigation. Each Bank, by its signature
to this Agreement, acknowledges and agrees that Agent has made no representation
or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the creditworthiness, financial
condition, or any other condition of any Company or with respect to the
statements contained in any information memorandum furnished in connection
herewith or in any other oral or written communication between Agent and such
Bank. Each Bank represents that it has made and shall continue to make its own
independent investigation of the creditworthiness, financial condition and
affairs of the Companies in connection with the extension of credit hereunder,
and agrees that Agent has no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any credit or other information with
respect thereto (other than such notices as may be expressly required to be
given by Agent to the Banks hereunder), whether coming into its possession
before the first Credit Event hereunder or at any time or times thereafter.

                                       59

<PAGE>

     Section 11.2. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No omission or course of
dealing on the part of Agent, any Bank or the holder of any Note in exercising
any right, power or remedy hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder or under any of the
Loan Documents. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and in addition to
any other rights, powers or privileges held by operation of law, by contract or
otherwise.

     Section 11.3. Amendments, Consents. No amendment, modification,
termination, or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document nor consent to any
variance therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Required Banks and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, unanimous consent of the Banks
shall be required with respect to (a) any increase in the Commitment hereunder
(except as specified in Section 2.11(b) hereof), (b) the extension of maturity
of the Notes, the payment date of interest or principal thereunder, or the
payment of commitment or other fees or amounts payable hereunder, (c) any
reduction in the rate of interest on the Notes, or in any amount of principal or
interest due on any Note, or the payment of commitment or other fees hereunder
or any change in the manner of pro rata application of any payments made by
Borrowers to the Banks hereunder, (d) any change in any percentage voting
requirement, voting rights, or the Required Banks definition in this Agreement,
(e) the release of any Borrower or Guarantor of Payment or of any collateral in
excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) securing the Debt or any part
thereof, or (f) any amendment to this Section 11.3 or Section 9.5 hereof. Notice
of amendments or consents ratified by the Banks hereunder shall be forwarded by
Agent to all of the Banks.

     Section 11.4. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and, if to a Borrower,
mailed or delivered to it, addressed to it at the address specified on the
signature pages of this Agreement, if to a Bank, mailed or delivered to it,
addressed to the address of such Bank specified on the signature pages of this
Agreement, or, as to each party, at such other address as shall be designated by
such party in a written notice to each of the other parties. All notices,
statements, requests, demands and other communications provided for hereunder
shall be deemed to be given or made (i) when delivered or two Business Days
after being deposited in the mails with postage prepaid by registered or
certified mail, addressed as aforesaid, or (ii) when sent by facsimile with
telephonic confirmation of receipt, except that notices from a Borrower to Agent
or the Banks pursuant to any of the provisions hereof shall not be effective
until received by Agent or the Banks, as the case may be.

     Section 11.5. Costs, Expenses and Taxes. Borrowers agree to pay on demand
all reasonable costs and expenses of Agent, including but not limited to, (a)
Related Expenses, (b) syndication, administration, travel and out-of-pocket
expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees and expenses, of Agent in
connection with the preparation, negotiation and closing of the Loan Documents
and the administration of the Loan Documents, the collection and disbursement of
all funds hereunder and the other instruments and documents to be delivered
hereunder, (c) extraordinary expenses of Agent in connection with the
administration of the Loan

                                       60

<PAGE>

Documents and the other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, and
(d) the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of special counsel for Agent, with
respect to the foregoing, and of local counsel, if any, who may be retained by
said special counsel with respect thereto. Borrowers also agree to pay on demand
all reasonable costs and expenses of Agent and the Banks, including attorneys'
fees, in connection with the restructuring or enforcement of the Debt, this
Agreement or any Related Writing. In addition, Borrowers shall pay any and all
stamp and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in connection
with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and the other instruments
and documents to be delivered hereunder, and agree to hold Agent and each Bank
harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting
from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes or fees.

     Section 11.6. Indemnification. Each Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Agent and the Banks (and their respective affiliates,
officers, directors, attorneys, agents and employees) from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments and
suits of any kind or nature whatsoever (together with all reasonable costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees, and disbursements, incurred or made by
Agent or any Bank in relation thereto) that may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against Agent or any Bank, or any affiliate thereof, in connection with
(a) any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not
Agent or such Bank, or any affiliate thereof, shall be designated a party
thereto), or (b) any claim by any Person relating to or arising out of any Loan
Document or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of the Loans or any of the
Debt, or any activities of any Company or its Affiliates; provided that no Bank
nor Agent shall have the right to be indemnified under this Section 11.6 for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. All obligations provided for in this Section 11.6 shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

     Section 11.7. Obligations Several; No Fiduciary Obligations. The
obligations of the Banks hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing contained
in this Agreement and no action taken by Agent or the Banks pursuant hereto
shall be deemed to constitute Agent or the Banks a partnership, association,
joint venture or other entity. No default by any Bank hereunder shall excuse the
other Banks from any obligation under this Agreement; but no Bank shall have or
acquire any additional obligation of any kind by reason of such default. The
relationship among Borrowers, Agent and the Banks with respect to the Loan
Documents and the Related Writings is and shall be solely that of debtors and
creditors, respectively, and neither Agent nor any Bank shall have any fiduciary
obligation toward any Credit Party with respect to any such documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

     Section 11.8. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the
same agreement.

     Section 11.9. Binding Effect; Borrowers' Assignment. This Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by each Borrower, Agent and
each Bank and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each
Borrower, Agent and each of the

                                       61

<PAGE>

Banks and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower shall
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of Agent and all of the Banks.

     Section 11.10. Bank Assignments.

     (a) Assignments of Commitments. Each Bank shall have the right at any time
or times to assign to an Eligible Transferee (other than to a Bank that shall
not be in compliance with this Agreement or to a Borrower or an Affiliate of a
Company), without recourse, all or a percentage of all of the following: (i)
such Bank's Commitment, (ii) all Loans made by that Bank, (iii) such Bank's
Notes, and (iv) such Bank's interest in any Swing Loan, and any participation
purchased pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or 9.5 hereof.

     (b) Prior Consent. No assignment may be consummated pursuant to this
Section 11.10 without the prior written consent of Administrative Borrower and
Agent (other than an assignment by any Bank to another Bank or to any affiliate
of such Bank which affiliate is either wholly-owned by a Bank or is wholly-owned
by a Person that wholly owns, either directly or indirectly, such Bank), which
consent of Administrative Borrowers and Agent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that, Administrative Borrower's consent shall not
be required if, at the time of the proposed assignment, any Default or Event of
Default shall then exist. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any
Bank may at any time make a collateral assignment of all or any portion of its
rights under the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, and no such
assignment shall release such assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

     (c) Minimum Amount. Each such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of
the lesser of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of the assignor's Commitment and
interest herein, or the entire amount of the assignor's Commitment and interest
herein.

     (d) Assignment Fee. Unless the assignment shall be to an affiliate of the
assignor or the assignment shall be due to merger of the assignor or for
regulatory purposes, either the assignor or the assignee shall remit to Agent,
for its own account, an administrative fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($3,500).

     (e) Assignment Agreement. Unless the assignment shall be due to merger of
the assignor or a collateral assignment for regulatory purposes, the assignor
shall (i) cause the assignee to execute and deliver to Administrative Borrower
and Agent an Assignment Agreement, and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause the
assignee to execute and deliver, as the case may be, to Agent such additional
amendments, assurances and other writings as Agent may reasonably require.

     (f) Non-U.S. Assignee. If the assignment is to be made to an assignee that
is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or
any state thereof, the assignor Bank shall cause such assignee, at least five
Business Days prior to the effective date of such assignment, (i) to represent
to the assignor Bank (for the benefit of the assignor Bank, Agent and Borrowers)
that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be

                                       62

<PAGE>

withheld by Agent, Borrowers or the assignor with respect to any payments to be
made to such assignee in respect of the Loans hereunder, (ii) to furnish to the
assignor (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the Register (as
defined below), Agent and Borrowers) either (A) U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or (B) United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9, as applicable (wherein such assignee claims entitlement to complete
exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder),
and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the assignor, Agent and Borrowers) to
provide to the assignor Bank (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the
Register, to Agent and Borrowers) a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN or Form W-8
or W-9, as applicable, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously
delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws
and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such assignee, and
to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with
regard to such withholding tax exemption.

     (g) Deliveries by Borrowers. Upon satisfaction of all applicable
requirements specified in subsections (a) through (f) above, Borrowers shall
execute and deliver (i) to Agent, the assignor and the assignee, any consent or
release (of all or a portion of the obligations of the assignor) required to be
delivered by Borrowers in connection with the Assignment Agreement, and (ii) to
the assignee and the assignor, if applicable, an appropriate Note or Notes.
After delivery of the new Note or Notes, the assignor's Note or Notes being
replaced shall be returned to Borrowers marked "replaced".

     (h) Effect of Assignment. Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements
set forth in subsections (a) through (g) above, and any other condition
contained in this Section 11.10, (i) the assignee shall become and thereafter be
deemed to be a "Bank" for the purposes of this Agreement, (ii) the Assignor
shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the extent that its interest
has been assigned, (iii) in the event that the assignor's entire interest has
been assigned, the assignor shall cease to be and thereafter shall no longer
be deemed to be a "Bank", and (iv) the signature pages hereto and Schedule 1
hereto shall be automatically amended, without further action, to reflect the
result of any such assignment.

     (i) Agent to Maintain Register. Agent shall maintain at the address for
notices referred to in Section 11.4 hereof a copy of each Assignment Agreement
delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, in the absence of demonstrable error, and Borrowers, Agent and
the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the
owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any Bank at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     Section 11.11. Sale of Participations. Any Bank may, in the ordinary course
of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell participations to one or more Eligible Transferees or an affiliate of
such Bank (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement and the other

                                       63

<PAGE>

Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of the
Commitment and the Loans and participations owing to it and the Note held by
it); provided, that:

     (a) any such Bank's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged;

     (b) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
for the performance of such obligations;

     (c) the parties hereto shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement
and each of the other Loan Documents;

     (d) such Participant shall be bound by the provisions of Section 9.5
hereof, and the Bank selling such participation shall obtain from such
Participant a written confirmation of its agreement to be so bound; and

     (e) no Participant (unless such Participant is itself a Bank) shall be
entitled to require such Bank to take or refrain from taking action under this
Agreement or under any other Loan Document, except that such Bank may agree with
such Participant that such Bank will not, without such Participant's consent,
take action of the type described as follows:

          (i) increase the portion of the participation amount of any
     Participant over the amount thereof then in effect, or extend the
     Commitment Period, without the written consent of each Participant affected
     thereby; or

          (ii) reduce the principal amount of or extend the time for any payment
     of principal of any Loan, or reduce the rate of interest or extend the time

Loan Document or other agreement, document or instrument attached hereto or

mentioned herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral representations and

hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such Ohio state or federal court. Each
Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue in any action or proceeding in any such court as
well as any right it may now or hereafter have to remove such action or
proceeding, once commenced, to another court on the grounds of FORUM NON
CONVENIENS or otherwise. The parties hereto each agree that a final,
nonappealable judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.

$_____________________                                              Dayton, Ohio
                                                                January 31, 2003

     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, MTC TECHNOLOGIES, INC., and MODERN
TECHNOLOGIES CORP. (collectively, "Borrowers" and, individually, each a
"Borrower"), jointly and severally, promise to pay, on the last day of the
Commitment Period, as defined in the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined),
to the order of _______________________ ("Bank") at the main office
of NATIONAL CITY BANK, as Agent, as hereinafter defined, 1900 East 9th Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44114-3484, the principal sum of
________________________________________________________________________ DOLLARS

or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans made by Bank to
Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Credit Agreement, whichever is less, in
lawful money of the United States of America.

     As used herein, "Credit Agreement" means the Credit and Security Agreement
dated as of January 31, 2003, among Borrowers, the Banks, as defined therein,
and National City Bank, as lead arranger and administrative agent for the Banks
("Agent"), as the same may from time to time be amended, restated or otherwise
modified. Each capitalized term used herein that is defined in the Credit
Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it
in the Credit Agreement.

     Borrowers also promise to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Revolving Loan from time to time outstanding, from the date of such
Revolving Loan until the payment in full thereof, at the rates per annum that
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5 of the
Credit Agreement. Such interest shall be payable on each date provided for in
such Section 2.5; provided, however, that interest on any principal portion that
is not paid when due shall be payable on demand.

     The portions of the principal sum hereof from time to time representing
Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans, and payments of principal of any thereof, shall
be shown on the records of Bank by such method as Bank may generally employ;
provided, however, that failure to make any such entry shall in no way detract
from the obligations of Borrowers under this Note.

     If this Note shall not be paid at maturity, whether such maturity occurs by
reason of lapse of time or by operation of any provision for acceleration of
maturity contained in the Credit Agreement, the principal hereof and the unpaid
interest thereon shall bear interest, until paid, at a rate per annum equal to
the Default Rate. All payments of principal of and interest on this Note shall
be made in immediately available funds. In the event of a failure to pay
interest or principal, when the same becomes due, Bank may collect and Borrowers
agree to pay a late

                                       A-1

<PAGE>

charge of an amount equal to the greater of (a) ten percent (10%) of the amount
of such late payment, or (b) Twenty-Five Dollars ($25).

     This Note is one of the Revolving Credit Notes referred to in the Credit
Agreement. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement for a description of the
right of the undersigned to anticipate payments hereof, the right of the holder
hereof to declare this Note due prior to its stated maturity, and other terms
and conditions upon which this Note is issued.

     Except as expressly provided in the Credit Agreement, Borrowers expressly
waive presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind.

     Each of the undersigned, to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives any
right to have a jury participate in resolving any dispute, whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise, between the undersigned (or any of them) and the
holder of this Note arising out of, in connection with, related to, or
incidental to the relationship established between them in connection with this
Note and the Credit Agreement or the transactions related thereto.
