<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of November&nbsp;22, 2002, by and between STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and [NAME OF DIRECTOR] ("Director"). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as
directors or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out
of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals as
members of the Board, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain
liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that,
given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors are being increasingly
subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to the business and affairs of corporations. The Company recognizes that the cost of defending and otherwise participating in
such litigation is far greater than the financial benefits of serving as a Director. The Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL")
expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive and contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board with respect
to indemnification; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the uncertainties relating to insurance have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining directors; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining directors is detrimental to the best interests
of the Company's stockholders; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to pay expenses on
behalf of directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, this Agreement is in furtherance of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, its Bylaws and any resolutions adopted
pursuant thereto, and the DGCL, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Director thereunder; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the Company has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Director to serve
as a director or officer of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Director is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director or officer of the Company; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Director is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the
condition that he be so indemnified; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>NOW, THEREFORE,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> in consideration of the promises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Director do hereby covenant and agree
as follows: </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to the Company.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director will serve or continue to serve, at the will of the Company
and its stockholders for so long as Director is duly elected or appointed or until Director tenders his or her resignation.

shall constitute the Director's agreement that: (i)&nbsp;he shall repay the Expenses paid by the Company to the extent that it is ultimately determined by final judicial decision from which there is
no further right to appeal that the Director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company; and (ii)&nbsp;that in consideration for the payment of such expenses, the Company may, at its sole

of this Agreement. Such payment shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of payment of Expenses, including Expenses incurred preparing and
forwarding statements to the Company to support the payment claimed. This Section&nbsp;9 shall not apply to any claim for Expenses made by Director for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section&nbsp;9, to the extent that the Company is prohibited by applicable law from making payment of Expenses to the Director prior
to the Company's determination that the Director is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall not pay Expenses to the Director pursuant to this Section. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit
the Company's right to seek damages from the Director, including but not limited to the full amount of the Expenses paid by the Company hereunder. The selection by the Company of defense counsel for

of the Company's election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Director and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Director
under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Director with respect to the same Proceeding, provided that (i)&nbsp;Director shall have the right to employ his counsel in any
such Proceeding at Director's expense; and (ii)&nbsp;if (A)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Director has been previously authorized by the Company, (B)&nbsp;Director shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Director in the conduct of any such defense, or (C)&nbsp;the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume
the defense of such Proceeding, then the fees and expenses of Director's counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. </FONT></P>

final disposition of a Proceeding for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 or Section&nbsp;4, Director shall submit promptly (and in any

indemnification made under this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 or Section&nbsp;4 shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the Director is proper in the circumstances because Director has met the applicable standard of conduct. Such determination shall be made in the following manner: (i)&nbsp;if a

the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel

indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(a), (unless Director shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Director shall give
written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Director or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after
such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Director, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however,  </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>that such objection may be
asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in
Section&nbsp;2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. The objection must also include a proposed substitute Independent Counsel.
If objection including a proposed substituted
Independent Counsel is timely made, such substituted Independent Counsel shall serve as Independent Counsel unless objected to within ten (10)&nbsp;days. An objection to the substituted Independent
Counsel may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section&nbsp;2 of this Agreement, and the
objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If written objection is made, the Independent Counsel or substituted Independent Counsel proposed may not serve as
Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after submission by Director of a
written request for indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(a) hereof, the parties have not agreed upon the selection of the Independent Counsel, either the Company or Director may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Director to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as
Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so

such indemnification under applicable law. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action
pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Director has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its
directors or Independent Counsel) that Director has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Director has not met the applicable

entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the
