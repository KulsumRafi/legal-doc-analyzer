<FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of this Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is to ensure the payment of a competitive level of Retirement income in order to attract, retain and motivate selected executives.  The Plan is designed to provide a benefit which, when added to other Retirement income of the executive, will meet the objective described above.  Eligibility for participation in the plan shall be limited to executives who are classified as directors or above, who are participants in the Conectiv Deferred Income Plan, and other managers or executive who are selected by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  In order to be eligible for benefits under this Plan on account of Service prior to employment by an Employer, an executive must be (or have been) recruited into the position (or for the position) as determined by the Committee.  This Plan is a successor to the Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Atlantic City Electric Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan - II, and Excess Benefit Retirement Income Program.  This Plan is effective January 1, 1999, and is effective as to each Participant on the date he or she is designated as such hereunder.<BR>

In the event the Participant's retirement was caused by the Participant's disability or involuntary termination of employment and was, in the judgment of the Committee, unanticipated, the Participant's separate election shall be given effect even if it was executed fewer than six months prior to his Retirement Date or in the same calendar year, so long as it was executed before the Participant reasonably could be deemed to have anticipated the timing of his retirement.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit payable in the form of a lump sum shall be the greater of (i) the SERP Payable Cash Balance, or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent of the minimum or grandfathered benefit as defined in Section 3.2.  The benefit payable in the form of an annuity shall be the greater of (i) the SERP Payable Cash Balance converted to an annuity pursuant to the provisions of the Basic Plan, or (ii) the minimum or grandfathered benefit as defined in Section 3.2, subject to any adjustments or actuarial reductions as set forth in the Basic Plan for benefits payable prior to Normal Retirement Date or in any form other than a single life annuity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may make appropriate adjustments to the benefits payable under the Plan to reflect the timing and form of payments of any Other Retirement Income.<BR>

However, no amendment or suspension of the Plan will affect a retired Participant's right or the right of a Surviving Spouse to continue to receive a benefit in accordance with this Plan as in effect on the date such Participant commenced to receive a benefit under this Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Limitation of Participant's Right</U>.  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as conferring upon any Participant any right to continue in the employment of the Employer, nor shall it interfere with the rights of the Employer or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any Participant and/or to take any personnel action affecting any Participant without regard to the effect which such action may have upon such Participant as a recipient or prospective recipient of benefits under the Plan.  Any amounts payable hereunder shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to a Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which the Participant may be entitled under any other arrangement established by the Employer for the benefit of its employees.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any Affiliate from taking any action which is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest.  No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any Affiliate as a result of such action.<BR>

Any agreement entered into by the Employer and an employee who is from a select group of management or highly compensated employees which provides individually negotiated benefits to such employee which are not otherwise described in the Plan shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference hereunder.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Taxes</U>.  The Company may make such provisions and take such action as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which the Company is required by any law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether Federal, state or local, to withhold in connection with any benefits under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the withholding of appropriate sums from any amount otherwise payable to the Participant (or his Beneficiary).  Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such benefits.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Unfunded Status of Plan</U>.  The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan of deferred compensation for Participants.  Benefits payable hereunder shall be payable out of the general assets of the Company, and no segregation of any assets whatsoever for such benefits shall be made.  Notwithstanding any segregation of assets or transfer to a grantor trust, with respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights to assets that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.<BR>

If a Participant becomes entitled to a distribution of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Company or any Employer or Affiliate, then the Company, Employer, or Affiliate may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable.  Such determination shall be made by the Committee.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, no benefit under this Plan otherwise shall be assignable or subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, claims of creditors, pledge, attachment or encumbrances of any kind, other than a qualified domestic relations order that is otherwise enforceable against the Plan and not preempted by ERISA.<BR>

In the event distribution continues to be deferred under the terms of the Plan, the affected Employer shall be required to contribute cash or equivalent assets to a grantor trust (maintained by an institutional trustee independent of the Employer) within 60 days after such Change in Control, in an amount not less than the then-current value of all Participant benefits related to such Employer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law.</U>  This plan is established under and will be construed according to ERISA and, where not preempted, the laws of the State of Delaware.<BR>
