York, APL Ohio and APL Pennsylvania, collectively, the "Guarantors" and the
Borrower and the Guarantors collectively, the " Obligors"); each of the lenders
that is a signatory hereto (individually, together with its successors and
assigns, a "Lender" and, collectively, the "Lenders"); WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, together
with its successors in such capacity the "Administrative Agent"), and as issuing

         A. The parties hereto are parties to the Credit Agreement dated
December 27, 2002 (the " Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the Lenders
agreed to loan up to $7,500,000 to Borrower.


         B. The Credit Agreement was amended by that certain First Amendment to
Credit Agreement dated January 31, 2003 (the "First Amendment"), pursuant to
which the Lenders agreed to loan up to $10,000,000 to Borrower (the Credit
Agreement as amended by the First Amendment is herein called the "Original
Agreement").

         C. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Amendment Wachovia
Bank, National Association, as Lender, has assigned to KeyBank National
Association under that certain Assignment Agreement of even date herewith (the
"Assignment Agreement") fifty percent (50%) of Wachovia Bank, National
Association's Percentage Share of the Revolving Credit Commitment (the "Assigned

an "Augmenting Lender."

         D. Borrower has requested, pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Original
Agreement, the Maximum Revolving Credit Amount be increased to $15,000,000 and
KeyBank National Association, as Augmenting Lender, the other Lenders and the
Administrative Agent consent to amend the Original Agreement in order to modify
certain provisions of the Original Agreement pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and intending to be
legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

         subsection (m) immediately after subsection (l):

                  (d) Annex I attached to the Original Agreement is deleted in
         its entirety and Annex I attached hereto is substituted in lieu
         thereof.
