personal services of its officers and management, expressed intention to deal
fairly with the consuming public and with Porsche, representations made in
application materials submitted to Porsche, and promise to adhere to the terms
and conditions herein. Likewise, DEALER enters into this Agreement in reliance
upon Porsche's promise to adhere to the terms and conditions herein. Porsche and
DEALER shall refrain from conduct which may be detrimental to or adversely
reflect upon the reputation of PORSCHE AG, Porsche, DEALER or PORSCHE PRODUCTS
in general. The parties acknowledge that the success of the relationship between

law, to appoint other authorized Porsche dealers at any locality of Porsche's
choice.

                         SECTION II. OWNERSHIP OF DEALER

         This Agreement requires the personal services of the owners and
management of DEALER, and has been entered into by Porsche in reliance upon, and
in consideration of, DEALER's representation that only the persons named herein
are the Owner(s) and General Manager of DEALER, that such persons will serve in
the capacities indicated, and that such persons are committed to achieving the
purposes, goals and commitments of this Agreement.

         DEALER represents that only the following persons have an actual or
beneficial ownership interest in DEALER and that their ownership interests are
as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         NAME              ADDRESS              TITLE        OWNERSHIP
                                                             INTEREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



                        SECTION III. MANAGEMENT OF DEALER

         DEALER has nominated ______________________________ to serve as on-site
General Manager of the dealership. Porsche and DEALER agree that the retention
of qualified management is of critical importance to satisfy the commitments
made by DEALER in this Agreement. DEALER agrees that its General Manager and no
other person, will exercise the function of General Manager, shall be involved
on a full-time basis in the dealership's day-





                                       3

<PAGE>


to-day operations and shall have full managerial authority to make all operating
decisions for DEALER. DEALER further agrees that the General Manager shall
devote his or her full efforts to DEALER's operations.

         Relying on the personal qualifications and automotive business
experience of __________________________ and the representations with respect
thereto, and further relying on the agreement of DEALER as set forth herein,
Porsche accepts DEALER's nomination of _____________________________________ as
General Manager.

                     SECTION IV. CHANGES IN DEALER OWNERSHIP
                                  OR MANAGEMENT

         As this is a personal services Agreement, DEALER agrees that no changes
in DEALER's owners or General Manager shall be made without Porsche's prior
written consent. DEALER shall give Porsche a minimum of ninety (90) day's prior
written notice of any proposed change in the ownership of DEALER and/or the
General Manager. Porsche shall have the right, subject to applicable law, to
withhold consent to any such proposed change should Porsche determine that any
successor owner or General Manager fails to possess the personal qualifications,
automotive business experience, and financial strength considered by Porsche to
be necessary to successfully fulfill DEALER's obligations under this Agreement.
DEALER agrees that until such time as it receives Porsche's written consent to
any proposed change in ownership or General Manager, DEALER will take no action
to complete the proposed change.

                                       4
<PAGE>

         If DEALER is a corporate entity, DEALER agrees to include and maintain
in its stock subscription agreements or other agreement with all its
stockholders, a provision restricting the ability of stockholders to transfer
stock without DEALER's prior written approval. DEALER agrees to provide a copy
of such agreement(s) to Porsche upon request.

         This is a personal service contract. Porsche has entered into this
Agreement because DEALER has represented to Porsche that the Owners and General
Manager of DEALER identified herein possess the personal qualifications, skill
and commitment necessary to ensure that DEALER will promote, sell and service
PORSCHE PRODUCTS in the most effective manner. Because Porsche has entered into
this Agreement in reliance upon these representations and DEALER's assurances of
the active involvement of such persons in DEALER operations, any
misrepresentations with respect to these matters is grounds to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section L of this Agreement, and any change in Ownership,
no matter what the share or relationship between parties, or any changes in
General Manager from the person specified herein, requires the prior written
consent of Porsche, which consent Porsche shall not unreasonably withhold.

         DEALER agrees that factors which would make Porsche's withholding of
consent reasonable include, without limitation, Porsche's determination that a
new Owner or General Manager did not have adequate or satisfactory financial
capability (if applicable) and experience and success in the automobile
dealership business.

any Approved Location(s), or otherwise use such Approved Location(s) for any
functions other than the approved functions, without the prior written consent
of Porsche.

services.

5.       DELAYS IN PORSCHE PRODUCT DELIVERIES

         Porsche shall not be liable, in any respect, for failures or delays in

in part, to matters beyond Porsche's control including, but not limited to, acts
of God, strikes, lockouts, embargoes, transportation delays, any law, regulation
or action of any governmental entity, foreign or civil wars, riots, interruption
of navigation, or the delays or failure of PORSCHE AG or its suppliers to

6.       DIVERSION CHARGES

         If Porsche is required to divert any PORSCHE PRODUCTS ordered by DEALER

against any transportation carrier for damage to PORSCHE PRODUCTS shipped

upon delivery to DEALER, and/or to promptly notify Porsche of any deficiency or
damage shall constitute a waiver by DEALER of Porsche's obligations to process
any claim, and DEALER shall be solely responsible for asserting and processing
any such claim against the transportation carrier.

         To the extent required by Porsche's established policies and procedures

issued from time to time thereunder, and all other applicable federal, state,
and local motor vehicle safety and emission control statutes, rules, and

require motor vehicle dealers or distributors to install in new or used motor
vehicles, prior to their retail sale, any safety devices or other equipment not

the sale of any Porsche vehicle on which such installations are required, shall

reporting of such equipment. Porsche agrees to pay DEALER for all parts and/or

         and regulations, DEALER agrees to provide prompt notice to Porsche of
         such complaints and take such other steps as Porsche may reasonably
         require. DEALER will do nothing to affect adversely Porsche's rights
         under such laws and regulations.

                                      -23-
<PAGE>




         b.       bodily injury or property damage caused solely by an alleged
defect in design, manufacture, or assembly of a PORSCHE PRODUCT, except for any
manufacturing defect in tires sold by Porsche to DEALER, provided that the
defect could not have been discovered by DEALER during the pre-delivery
inspection required by Section D (2) of this Agreement;

         c.       any misrepresentations or unfair or deceptive trade practices
of Porsche;

         d.       any substantial damage to a PORSCHE PRODUCT repaired by
Porsche or PORSCHE AG prior to the delivery to DEALER, its agent, or designated
carrier for transportation

         Porsche shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify, or hold DEALER
harmless if:

         a.       DEALER fails to provide Porsche with written notification
within thirty (30) days of the assertion of such claim or the commencement of
litigation against DEALER, or within thirty (30) days of discovery of facts
giving rise to indemnification, which ever is sooner, and to provide copies of
any pleadings which have been served, together with all information then
available, regarding the circumstances giving rise to the action or litigation;

         b.       the claim or litigation alleges DEALER misconduct, including
but not limited to, improper or unsatisfactory service or repair
misrepresentations, any claim of DEALER's unfair or deceptive trade practices,
or any claim of improper environmental or workplace practices or conditions;

         c.       the PORSCHE PRODUCT was altered by, or for, DEALER;

                                      -24-
<PAGE>




         d.       DEALER refuses to cooperate fully in the defense of such claim
or litigation in such manner and to such extent as Porsche reasonably requires.

         DEALER agrees to pay all attorney fees and costs incurred by it prior
to Porsche's assumption of DEALER's defense, and thereafter to the extent DEALER
engages attorneys in addition to those engaged by Porsche.

         DEALER further agrees that Porsche or PORSCHE AG may offset any
recovery on DEALER's behalf against any indemnification that may be required
hereunder.

2.       INDEMNIFICATION BY DEALER

         Conditioned upon and subject to the provisions set forth in this
section, DEALER agrees to assume the defense and indemnify Porsche and PORSCHE
AG and hold them harmless against any claims asserted against either or both, in
any action concerning or alleging:

         a.       DEALER's failure to comply, in whole or in part, with any
obligation of DEALER under this Agreement;

         b.       DEALER's negligence in connection with the repair or servicing
of any PORSCHE PRODUCT or any product sold, serviced, and/or repaired by DEALER;

         c.       DEALER's modification to, or alteration of, a PORSCHE PRODUCT,
except those made pursuant to the express written instructions or approval of
Porsche;

         d.       DEALER's breach of a contract or agreement with DEALER's
customer or third-party;

                                      -25-
<PAGE>




         e.       DEALER's misleading statements, misrepresentations, or
deceptive or unfair practices;

         f.       DEALER's hiring, retention, or termination of any employee,
agent, officer, or owner.

         DEALER shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify, or hold Porsche
or PORSCHE AG harmless if:

         a.       Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG fail to provide DEALER with
notification within thirty (30) days of the assertion of such claim, or the
commencement of such litigation, against Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG, or within
thirty (30) days of discovery of facts giving rise to indemnification, whichever
is sooner, and to provide copies of any pleadings which have been served
together with all information then available regarding the circumstances giving
rise to the action or lawsuit;

         b.       Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG refuse to cooperate fully in the
defense of such claim or litigation, in such manner and to such extent, as
DEALER reasonably requires;

         c.       the claim or litigation involves allegations of liability
premised upon separate Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG conduct or omissions.

         Porsche agrees to pay all attorney fees and costs incurred prior to
DEALER's assumption of defense, and thereafter, to the extent Porsche and/or
PORSCHE AG engage attorneys in addition to those engaged by DEALER.

                                      -26-
<PAGE>




3.       CONDITIONS/EXCEPTIONS TO INDEMNIFICATION

         Whenever an action or complaint alleges liability on the part of
Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG and DEALER which would require each to defend and
indemnify the other pursuant to the terms of this Section, each party shall be
responsible for its own defense, including costs and attorneys' fees. The
responsibility of Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG and DEALER pursuant to this
subsection (3), shall in no way affect, or alter, the legal rights, if any, one
of the parties may have to indemnification or contribution from the other.

         Upon receipt of written notification of a claim or lawsuit and a
request for a defense and/or indemnification, a party shall have thirty (30)
days to conduct an investigation to determine whether or not, or under what
conditions, it will agree to defend and/or indemnify. During the thirty (30)-day
investigation period, the requesting party shall have a continuing duty to avoid
undue prejudice to the other party, to mitigate damage, and to protect its own
interests.

         The party accepting the request for defense and/or indemnification
shall have right to engage counsel of its choosing. A party may make its defense
and/or indemnification conditioned on the continued existence of the state of
facts as then known to such party, and may provide for the withdrawal of such
defense and/or indemnification at such time as facts arise which, if known at
the time of the original request, would have caused the party to refuse such a
request.

         If subsequent developments and/or amendments to the initial allegations
affect a party's rights under this Section, the party so affected may retender
or


                                      -27-
<PAGE>




withdraw from the agreement to defend and/or indemnify, as appropriate. A party
withdrawing from its agreement to defend and/or indemnify shall give timely
written notice which shall be effectual upon receipt. The withdrawing party
shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of defense, up to the date of
the other party's receipt of the notice of withdrawal.

         The defense, indemnification, and hold harmless obligations of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

            SECTION K: SALE OF PRINCIPAL ASSETS OR MAJORITY OWNERSHIP
                               INTEREST OF DEALER

1.       SALE OF PRINCIPAL ASSETS

         DEALER agrees to obtain Porsche's prior written approval of any
proposed disposition of DEALER's principal assets. DEALER shall give Porsche a
minimum of ninety (90) days' prior written notice of any proposed disposition or
sale. Porsche shall have the right, subject to applicable law, to withhold its
consent should Porsche determine that any such proposed disposition or sale of
DEALER's principal assets would preclude DEALER from successfully fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement.

2.       PORSCHE'S RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL OR OPTION TO PURCHASE

         Subject to applicable law, Porsche shall have the first right of
refusal or option to purchase the dealership assets, stock or ownership
interests if DEALER proposes to sell DEALER's principal assets, or the owners of
DEALER propose to sell a majority ownership interest in DEALER, or in the event
of the death or incapacity of the majority owner of DEALER. Porsche shall not
have such a right



                                      -28-
<PAGE>

of first refusal or option to purchase in the event of (i) a buy/sell where the
proposed buyer is an immediate family member of DEALER and who qualifies under
Porsche's standards for ownership of DEALER; (ii) a buy/sell to an individual
for whom there is a current Successor Addendum in effect pursuant to Section M
below; (iii) the death or incapacity of the majority owner where the successor
or heir qualifies under Porsche's standards for ownership; or (iv) the death or
incapacity of the majority owner whether there is a current Successor Addendum
in effect for the heir. Porsche's right of first refusal or option to purchase
shall include the right of first refusal or option to acquire any leasehold
interest or real property used in DEALER's business where such interest or
property is being transferred by DEALER, Owner or any entity controlled by
DEALER or Owner (an "Affiliate") in connection with the sale of the dealership
assets or stock.

         Porsche's exercise of its right or option under this Section supersedes
any right or attempt by DEALER to transfer its interest in, or ownership of, the
dealership. Porsche's right or option may be assigned by it to any third party
and Porsche hereby guarantees the full payment to DEALER of the purchase price
by such assignee. Porsche's guarantee shall not extend to the assignee's
obligations under any lease, consulting or other agreement which, by its terms,
extends beyond the closing of the purchase and sale of the dealership assets or
stock. Porsche may disclose the terms of any pending buy/sell agreement and any
other relevant dealership performance information to any potential assignee.
Porsche's



                                      -29-
<PAGE>




rights under this Section will be binding on and enforceable against any
successor in interest of DEALER or purchaser of DEALER's assets or stock.

         Porsche shall have forty-five (45) days, unless a lesser time is
required by applicable state law, from the following events within which to
exercise its right of first refusal or option: (1) Porsche's receipt of all data
and documentation customarily required by it to evaluate a proposed transfer of
ownership, including all documents relating to the proposed transaction; or (2)
Porsche's receipt of written notice from DEALER of the death of the majority
owner of DEALER; or (3) Porsche's disapproval of any application submitted by an
Owner's heir pursuant to Section M(2) below.

         If DEALER has entered into a bona fide written buy/sell agreement for
its dealership business or assets, Porsche's right under this Section is a right
of first refusal, enabling Porsche to assume the buyer's rights and obligations
under such buy/sell agreement, and to cancel this Agreement and all rights
granted DEALER. Upon Porsche's request, DEALER agrees to provide other documents
relating to the proposed disposition or sale and any other information which
Porsche deems appropriate including, but not limited to, those documents
reflecting other agreements or understandings between the parties to the
buy/sell agreement. Refusal to provide such documentation, or to state that no
such documents exist, shall create the presumption that the buy/sell agreement
is not a bona fide agreement.

         If any of the proposed consideration for the proposed sale or transfer
consists of anything other than cash, a cash equivalent or a promissory note,


                                      -30-
<PAGE>




Porsche, as the holder of the right of first refusal, shall have the right to
pay, in lieu of such form of consideration, cash in an amount equal to the fair
market value of such consideration. The promissory note of Porsche or any third
party if guaranteed by Porsche shall be deemed the equivalent of any third party
promissory note included in the proposed consideration.

         Porsche's exercise of its right of first refusal under this Section
shall neither be dependent upon nor require its prior consideration of or
refusal to approve the proposed buyer or transferee. However, where Porsche
exercises its right of first refusal pursuant to this Section, it shall be
obligated to reimburse the reasonable fees and expenses to the proposed buyer or
transferee with whom the DEALER had entered into a bona fide buy/sell.

         In the event of the death or incapacity of a majority owner (subject to
the limitations set forth in Section K(2) above and in Section M below), or if
DEALER submits a proposal which Porsche determines is not bona fide or in good
faith, Porsche has the option to purchase the principal assets of DEALER
utilizing the dealership business, including real estate and leasehold interest,
and to cancel this Agreement and the rights granted DEALER. The purchase price
of the dealership assets will be determined by good faith negotiations between
the parties. If an agreement cannot be reached, the purchase price will be
exclusively determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The site of the
arbitration shall be the office of the American Arbitration Association in the
locality nearest DEALER's Approved Location.


                                      -31-

<PAGE>




         Upon Porsche's exercise of its right or option and tender of
performance under the buy/sell agreement, or upon whatever terms may be
expressed in the buy/sell agreement, DEALER shall forthwith transfer the
affected real property by warranty deed conveying marketable title, free and
clear of all liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, tenancies and occupancies.
The warranty deed shall be in proper form for recording, and DEALER shall
deliver complete possession of the property and deed at the time of closing.
DEALER shall also furnish to Porsche all copies of any easements, licenses or
other documents affecting the property or dealership operations and shall assign
any permits or licenses that are necessary or desirable for the use of, or
appurtenant to, the property or the conduct of such dealer operations. DEALER
also agrees to execute and deliver to Porsche instruments satisfactory to
Porsche conveying title to all personal property, including leasehold interests,
involved in the transfer or sale to Porsche. If any personal property is subject
to any lien or change of any kind, DEALER agrees to procure the discharge and
satisfaction thereof prior to the closing of sale of such property to Porsche.

                             SECTION L: TERMINATION

1.       VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY DEALER

         DEALER may voluntarily terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
written notice to Porsche. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Porsche and
DEALER, the voluntary termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after
Porsche's receipt thereof.

                                      -32-

2.       TERMINATION DUE TO CERTAIN ACTS OR EVENTS

Agreement as to warrant its termination. Accordingly, DEALER agrees that if it
engages in any of the following types of conduct, Porsche shall have the right

removed within thirty (30) days, or any levy under attachment, execution or
similar process, or the execution of an assignment for the benefit of creditors,

materially compromise DEALER's reputation with the public;

of this Agreement, or any of the rights granted it under this Agreement, or any
attempted or actual transfer or assignment or delegation by DEALER, of any of
the responsibility assumed by it under this Agreement without the prior written
approval of Porsche;

         i.       the conduct, directly or indirectly, of any dealership

location other than those specifically approved herein for such operation
without the prior written approval of Porsche;

of this Agreement;

         r.       breach or violation by DEALER of any other term or provision
of this Agreement.

         Upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing acts or events Porsche may
terminate this Agreement by giving DEALER notice thereof, such termination to be
effective upon the date specified in such notice, or such later date as may be
required by any applicable statute.

3.       TERMINATION FOR FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE

         If Porsche determines that DEALER has failed to perform its sales,
service, parts or customer satisfaction responsibilities under this Agreement or
to provide adequate Dealership Facilities, Porsche shall notify DEALER in
writing of such failure(s), and shall provide DEALER with specific goals or
performance standards with which DEALER must comply. If DEALER fails to comply
with the goals or performance standards over a period of not less than one
hundred eighty (180) days, or such other period as may be required by applicable
statute, or otherwise refuses to correct such failure(s), Porsche may terminate
this Agreement by giving DEALER notice thereof, such termination to be effective
upon the date specified in such notice, or such later date as may be required by
any applicable statute.

4.       TERMINATION BECAUSE OF DEATH OR INCAPACITY OF MAJORITY OWNER

         Subject to applicable law and other provisions of this Agreement,
Porsche may terminate this Agreement upon the death or incapacity of DEALER



                                      -36-
<PAGE>

hereunder if an individual, or DEALER's majority owner if a partnership, limited
liability company, or corporation, upon written notice to DEALER and such
owner's legal representative.

         Porsche shall provide such notice of termination within a reasonable
time after notice to Porsche of the DEALER/majority owner's death or incapacity,
such termination to be effective upon the date specified, or such later date as
may be required by applicable statute.

5.       NOTICE OF TERMINATION

         Any notice of termination under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be mailed to DEALER at its Approved Location by certified mail, return
receipt requested, overnight delivery service, or shall be delivered in person
to the dealership. Such notice shall be effective upon the date of receipt.

         Porsche shall state all known grounds on which it relies in its
termination of DEALER, but shall have the right to amend such notice as
appropriate. Porsche's failure to refer to any additional grounds for
termination shall not constitute a waiver of its right later to rely upon such
grounds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Porsche specifically reserves the right
to amend any notice of termination to assert additional grounds which are later
made known to Porsche through further investigation or otherwise.

6.       CONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS RELATIONS

         Upon receipt of any notice of termination or non-renewal, DEALER agrees
to conduct itself and its operation until the effective date of termination or
non-renewal



                                      -37-
<PAGE>

in a manner that will not injure the reputation or goodwill of the PORSCHE MARKS
or Porsche.

         If, after the effective date of termination or non-renewal, Porsche
agrees to accept orders from DEALER to fill customers' orders received prior to
such date by DEALER, or if Porsche otherwise transacts business with DEALER
relating to the sale, service, or repair of PORSCHE PRODUCTS, all such
transactions shall be governed by the terms of the Agreement so far as those
terms are applicable. No such acceptance of orders or other acts by Porsche
shall waive termination or constitute a renewal of this Agreement.

7.       REPURCHASE PROVISIONS

         A.       PORSCHE'S OBLIGATIONS

         Upon the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement, Porsche shall
have the right to cancel any and all shipments of PORSCHE PRODUCTS scheduled for
delivery to DEALER, and Porsche shall repurchase from DEALER the following:

         1.       New, unused, never titled, undamaged, unmodified, current
                  model year Porsche vehicles with fewer than 100 miles, then
                  unsold in DEALER's inventory. The price for such vehicles
                  shall be the invoice price previously paid by DEALER therefor,
                  less all refunds or other allowances paid or credited to
                  DEALER by Porsche;

         2.       New, unused and undamaged Genuine Porsche Parts and
                  Accessories contained in original packaging, and in unbroken
                  lots which are listed in Porsche's current parts catalog then
                  unsold in



                                      -38-
<PAGE>




                  DEALER's inventory and which are in good and saleable
                  condition. The prices for such Genuine Porsche Parts and
                  Accessories shall be the current prices listed in Porsche's
                  current parts catalog;

         3.       all required Porsche tools and equipment designed specifically
                  for service on PORSCHE PRODUCTS owned by DEALER and purchased
                  from Porsche or a recommended vendor, provided any sets of
                  such tools are complete and no parts or components are missing
                  or otherwise unusable. The price at which Porsche will
                  purchase such tools and equipment shall be determined by
                  Porsche, but in no event will such prices be less than
                  DEALER's purchase price for such tools and equipment reduced
                  by straight-line depreciation on the basis of a three (3)-year
                  useful life;

         4.       undamaged signs in good and usable condition which Porsche
                  recommended or required DEALER to purchase and which are owned
                  by DEALER. The price for such signs shall be the price(s) paid
                  by DEALER reduced by straight-line depreciation on the basis
                  of a three (3)-year useful life;

         B.       DEALER'S OBLIGATIONS

         Porsche's obligations, as set forth in this Section, are contingent
upon DEALER fulfilling the following obligations:

         1.       within fifteen (15) days of the effective date of termination
                  or non-renewal, DEALER shall furnish to Porsche a list of
                  vehicle identification numbers and such other information and
                  documents

                                      -39-
<PAGE>




                  as Porsche may require pertaining to the Porsche vehicles
                  subject to the repurchase provisions herein. DEALER shall
                  deliver all such Porsche vehicles in accordance with Porsche's
                  instructions;

         2.       within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination
                  or non-renewal, DEALER shall deliver or mail to Porsche a
                  detailed inventory of the Genuine Porsche Parts and
                  Accessories, special tools and equipment which DEALER has
                  determined to be eligible for repurchase. Within thirty (30)
                  days of its receipt of such inventory, Porsche will provide
                  DEALER with a list of the items it has determined are eligible
                  to be repurchased and instructions as to the procedures to
                  follow in returning such items to Porsche. DEALER shall, at
                  its expense, deliver all such items to such location as
                  designated by Porsche;

         3.       DEALER shall execute and deliver to Porsche instruments
                  satisfactory to Porsche conveying good and marketable title to
                  all repurchased items. DEALER agrees to comply with the
                  requirements of any applicable law relating to bulk sales and
                  transfers and to satisfy and discharge any liens or
                  encumbrances on all such items prior to delivery to Porsche;

         4.       DEALER will remove, at its own expense, all signage bearing
                  Porsche Marks which it owns from DEALER's Approved Location(s)
                  before it is eligible for payment for any repurchased items
                  pursuant to this Section.

         5.       Porsche will pay DEALER for qualifying repurchased items as
                  soon as practicable, upon DEALER's compliance with its
                  obligations set forth herein and upon Porsche's computation of
                  any outstanding indebtedness of DEALER to Porsche. Porsche
                  shall be entitled to offset against any such amounts due to
                  DEALER hereunder any and all indebtedness or other obligations
                  of DEALER to Porsche.

         6.       If DEALER disagrees with Porsche's valuation of any item
                  herein, and DEALER and Porsche have not resolved their
                  disagreement within sixty (60) days of the effective date of
                  termination or expiration of this Agreement, Porsche shall pay
                  to DEALER the amount to which it reasonably believes DEALER is
                  entitled. DEALER's exclusive remedy to recover any additional
                  sums that it believes is due under this Section shall be by
                  resort to any existing Alternative Dispute Resolution program
                  established by Porsche that is binding on Porsche. If no
                  Alternative Dispute Resolution program is then existing,
                  DEALER's exclusive remedy shall be by resort to arbitration in
                  accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
                  American Arbitration Association (AAA). The site of the
                  arbitration shall be the office of the AAA in the locality
                  nearest DEALER's Approved Location.

                    SECTION M: SUCCESSOR RIGHTS UPON DEATH OR
                               INCAPACITY OF OWNER

1.       SUCCESSOR ADDENDUM

         Porsche will not terminate the Agreement upon the death or incapacity
of DEALER if an individual, or the majority owner of DEALER if a partnership, or
limited liability company, or corporation (hereinafter "OWNER"), provided that
prior to OWNER's death or incapacity:

         a.       OWNER executes and delivers to Porsche a written nomination of
a candidate to succeed to the ownership interest of OWNER;

         b.       the proposed candidate submits a dealer application and
provides all evaluative information and documentation requested by Porsche;

         c.       each of DEALER's other owners, if any, executes and delivers
to Porsche a consent to the nomination;

         d.       the proposed candidate is approved by Porsche and a Successor
Addendum is executed and operative at the time of OWNER's death or incapacity.

         OWNER may, at any time, withdraw a nomination of a proposed candidate
or cancel an executed Successor Addendum by giving written notice to Porsche.
Porsche may cancel an executed Successor Addendum upon written notice to OWNER
should Porsche determine that the successor no longer complies with Porsche's
then current criteria used in qualifying dealer owners and General Managers, if
appropriate.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>




2.       SUCCESSOR BY WILL OR OPERATION OF LAW

         If the deceased OWNER has not nominated a successor in accordance with
this Section, and all of the beneficial interest of the deceased OWNER has
passed by Will or by the laws of the intestate succession directly to the
deceased OWNER's spouse and/or children (hereinafter "Heirs"), Porsche will not
terminate the Agreement provided:

         a.       OWNER's legal representative provides written notification to
Porsche within sixty (60) days of the death of OWNER of such Heir or Heirs'
intent to succeed OWNER and a designation of a proposed General Manager;

         b.       the Heir, Heirs, and General Manager designated if not an
Heir, submit appropriate applications to Porsche and provide all personal and
financial information required by Porsche in connection with its review of the
application(s);

         c. the Heir, Heirs, and General Manager designated if not an Heir, have
the qualifications, automotive business experience, and ability considered by
Porsche to be necessary to successfully operate the dealership and perform
DEALER's obligations under this Agreement.

         If Porsche does not approve the Heir, Heir(s), or the designated
candidate for General Manager, or if the OWNER's legal representative withdraws
the notice of the Heir(s') intent to succeed as OWNER, or if the Heir(s) or
designated candidate for General Manager fail to timely provide the information
and documentation required by Porsche, Porsche will issue a notice of
termination pursuant to Section L(4).

         Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice required
to be given by either party to the other, pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, shall be in writing and delivered personally or by mail to Porsche at
its national headquarters, and to DEALER at the address stated in this
Agreement, or at such other address as the party to be addressed may have
previously designated by written notice to the other party. Unless otherwise
specified in the Agreement, such notices shall be effective upon receipt.

2.       NO IMPLIED WAIVERS

         The failure of either party, at any time, to require performance by the
other party of any provision herein shall, in no way, affect the right of such
party to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall any waiver
by any party of a breach of any provision herein constitute a waiver of any
succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor constitute a waiver of
the provision itself.

         Any continuation of business relations between the parties following
expiration of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of the expiration, nor
shall it imply that either party has committed to continue to do business with
the other at any time in the future. Should this Agreement be renewed, or should
any other form of agreement be offered to DEALER, Porsche reserves the right to
offer an agreement of a length and upon such additional terms and conditions as
it deems reasonable.

3.       ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         There are no prior agreements or understandings, either oral or
written, between the parties affecting this Agreement or relating to the sale or
service of Porsche Products, except as otherwise specifically provided for or
referred to in this Agreement. DEALER acknowledges that no representations or
statements other than those expressly set forth therein were made by Porsche or
any officer, employee, agent or representative thereof, or were relied upon by
DEALER in entering into this Agreement. This Agreement cancels and supersedes
all previous agreements between the parties relating to the subject matters
covered herein. No change or addition to, or deletion of, any portion of this
Agreement shall be valid or binding upon the parties hereto unless the same is
approved in writing by an officer of each of the parties hereto.

         This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and may be amended only by
a written instrument executed by each of the parties, or their respective
personal representatives, successors and/or assigns. This Agreement supersedes
any and all prior agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
there are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

         Should Porsche determine that any federal or state law or regulation
requires a change or changes in any of the provisions of this Agreement, Porsche
may offer to DEALER an amendment or an amended Agreement



                                      -45-
<PAGE>




embodying such change or changes. If DEALER shall fail to execute such amendment
or amended Agreement and return it to Porsche within thirty (30) days after it
is offered, Porsche, may terminate this Agreement subject to applicable law, by
giving written notice to DEALER.

4.       NO AGENCY

         DEALER is an independent business and will conduct its operations on
its own behalf and for its own account. DEALER has no power or authority to act
for, or to bind Porsche and/or PORSCHE AG. Except as expressly provided in the
Agreement, Porsche will not be liable for any expenditure made or incurred by
DEALER in connection with DEALER's performance of its obligations pursuant to
the Agreement. DEALER is not an agent of Porsche, and Porsche owes no fiduciary
duty to DEALER.

         DEALER agrees that it has no rights, without limitation, arising from
or in connection with any agreement between Porsche and any other Porsche
dealer, and that DEALER is not a third party beneficiary of any such agreement.
Nothing herein grants DEALER any rights to enforce any such agreement. DEALER
also agrees that no third party shall have any enforceable rights under this
Agreement.

5.       ASSIGNMENT

         This is a personal service agreement and may not be assigned or sold,
in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law,
without the prior written approval of Porsche. Any attempted transfer,
assignment or sale without Porsche's prior written approval will be void and not
binding upon
                                      -46-

Porsche. Porsche reserves the right to assign this Agreement without DEALER's
consent to any person, firm or corporation succeeding to its business and to any
subsidiary or affiliated company of Porsche.

6.       SEVERABILITY

         If any term or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance, shall, to any extent, be found to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions and any application thereof
shall, nevertheless, continue in full force and effect without being impaired or
invalidated in any way.

7.       NO FRANCHISE FEE

         DEALER warrants that it has paid no fee, nor has it provided any goods
or services in lieu of a fee, to Porsche or any other party in consideration of
entering into this Agreement.

8.       HEADINGS

         The headings of the Sections of this Agreement are for convenience and
reference only and shall, in no way, be construed to explain, modify, amplify,

Agreement or to be a part of this Agreement.

9.       NEW AND SUPERSEDING DEALER AGREEMENTS

         In the event any new and superseding form of dealer agreement is
offered by Porsche to authorized Porsche dealers generally, at any time prior to
the expiration of the term of this Agreement, Porsche may, by written notice to
DEALER, replace this Agreement with a new agreement in a new and


                                      -47-
<PAGE>




superseding form for a term not less than the then unexpired term of this
Agreement.

policies, procedures, and standards prepared by Porsche, based upon its
evaluation of the marketplace. All such policies, procedures and standards shall
be reasonable. DEALER agrees to abide by all such policies, procedures, and
standards. Porsche may reasonably amend its policies, procedures and standards
from time to time.

contained in it is intended or shall be construed to be for the benefit of any
