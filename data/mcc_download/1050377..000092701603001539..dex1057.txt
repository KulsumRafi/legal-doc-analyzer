said Lessor, and the Lessee further agrees that, in case of the failure of the
said Lessee to pay the rent herein reserved when the same shall become due, and
it becomes necessary for the Lessor to collect said rent by suit or through an
attorney, the Lessee will pay the Lessor a reasonable attorney's fee, together
with all costs and charges thereof. This provision of this Lease shall be deemed
as creating a security interest in the personal property and fixtures of the
Lessee located on the Premises and shall be further deemed as creating a
security agreement between the Lessor and Lessee pursuant to the Uniform
Commercial Code. The Lessee shall execute, file and refile any and all financing
statements and other security agreements as Lessor shall from time to time
require and hereby authorize the Lessor in its name to file such financing
statement(s) as Lessor deems necessary, from time to time, to perfect all
interest or right granted hereunder which authority shall not be revoked during
the term of this Lease. Any such revocation shall constitute an element of
default for which the Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Lease or as
otherwise provided for herein.

     18. LOSS AND DAMAGE. In the event that the Premises, or any part thereof,
shall at any time be destroyed or so damaged by fire or other elements as to be
unfit for occupancy of use by the Lessee, then and in that event, the Lessor
shall have the option (1) to terminate this Lease, or (2) to repair and rebuild

bursting or leaking of any pipes or waste about said Premises, or from any act
of negligence of any co-tenant or occupants of the offices, or any other person,
or fire, or hurricane, or other act of God, or from any cause whatsoever.

     20. SIGNS. Lessee shall be allowed a sign at the entrance of the Premises
with such lettering to be of a kind, type, character, description and adhesion
to be approved by the Lessor in the interests of having a uniform system of

Tenant's expense. At lease expiration the sign must be removed. The site in
which the sign was must be in the same condition as it was received.

     21. HOLDING OVER. If the Lessee shall hold over, with or without the

investigation thereof.

        (d) Waiver of Subrogation. Lessor and Lessee waive, unless said waiver
should invalidate any such insurance, their right to recover damages against
each other for any reason whatsoever to the extent the damaged party recovers
indemnity from its insurance carrier. Any insurance policy procured by either
Lessee or Lessor which does not name the other as a named insured shall, if
obtainable, contain an express waiver of any right of subrogation by the
insurance company, including but not limited to, Lessee's workmen's compensation
carrier, against Lessor or Lessee, whichever the case may be. All public
liability and property damage policies shall contain an endorsement that Lessor,
although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover for
damage caused by the negligence of Lessee.

     23. SUBORDINATION. The Lessee agrees that this Lease shall be subject and
subordinate to any mortgage or deed of trust now encumbering the Premises or the
offices, or which may hereinafter be made on account of any proposed loan to be
made against said Premises by the Lessor to the full extent of all debts and
charges secured thereby; and to any renewals and extension of all or any part
thereof, which said Lessor may hereafter at any time elect to place on said
Premises or the offices, and said Lessee agrees upon request to hereafter
execute any document(s) which the counsel for the Lessor may deem necessary to
accomplish that end, and in default of the Lessee's so doing, that the Lessor is
hereby empowered to execute such document(s) in the name of the Lessee and as
the act and deed of said Lessee and this authority is declared to be coupled
with an interest and not revocable. No estate for years is created by this
Lease.

     24. EXPIRATION. At the expiration of the term, the Lessee shall quietly and
peaceably deliver the Premises to the Lessor in the same repair and condition in
which they were received, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

     25. PERFORMANCE/RE-ENTRY. The Lessor hereby covenants with the Lessee that,
upon the performance of the Lessee of all conditions hereinabove set forth on
the part of the Lessee to be kept and performed, Lessee may quietly have, hold,
occupy and use the above described Premises without interruption by the Lessor;
provided that, upon the breach of any of the covenants, conditions, and
stipulations herein contained to be kept and performed by the Lessee, the Lessor
may immediately without notice and without the necessity of legal process
reenter said Premises, and thereupon, at the Lessor's option, said Lease shall
forthwith be terminated and/or the Lessor may exercise any of the options
hereinabove provided for the Lessor's benefit in case of default on the part of

                                       7

<PAGE>


     26. EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE. The Lessor covenants that lessor will keep the
exterior of the offices in good repair. The Lessee shall give to the Lessor
thirty (30) days written notice of any repairs to the offices, claimed by
Lessee, and the Lessor shall have a reasonable time thereafter to make them.

     27. CONTEXT. The term Lessor and Lessee as herein contained shall include
singular and/or plural, masculine, feminine, and/or neuter, heirs, successors,
personal representatives and/or assigns wherever the context so requires or
admits.

     28. WAIVER. The failure of the Lessor in one or more instances to insist
upon strict performance or observance of one or more of the covenants or
conditions or to exercise any remedy, privilege or option herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Lessor, shall not operate or be construed as a relinquishment
or waiver of the further exercise of such covenant or condition or of the right
to enforce the same or to exercise such privileges, option, or remedy, but the
same shall continue in full force and effect. The receipt by the Lessor of Basic
Rent, or additional rent or any other payment required to be made by the Lessee,
or any part thereof, shall not be a waiver of any other additional rent or
payment then due, nor shall such receipt, though with knowledge of the breach of
any covenant or condition hereof, operate as or be deemed to have been made
unless made by the Lessor in writing.

     29. RULES AND REGULATIONS. Reasonable rules and regulations regarding the
Premises, including the walkways and parking areas, and the use thereof, which
may hereafter be promulgated by the Lessor, shall be observed by the Lessee and
the Lessee's employees, agents and business invitees. The Lessor reserves the
right to rescind any rules promulgated hereafter, and to make such other and
further rules and regulations as in its reasonable judgement may from time to
time be described for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Premises and for
the preservation of good order therein, which rules when so made and reasonable
notice given to the Lessee, shall have the same force and effect as if
originally made a part of this Lease. Such other and further reasonable rules
shall not, however, be consistent with proper and rightful enjoyment by the
Lessee of the Premises in the conduct of its business. All said rules and
regulations shall be uniformly applied to all Lessees at the offices of the
Lessor.

     30. CONDEMNATION. If the offices or any substantial part thereof, including
but not limited to, the Premises or any part thereof, shall be taken by a public
or quasi-public authority under any power or eminent domain, condemnation or the
like, this Lease shall terminate upon the taking of possession by the condemning
authority and the Lessee shall have no claim or interest in or to any award or
damages for such taking. If the proceedings for such

                                       8



<PAGE>

taking are instituted or threatened to be instituted by such authority, a
deed given by Lessor in lieu of condemnation shall have the same effect as if a
final judgement of taking had been entered in any such proceedings. The Lessee
shall have no claim, or right to claim, or be entitled to any portion of any
awards or monies paid to Lessor as a result of such condemnation proceedings,
and all rights of the Lessee thereto, if any shall be deemed a waiver of any
independent right the Lessee may possess to institute an action for relocation
of its business and trade fixtures in connection with any such taking.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee hereby irrevocably assigns to the
Lessor any award which may be made for its unexpired leasehold interest.

     31. NOTICES. All notices and demands, legal or otherwise, incidental to
this Lease, or the occupancy of the Premises, shall be in writing. If the
Lessor, its agents or nominees, desires to give or serve upon the Lessee any
notice or demands, it shall be sufficient to send a copy thereof by certified
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Lessee at:

     ______________________________
     ______________________________
     ______________________________



     The date of the mailing of any notices sent by the Lessor or the Lessee
shall be the date such notice is postmarked and deposited in a United States
Post Office Box with postage thereon prepaid.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the respective parties hereto have caused these
presents to be signed, sealed and delivered on the day and year written:
