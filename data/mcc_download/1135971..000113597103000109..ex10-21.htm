<FONT SIZE=3><P>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potomac Electric Power Company ("Pepco") established the Potomac Electric Power Company Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Pepco plan"), effective November 18, 1982, to enable certain executives to supplement their retirement income by deferring the receipt of compensation for services performed while the Pepco plan was in effect.  The Pepco plan was amended from time to time thereafter.  On March 28, 2002, further amendments were authorized to the Pepco plan to recognize the intent to consummate a transaction (the "Merger") by which Pepco and Conectiv would become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Pepco Holdings") and, for the near term future, to maintain for the benefit of the executives of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries, the level of benefits provided to such executives by their respective employers prior to the merger.  Such amendments include authorization to name Pepco Holdings as the sponsor of the plan; to change the name of the Pepco plan to reflect the change in plan sponsorship; to amend the definition of "executive" as eligible to participate in the plan; to add an in-service withdrawal feature to the Pepco plan; and to provide an investment option which credits a participant's account with increases or decreases in value attributable to phantom units of Pepco Holdings common stock, together with any dividends or stock reinvestment rights associated with the designated phantom units.  Therefore, the Pepco plan has been amended and is restated herein and is now known as the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Executive and Director Deferred Compensation Plan. (the "Plan").<BR>

</FONT></TD>

<TD WIDTH="93%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Plan Year, the Executive may elect any or all of the following four options for deferring compensation, to the extent applicable:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Option 1</B>  -  the Executive may elect to defer an amount of Normal Compensation. The Agreement may specify that the Executive's salary will be reduced by the amount of the Deferred Compensation on a ratable basis throughout the Plan Year or that the Executive's salary will be reduced by a specified amount or amounts in a specified month or months of the Plan Year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Option 2</B>  -  the Executive may elect to defer the difference between (i) six percent (6%) of his compensation. as defined in the principal defined contribution savings plan of Pepco Holdings or one of its subsidiaries in which the Executive participates (the "Applicable Savings Plan"), and (ii) the amount of pre-tax contributions he is permitted to make under the Applicable Savings Plan. Under this Option 2, the Executive's salary will be reduced by the amount of Deferred Compensation at the same time and in the same amounts as if' such reduction was governed by the election then in effect for the Executive under the Applicable Savings Plan.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Option 3</B>  -  the Executive may elect to defer such other compensation which would otherwise be paid to the Executive during the Plan Year provided such compensation has been approved by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion as eligible to be deferred under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Option 4 </B> -  subject to the prior approval of the Board of Directors, which approval may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Board of the Directors, the Executive may elect to have the Executive's Account under this Plan credited with a deferred compensation entitlement attributable to any other nonqualified deferred compensation program maintained by the Company, provided that such transfer will be accompanied by a corresponding elimination of the Company's obligation under such other deferred compensation arrangement and provided further that no such transfer will be permitted with respect to any deferred compensation entitlement which would otherwise become payable to the Executive under the terms of such other nonqualified deferred compensation program within the same calendar year as the year of the proposed transfer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Executive who elects Deferred Compensation with respect to a Plan Year shall specify <BR>
in his Agreement for such Plan Year the Option or Options which shall apply for such Plan Year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will credit the Deferred Compensation to the Account of each participating Executive as of the day such amount would have been paid to the Executive if the Executive's Agreement had not been in effect. The Executive may elect to have the Company credit, on a monthly basis, all Deferred Compensation into the Executive's Account with an amount in the nature of interest at either (i) the prime interest rate quoted by the Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., (the "Prime Rate"), as of the last day of the month, (ii) a rate equal to the rate of return with respect to any one or a combination of the investment funds selected by the Human Resources Committee (an "Investment Fund Rate"), or (iii) a combination of the Prime Rate and an Investment Fund Rate. The Prime Rate or the appropriate Investment Fund Rate(s) shall be credited to the Executive's Account as of the last day of each calendar month based on the daily balances in the Account which are to be adjusted with respect to the Prime Rate or each designated Investment Fund Rate, as the case may be.  The crediting of such interest on a monthly basis shall continue until such balance in the Executive's Account has been reduced to zero by reason of benefit payments under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive may also elect to have the investment return applicable to all or part of any Deferred Compensation credited to the Executive's Account determined by reference to phantom shares of Pepco Holdings Common Stock.  In Order to initially determine the number of phantom shares of Pepco Holdings Common Stock which will serve as the basis for adjusting the value of an Executive's Account, the full amount of Deferred Compensation to be credited with an investment return based upon phantom shares shall be divided by the average of the high and low sale prices of the Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. on the second business day prior to the date upon which the Executive's Account is to be credited with such Deferred Compensation.  The resulting number will represent the number of phantom shares to be credited to such Executive's Account.  For purposes of determining the value of the Executive's Account which is attributable to phantom shares, each phantom share shall be deemed to have a value of one share of Common Stock of the Company and any time a dividend payment is made with respect to a share of common stock of the Company, an equivalent amount shall be added to the account of the Director with respect to each phantom share then credited to the Account.  All such dividend equivalent amounts added to the Director's Account shall be expressed in the form of phantom shares or fractions thereof.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive elects Option 2, the Company shall credit the Executive's Account with a Matching Company Credit equal in value to the percentage of Deferred Compensation elected by the Executive under Option 2 which would have been matched by the Company if the Executive had contributed such Deferred Compensation to the applicable savings plan.  The Matching Company Credit shall be made to the Executive's Account at the same time as the corresponding Deferred Compensation is credited to the Executive's Account pursuant to Option 2.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall furnish each participating Executive with an annual report showing the balance in the Executive's Account as of June 30 of each year.<BR>

In the event an Executive's early distribution is submitted within sixty (60) days after a Change in Control (as may be defined in an agreement between the Executive and the Company or in a plan in which the Executive participates) or an elimination of an investment alternative under the Plan that the Human Resources Committee determines is a substantial detriment to Executives, the forfeiture penalty shall be reduced to five percent (5%).<BR>

In the event that a participating Executive or a participating Director dies after the benefit commencement date, any remaining benefit payments shall be paid to the Executive's or the Director's Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. In the event that no Beneficiary survives the Executive or the Director, an amount equal to the remaining balance in the Executive's or Director's Account (or two times the Account balance if death occurs prior to the benefit commencement date) shall be paid to the estate of the Executive or the Director, as the case may be, in a lump sum within thirty (30) days following the date on which the Company is notified of the Beneficiary's death.<BR>
