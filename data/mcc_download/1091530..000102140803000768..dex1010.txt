     1.2.      OTHER DEFINITIONAL PROVISIONS

               Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined in
Section 1.1 hereof shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Note Purchase
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Defined terms in the singular

2.   LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT

     2.1.      LOAN COMMITMENT.

               (a)  Advances. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Lender
agrees to make advances (each, an "Advance", collectively, the "Advances") to
the Borrowers during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed the Loan Commitment.

               (b)  Purpose. The Borrowers shall use the Advances solely to pay
the Contractual Obligations owed to Lender or OnStar.

     2.2.      MANNER OF BORROWING

               (a)  Request for Advance. Either Borrower may request an Advance
by delivering Lender a completed Request for Advance in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B (a "Request for Advance") not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City
time on the date such Advance is to be funded. Such Request for Advance shall be
signed by an authorized officer of such Borrower and shall indicate the amount
of the requested Advance, a description of the Contractual Obligations for which
such Advance is being requested, and the date for such Advance, which shall be
the date on which the Contractual Obligations being funded by such Advance
become due

                                       6

<PAGE>

and owing (the "Funding Date"). Each Request for Advance shall be irrevocable
and effective only upon receipt by the Lender.

               (b)  Funding. The Lender shall make each Advance on the date
requested by making a notation on its books of account (or, if applicable, the
books of account of OnStar) that the Contractual Obligations due and owing by
the applicable Borrower on the date of the Advance have been paid in an amount
equal to the amount of the Advance.

     2.3.      INTEREST

               (a)  Interest Accrual. Interest shall accrue at the Interest Rate
on a daily basis during each Quarterly Period on the unpaid principal amount of
all Advances and shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for
the most recent two Quarterly Periods then ended.

               (b)  Default Interest. In the event the Borrowers shall fail to
make any payment of the principal or interest when due, after giving effect to
any applicable grace period provided for in this Agreement, the Borrowers shall
pay interest on such unpaid amount, payable from time to time on demand, from
the date such amount shall have become due to the date of payment thereof (after
as well as before judgment), accruing on a daily basis, at a per annum rate
equal to the sum of the Interest Rate in effect at such time plus one percent
(1.0%).

     2.4.      PAYMENTS AND NOTES

               (a)  Form of Payment. Each payment of principal or interest will
be made to the Lender by certified or bank cashier's check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds, at such address or to such account as the Lender
specifies in writing to the Borrowers at least five (5) Business Days before
such payment is to be made, except that the Borrowers may, at their option and
subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 2.4, make any
interest payment with shares of Class A Common Stock having an aggregate Fair
Market Value as calculated on the applicable Interest Payment Date equal to the
amount of the interest due. If the Borrowers elect to pay interest in Class A
Common Stock, the number of shares to be issued to the Lender shall be
calculated by dividing the amount of interest due by the Fair Market Value of a
share of Class A Common Stock on the applicable Interest Payment Date; provided,
however, that with respect to any resulting fraction of a share of Class A
Common Stock, the Borrowers may, at their option, either (a) round up such
fraction to the nearest whole share, or (b) pay an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a
share of Class A Common Stock on such Interest Payment Date, computed to the
nearest whole cent, in lieu of issuing a fractional share. Section 9.3 of the
Note Purchase Agreement shall govern the procedures for the issuance of
certificates upon any such payment of interest in Class A Common Stock. The
ability of the Borrowers to pay interest in Class A Common Stock shall be
expressly conditioned on such issuance not requiring a stockholder approval
(which has not been obtained) under, or otherwise being in violation of, any
applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market
or any domestic securities exchange or other public trading market upon which
the Class A Common Stock may be listed or quoted.

               (b)  Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time
insufficient funds are received by and available to the Lender to pay fully all
amounts of principal and interest, due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, to pay interest due hereunder, and (ii) second, to pay principal then
due hereunder.

               (c)  Promissory Note. The Lender may request that the Advances be
evidenced by a promissory note (the "Revenue Share Note"). In such event, the
Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Lender a promissory note
payable to the Lender and in a form approved by the Lender. In the event that a
Revenue Share Note is issued, the Borrowers will pay all sums becoming due
hereunder for interest or principal, without the presentation or surrender of
the Revenue Share Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that if the
Revenue Share Note is paid in full, following such payment, the Revenue Share
Note shall be surrendered to the Borrowers for cancellation.

<PAGE>

     2.5.      PAYMENT AT MATURITY

               The outstanding principal amount of all Advances, together with
any accrued interest thereon, shall be due and payable in full in immediately
available U.S. Dollars on the earlier of: (i) the Maturity Date, or (ii) such
earlier date as the Advances become due and payable pursuant to this Agreement.

     2.6.      PREPAYMENT

               (a)  Optional Prepayment. The Advances, including all accrued
interest thereon, may be prepaid only in whole and not in part at any time,
without premium or penalty; provided that the Borrowers shall give the Lender
not less than one (1) Business Day's written notice prior to making such
prepayment, specifying the amount to be prepaid and the date of prepayment. Each
such notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable upon receipt by the Lender.

               (b)  Mandatory Prepayments.

                   (i)    Commencing January 1, 2005, the Borrowers shall, on or
               before March 31st of each calendar year, prepay all or part of
               the amount of any outstanding Advances, including all accrued
               interest thereon, without premium or penalty, in an amount equal
               to the lesser of (x) fifty percent (50%) of Excess Cash for the
               fiscal year most recently then ended, and (y) the amount
               necessary to prepay the Obligations in full.

                   (ii)   In the event that a Borrower shall, without the
               Lender's prior written consent, directly or indirectly,
               consolidate or merge with or into another entity (whether or not
               such Borrower is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign,
               transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
               of its properties or assets, in any such case, other than in
               connection with a Parent Company Merger or a consolidation or
               merger permitted under Section 13.2 hereof or under any Agreement
               Guarantee, then the Advances shall be immediately prepaid in
               whole, including all interest thereon, without premium or
               penalty.

               (c)  Loan Commitment Termination. Any amounts prepaid pursuant to
this Section 2.6 may not be reborrowed and any prepayment in whole of the
Advances shall constitute a termination of the Loan Commitment.

3.   COLLATERAL

occurred and be continuing and the Obligations shall have been accelerated
(whether by declaration or otherwise) and the Lender shall have delivered a
notice of acceleration to the Collateral Agent, no release of Collateral
pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements or the Security
Agreements shall be effective as against the Lender.

               Upon the payment in full of all Obligations of the Borrowers
under this Agreement, the Lender shall, at the request of either Borrower,

Stock which may be issued in payment of interest on the Advances involves a high
degree of risk including, but not limited to, the following: (i) an investment
in the Borrowers is highly speculative, and only investors who can afford the

accepting the Class A Common Stock; (ii) the Lender may not be able to liquidate
its investment; (iii) transferability of the Class A Common Stock is restricted;
(iv) in the event of a disposition of the Class A Common Stock, the Lender could

any Advance and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by a Borrower or any of
its Material Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by a Borrower
or any of its Material Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now
exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default results in the
acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity or is caused by
a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default") and, in each
case, either (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
$10,000,000 or more or (ii) such Indebtedness constitutes Indebtedness under the

liability in writing);

               Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken
               as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary or for all
               or substantially all of the property of a Borrower or any of its
               Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken
               as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or

                    (iii) orders the liquidation of a Borrower or any of its
               Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken

deny or disaffirm its obligations under its Agreement Guarantee.

     8.2.      ACCELERATION.

               If (i) any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
specified in clause (f) or (g) of Section 8.1 hereof with respect to a Borrower,
any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Significant Subsidiaries that, taken
as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing
and (ii) the Indebtedness under the Note Purchase Agreement shall have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 8.2 thereof, the Lender may declare the
Obligations to be due and payable immediately. Upon any such declaration, the
principal amount of the Advances, together with all interest accrued thereon,
shall become due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an
Event of Default specified in clause (f) or (g) of Section 8.1 hereof occurs
with respect to a Borrower, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any group of
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary,
the outstanding principal amount of the Advances shall be due and payable
immediately without further action or notice. The Lender may rescind an
acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree. and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of
principal amount, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the
acceleration) have been cured or waived.

                                       15

<PAGE>

     8.3.      OTHER REMEDIES.

               If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Lender may
pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal and interest
on the Advances or to enforce the performance of any provision of this
Agreement, the Agreement Guarantees, and the Security Agreements (subject to the
Intercreditor Agreements).

               A delay or omission by the Lender in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

     8.4.      WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.

               Lender may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences hereunder. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist,
and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured
for every purpose of this Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any waiver
of a Default or Event of Default under the Note Purchase Agreement shall
automatically constitute a waiver of all Defaults or Event of Defaults hereunder
that arise out of the same event or occurrence.

9.   PRIORITY OF OBLIGATIONS

               The Obligations shall rank equal to all Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to the Concurrent Financing Transactions and all Indebtedness under the
Prior Indenture.

relating to this Agreement, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of
outside counsel for the Lender.

by the Lender or on the Lender's behalf and any disposition or payment.

instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written

                           FORM OF AGREEMENT GUARANTEE

               This Agreement Guarantee is delivered by the undersigned (the
"Subsidiary Guarantor") pursuant to the Credit Agreement dated as of __________,
2003 among XM Satellite Radio Inc., XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and General
Motors Corporation (the "Credit Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.

               For value received, the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby fully and
unconditionally guarantees to the Lender that: (a) the principal amount of, and
premium and interest on, the Advances will be duly and punctually paid in full
when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on
overdue principal and premium amount and (to the extent permitted by law)
interest on any interest, if any, on the Advances and all other obligations of
the Borrowers to the Lender under the Credit Agreement or the Security
Agreements (including fees, expenses or other) will be promptly paid in full or
performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case
of any extension of time of payment or renewal of the Advances or any of such
other obligations the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed
in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at the
Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof, the
Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention of such parties that the
guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement Guarantee not
constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy
Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act
or any similar federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the
Lender and the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the
obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement Guarantee shall be
limited to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that, after giving effect to
all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Subsidiary Guarantor and after
giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any
other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other
Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement Guarantee, the obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement Guarantee do not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under applicable law.

               Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or failing
performance of any other obligation of the Borrowers to the Lender, for whatever
reason, the Subsidiary Guarantor will be obligated to pay or to perform or to
cause the performance of, the same immediately without the necessity of any
action by the Lender. An Event of Default under the Credit Agreement shall
constitute an event of default under this Agreement Guarantee, and shall entitle
the Lender to accelerate the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder
in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Borrowers.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations
hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Credit Agreement, the absence of any action to enforce the
same, any waiver or consent by the Lender with respect to any thereof, the entry
of any judgment against a Borrower, any action to enforce the same or any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes: (a) any
right to require the Lender to proceed against the Borrowers, any other
Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any
security held by or on behalf of the Lender at any time or to pursue any other
remedy in any secured party's power before proceeding against the Subsidiary
Guarantor; (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of
authority, death or disability of any other Person or Persons or the failure of
the Lender to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration,
bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other Person or Persons; (c) demand,
protest and notice of any kind, including but not limited to notice of the
existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional Indebtedness or
obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of the Subsidiary
Guarantor, the Borrowers, the Lender, any creditor of the Subsidiary Guarantor
or on the part of any other Person whomsoever in connection with any obligations
the performance of which are hereby guaranteed; (d) any defense based upon an
election of remedies by the Lender, including but not limited to an election to
proceed

<PAGE>

against the Subsidiary Guarantor for reimbursement; (e) any defense
based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a
surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome
than that of the principal; (f) any defense arising because of the Lender's
election, in any proceeding instituted under the United States Bankruptcy Code
(the "Bankruptcy Code"), of the application of Section 1111 (b)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code; and (g) any defense based on any borrowing or grant of a
security interest under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby covenants that this Agreement
Guarantee will not be discharged except by payment in full of all principal and
interest on the Advances and all other costs provided for under the Credit
Agreement, or as provided in Section 13.3 of the Credit Agreement.

               If the Lender is required by any court or otherwise to return to
either the Borrowers or the Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, or
similar official acting in relation to the Borrowers or the Subsidiary
Guarantor, any amount paid by the Borrowers or the Subsidiary Guarantor to the
Lender, this Agreement Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect. The Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it
will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Lender in
respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all
obligations guaranteed hereby.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one
hand, and the Lender, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 8 of the Credit
Agreement for the purposes hereof, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations
as provided in Section 8 of the Credit Agreement, such obligations (whether or
not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary
Guarantor for the purpose of this Agreement Guarantee.

               The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges that it shall not
consolidate or merge with or into a corporation or any other entity other than a
Borrower or another Subsidiary Guarantor (whether or not affiliated with the
Subsidiary Guarantor), or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to a
corporation or any other entity other than a Borrower or another Subsidiary
Guarantor (whether or not affiliated with the Subsidiary Guarantor), unless this
Agreement Guarantee shall be expressly assumed (in the event that the Subsidiary
Guarantor is not the surviving corporation in the merger) or a new Agreement
Guarantee shall be signed by such successor corporation or other entity and
delivered to the Lender. Any Agreement Guarantee so issued shall in all respects
have the same legal rank and benefit under the Credit Agreement as any Agreement
Guarantee theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement as though all of such Agreement Guarantees had been issued at
the date of the execution thereof.

               This Agreement Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Subsidiary Guarantor has
caused this Agreement Guarantee to be duly executed as of __________, 200_.
