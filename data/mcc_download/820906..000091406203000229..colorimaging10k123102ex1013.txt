                     AMENDMENT OF COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

     THIS AMENDMENT OF COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT (this  "Amendment") is made as
of February 05, 2003, between KINGS BROTHERS, LLC ("Lessor"),  a Georgia limited
liability company, and COLOR IMAGING,  INC. ("Lessee"),  a Delaware Corporation,
successor by merger to Color Image, Inc., a Georgia corporation, as follows:

     Recitals. Lessor and Lessee are parties to a Commercial Lease Agreement (as
amended  prior to the date hereof,  the "Lease")  dated as of April 1, 1999,  as
amended by First Amendment  thereto (the "First  Amendment")  dated as of May 1,
1999, regarding premises in Gwinnett County,  Georgia.  They desire to amend the
lease to extend the expiration date of the term of the Lease.

     NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of TEN DOLLARS ($10) and other good
and  valuable  consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby
acknowledged,  Lessor  and  Lessee,  intending  to be  legally  bound,  agree as
follows:

     1. Recitals;  Definitions.  The foregoing  provisions and recitals are true
and  correct  and  are  hereby  incorporated  herein  by  this  reference.   All
capitalized  terms utilized herein,  not defined herein but defined in the Lease
shall have the definitions ascribed thereto in the Lease.

     2. Term.  Section 3 of the Lease and Section 3 of the First  Amendment  are
hereby each amended by inserting "March 31, 2013" in lieu of "March 31, 2009."

     3. Rent.  Section 3 of the Lease (prior to the First  Amendment) sets forth
the rental  schedule  for the  premises  described  therein and Section 4 of the
First  Amendment  sets forth the rental for the  additional  premises  described
therein.  From and after the date hereof,  Lessee shall pay rent  (inclusive  of
common area  charges,  including  but not limited to real and personal  property
taxes,  central station monitoring of both burglary and fire alarms and Lessee's
pro rata share of Lessor's  fire,  liability  and other  insurance  expenses) in
regard  to  both  the  premises  described  in the  Lease  (prior  to the  First
Amendment)  and the  additional  premises  described  in the First  Amendment as
follows:

     a.   Commencing  on March 1, 2003 and  continuing on the first (1st) day of
          each calendar month thereafter through and including December 1, 2003,
          Lessee shall pay rent in equal  monthly  installments  of $44,287 each
          (Lessee  having  paid  monthly  rental  in such  amount  as of each of
          January 1 and February 1, 2003);

     b.   Commencing on January 1, 2004,  and  continuing on the first (1st) day
          of each calendar month  thereafter  through and including  December 1,
          2004,  Lessee shall pay rent in equal monthly  installments of $45,394
          each;

     c.   Commencing on each anniversary of January 1, 2004,  during the term of
          this Lease,  and  continuing  on the first (1st) day of each  calendar
          month thereafter through and including the next succeeding  December 1
          (or,  if  earlier,  March 1,  2009),  Lessee  shall  pay rent in equal
          monthly  installments equal to the sum of (a) the monthly  installment

          amount (the "Prior Payment  Amount")  payable  during the  immediately
          preceding  calendar  year  plus (b) the  product  equal  to the  Prior
          Payment Amount multiplied by 2.5%;

     c.   Commencing  on April 1, 2009 and  continuing on the first (1st) day of
          each calendar month thereafter through and including December 1, 2009,
          Lessee  shall  pay rent in  equal  monthly  installments  equal to the
          lesser of (i) $51,359 or (ii) Lessor's good faith determination of the
          fair market monthly rental rate for the aggregate premises as of April
          1, 2009; and

     d.   Commencing on January 1, 2010 and continuing on the first (1st) day of
          each  calendar  month  thereafter   through  and  including  the  next
          succeeding  December 1 (this date being  March 1 for the year in which
          this Lease, as may be extended or renewed,  expires), Lessee shall pay
          rent in equal monthly  installments  equal to the sum of (a) the Prior
          Payment  Amount plus (b) the product equal to the Prior Payment Amount
          multiplied by 2.5%.

     3.  Reaffirmation.  Lessor and Lessee  reaffirm the Lease and all terms and
provisions thereof, as amended by this Amendment.

     4. Lender.  The Lease,  as amended  hereby,  is assigned to SouthTrust Bank
("Lender")  pursuant and subject to  Assignment  of Rents and Leases dated as of
March 31, 1999 between Lessor and Lender.  Lender executes this Amendment as set
forth below solely to evidence its consent to the execution and delivery hereof.
Lender's  approval  of this Lease does not waive or modify any  requirements  or
covenants set forth in any loan  agreements or other  agreements  between Lessor
and Lender.

     5.  Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in  counterparts,  all of
which shall collectively constitute one and the same agreement.
