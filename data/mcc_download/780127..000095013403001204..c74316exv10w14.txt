A.       Landlord and Tenant are parties to a Lease dated February 28, 1995 (the

         described in the Lease.

B.       The parties wish to amend certain terms and conditions of the Lease as
         more particularly set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual covenants
herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant agree that the
Lease is hereby amended as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

1.       SECTION 1.2 PREMISES.

         A.       Effective October 15, 2002, the area of the original Premises
                  ("Original Premises") shall be increased by 4,865 square feet
                  of office space in the Building in the area marked "First

                  that CSM Corporation has vacated the approximately 28,826
                  square foot area in the Building in the area marked "Second
                  Expansion Area" on REVISED EXHIBITS A AND B (which shall be no
                  earlier than January 1, 2004), the area of the Premises shall
                  be increased by the 28,826 square foot Second Expansion Area

                  other furnishings ("Furnishings") remaining in the Premises
                  after CSM Corporation vacates therefrom which are the property
                  of Landlord. Upon termination or expiration of the Lease,
                  Tenant shall surrender possession of the Furnishings to

                  the Premises shall be reduced by 4,865 square feet, from

                  responsible for payment of Rent on the First Expansion Area
                  until it vacates and surrenders possession thereof to Landlord
                  broom-clean, in as good as condition that existed on October
                  15, 2002, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and with all of
                  Tenant's belongings removed. In any event, Tenant shall vacate

         Second Expansion Area, payable to Tenant upon receipt of paid invoice

<PAGE>

         Landlord by reason of its ownership, operation or management of the
         Project, including without limitation the so called Minnesota "state
         general tax", and legal fees incurred in connection with actions to

8.       SECTION 14.13 PARKING. The number of underground parking spaces
         provided to Tenant at no charge shall increase from five (5) to thirty
         (30) as of January 1, 2004.

9.       SECTION 14.14 OPTION TO EXTEND. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and
         agree that execution of this Amendment by both parties shall constitute
         Tenant's election to exercise its first of two options to extend the
         term of the Lease as set forth in Section 14.14 of the initial Lease
         dated February 28, 1995. Landlord shall determine the market base

         Lease no earlier than February 1, 2005, and no later than April 30,
         2005.

10.      SECTION 14.16 EXPANSION OPTION. Section 14.16 of the Lease is deleted
         in its entirety and replaced with the following:

                  "14.16 EXPANSION OPTION. During the term of the Lease, Tenant
                  shall have the option to lease space contiguous to the
                  Premises ("Option Space"), in the "As Is" condition, as it
                  becomes available during the term of the Lease, at the market
                  base rent for the Building, as established by Landlord from
                  time to time, in effect at the time of Landlord's notice.
                  Landlord shall provide Tenant written notice of the
                  availability of the Option Space, and Tenant shall have
                  fifteen (15) days from receipt of Landlord's availability
                  notice within which to forward written notice to Landlord of
                  Tenant's irrevocable intent to lease that part of the Option
                  Space described in Landlord's availability notice, with a term
                  commencing no later than sixty (60) days following the date
                  the Option Space actually becomes available, and expiring
                  coterminous with the term of the Lease. In the event that
                  Tenant fails to exercise its option rights described herein,
                  Tenant's option rights shall be null and void. Tenant and
                  Landlord agree that the expiration and renewal of an existing
                  tenant's lease shall not trigger Tenant's rights under this
                  section, and a condition of Tenant's option right shall be
                  that Tenant is not in default under Section 11 of the Lease
                  and that the Lease is in full force and effect. Landlord and
                  Tenant agree and acknowledge that Tenant has received notice
                  of the availability of the 4,865 square foot First Expansion
                  Space and the 2,993 square foot and 4,618 square foot former
                  CSM Corporation space depicted on REVISED EXHIBIT B."

11.      MISCELLANEOUS. Except as otherwise provided herein, all capitalized
         terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Lease.
         Except as specifically modified herein, all of the covenants,
         conditions, and obligations under the Lease shall remain unchanged and
         in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between the terms
         of the Lease and this Amendment, the terms of this Amendment shall
         prevail. This Amendment shall be binding upon the parties hereto and
         their respective successors and assigns. This Amendment may be executed
         in one or more counterparts each of which when so


                                      -4-

         executed and delivered shall constitute an original, but together said
         counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment as of the day and
year first above written.
