Data Products License Agreement                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Data Products License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the
15th day of December, 2002 ("Effective Date") by and between Acxiom Corporation
("Acxiom") and Switchboard, Incorporated ("Customer").

1. GENERAL. "Customer" shall include any legal entities that are controlled by
Customer as of the execution date of this Agreement ("Subsidiaries"), provided,
that Customer shall include a list of Customer's current Subsidiaries on the
applicable Product Schedule (as defined below) prior to execution of this
Agreement. Customer guarantees its Subsidiaries' obligations under this
Agreement.

2. TERM / RENEWAL / TERMINATION.

         2.1 This Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue
until the last remaining effective Product Schedule expires or is terminated.
The term of a Product Schedule shall be set forth in the Product Schedule.

         2.2 Subject to Section 2.3, either party may terminate this Agreement
or a Product Schedule in the event the other party is in default under Section
8.3 below or any other provision of this Agreement or the respective Product
Schedule and fails to cure such default within thirty (30) days of written
notice from the other party specifying the nature of such default.

         2.3 In the event of a termination of the Agreement and in the event
that any Product Schedule is still in effect as of the effective date of such
termination, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect
to such Product Schedule and until such Product Schedule is terminated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Product Schedule.

         2.4 In the event that legislation, governmental regulations, or
industry self-regulation prohibits the delivery or use of a Product, Acxiom may
terminate this Agreement or the applicable Product Schedule upon the effective
date of such legislation or regulations. In the event of such termination Acxiom
shall refund to Customer a portion of the fees paid to date for the Product(s)
in question, on a prorated basis, calculated monthly. If Acxiom should
voluntarily withdraw a Product due to legislative, regulatory, or industry
mandates, Acxiom may terminate this Agreement or the applicable Product Schedule
upon six (6) months prior written notice, and Customer shall discontinue using
the Data (as defined below) at the end of such six-month period. For purposes of
this section, industry, will mean any entity that collects, compiles and/or
discloses by means of sale or otherwise information.

         2.5 Upon the termination of this Agreement or a Product Schedule for
any reason, Customer shall destroy or return to Acxiom the respective Data and
any copies thereof and certify in a writing to be delivered to Acxiom within ten
(10) business days following such destruction or return that the Customer has
fully complied with the requirements of this Section. Upon termination, Customer
shall promptly pay to Acxiom any outstanding fees owed to Acxiom. In no event
shall Customer be entitled to a refund of amounts paid, except as specifically
provided in this Agreement.

3. PRODUCTS / PAYMENT.

         3.1 Subject to the license granted in Section 5, Acxiom shall provide
(i) data ("Data") contained in the Acxiom products ("Products") described in one
or more Product schedules ("Product Schedules") executed by the parties and
incorporated herein by reference; and (ii) the Data processing services, if any,
described in the Product Schedules in connection therewith. In the event a
conflict arises between the terms of any Product Schedule and the Agreement, the
terms of the Product Schedule shall prevail.

         3.2 Customer agrees to pay Acxiom for the Products in accordance with
the payment terms set forth in the Product Schedule. In the event of a good
faith dispute as to the calculation of an invoice, Customer shall promptly give
written notice to Acxiom stating the details of any such dispute and shall
promptly pay any undisputed amount. The acceptance by Acxiom of such partial
payment shall not constitute a waiver of payment in full by Customer of the
disputed amount.

         3.3 Any undisputed amounts not paid within thirty (30) days of the date
of invoice shall accrue interest at a rate of one percent (1%) per month or the
maximum lawful rate, whichever is less. Failure to make timely payments of
undisputed amounts shall constitute a default hereunder and shall entitle
Acxiom, in its sole discretion, to suspend its provision of the Products and
require payment in advance until Customer's account is paid in full.

4. TITLE. Except to the extent that any Product Schedule provides to the
contrary, Customer acknowledges that the Data contained within the Products
shall at all times remain the intellectual property of Acxiom or the third party
data owners who provided the Data to Acxiom ("Data Owners"), and that Customer
has no rights whatsoever in the Data or the Products except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement or the applicable Product Schedule.

5. PRODUCT LICENSE / DELIVERY.

         5.1 License Grant. Acxiom hereby grants and Customer hereby receives a
limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license ("License") to use the Data,
subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Product Schedule.

         5.2 Use by Future Subsidiaries. In the event that any future Subsidiary
of Customer desires to receive the Products from Acxiom, Customer and Acxiom
shall mutually agree upon and execute an amendment to this Agreement and the
applicable Product Schedule, which amendment shall set forth the specific
Products, services and applicable fees related thereto to be licensed to such
Subsidiary by Acxiom.

         5.3 Restrictions. In addition to any restrictions included in a Product
Schedule and except as expressly authorized in a Product Schedule, Customer may
not use the Data as a factor in establishing an individual's creditworthiness or
eligibility for (i) credit or insurance, or (ii) employment.

         5.4 Suppression Files. Unless otherwise directed by Customer in writing
and as applicable to the permitted uses set forth in the Product Schedule,
Acxiom shall automatically apply the Direct Marketing Association's ("DMA") Mail
Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service suppression files, e-mail
suppression files and the state suppression files (the "Suppression Files") to
any prospecting use of the Data not involving Customer's house files to
designate an individual consumer as having opted out of receiving marketing
solicitations. In the event that Customer does not honor such election, that
Customer is made aware of by the appending of a flag by Acxiom, then Acxiom may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 2 and without any further liability
to Customer. Further, due to the varying publication dates of updates to the
Suppression Files, Customer acknowledges that Acxiom cannot guarantee that the
names or telephone numbers of all such consumers have been identified on or
deleted from the Products supplied to Customer hereunder.
<PAGE>

         5.5 Consumer Inquiries. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable
Product Schedule, Customer shall be responsible for accepting and responding to
any communication initiated by a consumer ("Consumer Inquiries") arising out of
Customer's use of the Data. Customer agrees that it will implement a "consumer
care" system that includes in-house capabilities to suppress consumer
information, upon request by a consumer, from future marketing initiatives by
Customer. Customer agrees to honor such consumer's request to opt-out of
receiving telemarketing, e-mail marketing and direct marketing solicitations by
suppressing such consumer information from Customer's marketing solicitations.
Customer may communicate to Acxiom records of the deceased and only Consumer
Inquiries that are determined to involve the accuracy of the Data. No reference
to Acxiom in written or oral communication to a consumer or in scripts used by
Customer in responding to Consumer Inquiries shall be made without Acxiom's
prior written approval. The parties agree that the previous sentence has no
bearing on Products provided for display on the internet and that have the
requirement in the applicable Product Schedule of placing a logo hyper-linked to
www.databyacxiom.com or other Acxiom page. Acxiom may from time to time, upon
specific request from consumers, provide corrections to the Data to Customer,
and Customer further agrees to update its records upon receipt of such
corrections.

         5.6 Third Party Restrictions. Because certain portions of the Data are
from Data Owners, Acxiom is obligated to comply with certain restrictions and
requirements placed upon the use of such information by these third parties.
Customer shall comply within 90 days of notice by Acxiom with all restrictions
and requirements, set forth in the applicable Product Schedule, now or hereafter
imposed upon Acxiom by any Data Owner with respect to any particular Data and
made known to Customer in a writing which includes identification of the Data in
question.

         5.7 Delivery. In the event that Acxiom provides the Products to
Customer electronically, Customer acknowledges that certain mechanical or
software failures may render an electronic transmission medium unavailable for
periods of time and that Acxiom may not be able to provide advance warning to
Customer of such downtime. Acxiom shall make a reasonable attempt to provide
Customer with advance notice of downtime.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY.

         6.1 The Data provided to Customer by Acxiom or any proprietary or
confidential information provided hereunder by one party ("Disclosing Party") to
the other ("Receiving Party") shall be held in strict confidence by the
Receiving Party and shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose other than as
specifically authorized by the Disclosing Party or as expressly provided in this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The
Receiving Party shall exercise at least the same degree of care with which it
protects its own confidential or proprietary information, but not less than a
reasonable degree of care, to ensure compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement respecting the authorized use, protection and security of the
Disclosing Party's confidential information, and to this end shall instruct its
employees and all other parties who have a need to know and are permitted access
to the Disclosing Party's confidential information of the restrictions contained
in this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6 shall restrict the receiving party
with respect to information or data, whether or not identical or similar to that
contained in the confidential information, if such information or data: (a) was
rightfully possessed by the receiving party before it was received from the
disclosing party; (b) is independently developed by the receiving party without
reference to the disclosing party's information or data; (c) is subsequently
furnished to the receiving party by a third party not under any obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information or data, and without
restrictions on use or disclosure; or (d) is or becomes public or available to
the general public otherwise than through any act or default of the receiving
party.

         6.2      Customer agrees not to remove any product identification,
copyright or other proprietary notices from the Products.

         6.3 Customer agrees that no part of the Products will be used in the
development of (i) any application that is outside the scope of this Agreement
or applicable Product Schedule or (ii) any products or services to be provided
to third parties including, without limitation, any list enhancement or data
appending service or product, unless otherwise permitted in the applicable
Product Schedule.

7. PRIVACY / DATA PROTECTION. The parties agree to comply with all privacy and
data protection laws, rules and regulations, and with the DMA's published
policies, which are or which may in the future be applicable to the Data. The
parties agree to assist each other in the ongoing effort to stay in compliance
with industry and governmental policies and regulations.

its properties or nature of its operations requires such qualification; (iii) it
has full power and authority to enter into and perform the Agreement; (iv) the

free. Neither Acxiom nor the Data Owners attempt to independently verify the
completeness, accuracy or authenticity of the Data. In addition, the Data

and transmission errors. Accordingly, the Data is provided on an "as is," "as
available" basis. Any use or reliance upon the Data by Customer or its customers

updates thereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may cause

law. In addition to all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law or
in equity, Acxiom further agrees that Customer shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief in the event that Acxiom fails to provide the Data or updates

CUSTOMER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE AND HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOST INCOME OR LOST REVENUE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY. Any cause of action arising from or in connection with this
Agreement shall be asserted within one (1) year of the date upon which such

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

         12.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all
written or oral prior agreements between the parties with respect to this
subject matter. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, notwithstanding any conflict of law
provisions, and any amendment shall be in writing and signed by authorized
representatives of all parties.

         12.2 To assist Acxiom in the protection of its proprietary rights in
the Data, Customer shall permit representatives of Acxiom to inspect at all
reasonable times any location where the Data is being used or kept by Customer.
Customer agrees to notify Acxiom of any actual or suspected unauthorized use or
disclosure of the Data and provide reasonable assistance to Acxiom in the
investigation and prosecution of any such unauthorized use or disclosure. Such
inspection shall be strictly limited to those books and records that
specifically relate to information pertinent to the use of the Data. The parties
agree that any such inspection shall be conducted in a manner that does not
disrupt Customer's normal operating procedures, and shall not violate any other
obligations that Customer has to its customers or other third parties.

         12.3 Customer acknowledges that damages would not adequately compensate
Acxiom for loss or injury resulting from a breach of the provisions of this
Agreement. Acxiom shall have the right to injunctive and other equitable relief
to remedy such violations, in addition to any remedies available to Acxiom at
law or in equity.

         12.4 Customer may not assign, delegate or transfer, by operation of
law, merger, sale or otherwise, this Agreement or any of the rights or
obligations hereunder, without the express prior written consent of Acxiom,

Customer is not the surviving entity and the acquiring entity is not a
Competitor of Acxiom. For purposes of this Section 12.4, "Competitor" shall be
defined as any company which is listed in Attachment 2 and the parties agree to
amend this list upon Acxiom's discovery of new Competitors in order to include
such new Competitors.

         12.5 If any one or more of the provisions of the Agreement shall for
any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not
affect any of the other portions of the Agreement. Failure or delay by either
party in exercising any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such
right. The headings used in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not be deemed a substantive part of this Agreement.

         12.6 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
including facsimile copies, each of which may be executed by less than all of
the parties hereto, each of which shall be enforceable with respect to the
parties actually executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall
constitute one document.

         12.7 PUBLICITY. Neither party shall have the right to create and
publish its own press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and/or
relationship between the parties established hereunder, without the prior
written approval of the other party. Acxiom may include Customer on its customer

limited to by way of predictions or projections of future business).

arising out of the delay or interruption of its performance of obligations under

public enemy, war, riot, flood, civil commotion, insurrection, severe weather
conditions, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party
delayed.
