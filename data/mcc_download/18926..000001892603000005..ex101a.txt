                                AMENDMENTS TO THE
                                CENTURYTEL, INC.
                          EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

STATE OF LOUISIANA

PARISH OF OUACHITA

         BE IT KNOWN, that on this 31st day of December, 2002, before me, a
Notary Public, duly commissioned and qualified in and for the Parish of
Ouachita, State of Louisiana, therein residing, and in the presence of the
undersigned witnesses:

         PERSONALLY CAME AND APPEARED:
         CENTURYTEL,  INC., represented herein by its Executive Vice-President
and Chief Financial Officer, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., as Plan Sponsor, which
hereby executes the following amendments to the CenturyTel, Inc. Employee Stock
Ownership Plan:

         1.   Preamble:

         "These amendments to the Plan are adopted to reflect certain provisions
         of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
         ("EGTRRA"). These amendments are intended to constitute good faith
         compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA and are to be construed in
         accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as
         otherwise provided herein, each amendment shall be effective as of the
         first day of the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2001."

         2.   Section 4.12(d) is hereby amended to read as follows:

         "(d) Defined contribution dollar limitation: $30,000, as adjusted under
         Code Section 415(d). For Limitation Years beginning after December 31,
         2001, the limitation shall be $40,000, as adjusted for increases in the
         cost-of-living under Section 415(d) of the Code."

         3.   The first paragraph of Section 4.12(k) is hereby amended to read
         as follows:

         "(k) Maximum permissible amount: The maximum annual addition that may
         be contributed or allocated to a Participant's Account under the Plan
         for any Limitation Year shall not exceed the lesser of:

         (i)  The defined contribution dollar limitation, or

         (ii) Twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant's compensation
              for the Limitation Year. For Plan Years beginning after
              December 31, 2001, this percentage shall be one hundred
              percent (100%)."

         4.   Insert the following as the fifth paragraph of Section 1.7:

         "For Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, the annual
         compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining
         allocations for any Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2001, shall
         not exceed $200,000 as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in
         accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Annual compensation means
         compensation during the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month
         period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan
         (the determination period). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for
         a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination
         period that begins with or within such calendar year."

         5.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 16.1:

         "For Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, any Employee or
         former Employee (including any deceased Employee) who at any time
         during the Plan Year that includes the determination date was an
         officer of the Employer having annual compensation greater than
         $130,000 (as adjusted under Code Section 416(i)(1) for Plan Years
         beginning after December 31, 2002), a 5-percent owner of the Employer,
         or a 1-percent owner of the Employer having annual compensation of more
         than $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation means compensation
         within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3). The determination of who
         is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with Code Section
         416(i)(1) and the applicable regulations and other guidance of general
         applicability issued thereunder."

         6.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 16.5(c):

         "For Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, for purposes of (a)
         and (b), above, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply. The
         present value of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances
         of an Employee as of the determination date shall be increased by the
         distributions made with respect to the Employee under the plan and any
         plan aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 416(g)(2) during the
         1-year period ending on the determination date. The preceding sentence
         shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it
         not been terminated, would have been aggregated with the Plan under
         Code Section 416(g)(2)(A)(i). In the case of a distribution made for a
         reason other than severance from employment, death, or disability, this
         provision shall be applied by substituting `5-year period' for `1-year
         period.' The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has
         not performed services for the Employer during the 1-year period ending
         on the determination date shall not be taken into account."

         7.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 7.6(b)(i):

         "For distributions made after December 31, 2001, a portion of a
         distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
         merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions
         which are not includable in gross income. However, such portion may be
         transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity
         described in Code Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined
         contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a) or 403(a) that
         agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including
         separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is
         includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which
         is not so includable."

         8.   Insert the following as the second paragraph of Section 7.6
         (b)(ii):

         "For distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement
         plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section
         403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is
         maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency
         or any instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state
         and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
         such plan from this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan
         shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse,
         or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a
         qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p)."

         9.   Insert the following at the end of Section 7.2(a):

         "For purposes of this Section, and Section 7.3, the value of a
         Participant's nonforfeitable account balance shall be determined
         without regard to that portion of the account balance that is
         attributable to rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto)
         within the meaning of Code Sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8),
         408(d)(3)(A)(ii) and 457(e)(16). If the value of the Participant's
         nonforfeitable account balance as so determined is $5,000 or less, the
         Plan may immediately distribute the Participant's entire nonforfeitable
         account balance."

         10.  Section 1.7 is amended by inserting the following as the last
         paragraph thereof:

         "For Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for purposes of
         the definition of compensation contained in this Section 1.7, and
         Sections 1.17, 1.19(b), 4.12(b) and 16.8 of the Plan, compensation paid
         or made available during such years shall include elective amounts that
         are not includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of
         Code Section 132(f)(4)."


         THUS DONE AND SIGNED on the day first above shown, in the presence of
the undersigned competent witnesses, who hereunto sign their names with the said
appearer and me, Notary, after reading of the whole.
