<U>Statement of Purpose</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Plan is to provide a system of incentive compensation which will promote the maximization of shareholder value over the long term.  In order to align management incentives with shareholder interests, incentive compensation will reward the creation of value.  This Plan will tie incentive compensation to Economic Value Added ("EVA") and, thereby, reward management for creating value and penalize management for destroying value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVA is the performance measure of value creation.  EVA reflects the benefits and costs of capital employment.  Managers create value when they employ capital in an endeavor that generates a return that exceeds the cost of the capital employed.  Managers destroy value when they employ capital in an endeavor that generates a return that is less than the cost of capital employed.  By imputing the cost of capital upon the operating profits generated by a business group, EVA measures the total value created (or destroyed) by management.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVA  =  (Net Operating Profit After Tax - Capital Charge)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Plan Participant is placed in a classification.  Each classification has a prescribed target bonus %. The bonus earned in any one year is the result of multiplying the Actual Bonus Percentage times the Participant's base pay.   Bonuses that fall within a pre-specified range will be fully paid out.  Positive and negative bonuses falling outside this range are banked forward in the Participant's Bonus Bank, with one-third of the net positive balance paid out each year in cash.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless the context provides a different meaning, the following terms shall have the following meanings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Participating Group</U>" means a business division or group of business divisions which are uniquely identified for the purpose of calculating EVA and EVA based bonus awards.  Some Participants' awards may be a mixture of more than one Participating Group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this plan, the Participating Groups are listed on Exhibit C.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Capital</U>" means the net investment employed in the operations of each Participating Group.  The components of Capital are as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross Accounts Receivable (including trade A/R from another Manitowoc unit)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIFO Inventory<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Current Assets<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Interest Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL's - See Note 1)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net PP&amp;E<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Assets<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized Research &amp; Development<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill acquired after July 3, 1993<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated Amortization on Goodwill acquired after July 3, 1993<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Plus (Less):  Special Items (one-time)</U><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equals:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) NIBCL's include trade A/P to another Manitowoc unit, but do not include the contingent liability associated with Bonus Banks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each component of Capital will be measured by computing an average balance based on the ending monthly balance for the twelve months of the Fiscal Year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Cost of Capital</U>" or "<U>C*</U>" means the weighted average of the after tax cost of debt and equity for the year in question.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Cost of Capital will be reviewed annually and revised if it has changed significantly.  Calculations will be carried to one decimal point.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of capital for the initial year is 12.6%.  See Exhibit A.  In subsequent plan years the methodology for the calculation of the Cost of Capital will be:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a)   Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Beta x Market Risk Premium)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b)   Debt Cost of Capital = Debt Yield x (1 - Tax Rate) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c)   The weighted average of the Cost of Equity and the Debt Cost of Capital is determined by reference to a projected debt to capital ratio of 40%.  The Risk Free Rate is the average  daily closing yield rate on 30 year U.S. Government Bonds for the month of December immediately preceding the Plan Year, the BETA is one, and the Market Risk Premium is 5%.  The Debt Yield is the projected weighted average yield on the Company's long term obligations for the 12 month period ending December 31 of the Plan Year, and the tax rate is 39% for U.S. Companies, and the full statutory rate of the country where a foreign division or subsidiary is based.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debt to capital ratio, BETA, and Market Risk Premium should be reviewed at least every three years with the assistance of an independent compensation consulting firm.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)  Short-term debt is to be treated as long-term for purposes of computing the cost of capital.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Capital Charge</U>"  means the deemed opportunity cost of employing Capital in the business of each Participating Group.  The Capital Charge is computed as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Charge = Capital <B>x</B> Cost of Capital (C*)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Net Operating Profit After Tax" </U>or "<U>NOPAT</U>"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"NOPAT" means the after tax cash earnings attributable to the capital employed in the Participating Group for the year in question.  The components of NOPAT are as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating Earnings<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase (Decrease) in Capitalized R &amp; D (See Note 1)<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase (Decrease) in Inventory Reserves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortization of Goodwill acquired after July 3, 1993<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other  Expense (Excluding interest on debt)<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Target EVA" means the level of EVA that is expected in order for the Participating Group to receive the Target Bonus Value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Target EVA for a participating group's initial year is set by looking at historical levels of EVA achieved by the group, expectations going forward, amount of capital utilized in the business and level of seasonality, cyclicality and risk.  An independent compensation consulting firm assists in setting these initial year targets. </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first year, the Base-Line EVA is revised according to the following formula:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Target EVA = Last Year's Actual EVA+ Expected Improvement in EVA</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expected Improvement in EVA" means the constant EVA improvement that is added to shift the target up each year.  This is determined by the expected growth in EVA per year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Exhibit C for the Expected Improvement for each Participating Group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Target Bonus Value" means the "Target Bonus Percentage" times a Participant's base pay.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Target Bonus Percentage" is determined by a Participant's classification as shown on Exhibit B. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actual Bonus Value" means the bonus earned (*) by a Participant and is computed as the Actual Bonus Percentage times a Participant's base pay.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actual Bonus Percentage" is determined by multiplying the Target Bonus Percentage by the Bonus Performance Value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bonus Performance Value" means the difference between the Actual EVA and the Target EVA divided by the Leverage Factor plus 1.0.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leverage Factor" is the negative (positive) deviation from Target EVA necessary before a zero (two times Target) bonus is earned.  See Exhibit C for the Leverage Factor of each Participating Group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant's classification is determined by each business unit manager.  They are subject to approval by the CEO and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.</P>

To encourage a long-term commitment by Participants to the Company, a portion of exceptional bonuses (amounts above Target as well as negative bonuses) shall be credited to "at risk" deferred accounts ("Bonus Banks"), with the level of payout contingent on sustained high performance and improvements and continued employment as provided herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a Bonus Bank may, as a result of negative EVA, have a deficit, no Plan Participant shall be required, at any time, to reimburse his/her Bonus Bank.</P>
