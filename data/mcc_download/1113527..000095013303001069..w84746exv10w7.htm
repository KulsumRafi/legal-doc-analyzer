compensation opportunity (it being understood that a reduction in the dollar

bonus opportunity) or the benefits to be made available pursuant to Section
3(d); or (iii)&nbsp;a material breach by of any other provision of the Agreement, in
each case that is not cured by the Company within 30&nbsp;days of receipt of prior

protect the legitimate interests of the Company without unreasonably

business in the Company&#146;s business plan, in each case determined as of the Date
of Termination (the &#147;Business&#148;), provided that the foregoing shall not apply if
the Executive&#146;s interest or association with such competitor is unrelated to
the Business; provided, further, that the foregoing the &#147;Business&#148; shall not be
deemed to include cable television services or programming, broadcast
television, internet access or content or consumer wireless communications or

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive provisions of this Agreement shall not prohibit the

any corporation engaged in the Business, which securities are listed on a
recognized securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market to the
extent that such interest does not exceed 2% of the value or voting power of
such corporation and does not constitute control of such corporation. For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;6 and Sections&nbsp;7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement, the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that
all material information that is not publicly available or generally known in
the industry concerning the Company&#146;s business including, without limitation,
information relating to its products, customer lists, pricing, trade secrets,
patents, business methods, and cost data, business plans and strategies
(collectively, the &#147;Confidential Information&#148;) is and shall remain the property
of the Company. The Executive recognizes and agrees that all of the material
Confidential Information, whether developed by the Executive or made available
to the Executive, other than information that is not material to the Company or
generally known to the public or generally known in the industry, is a unique
asset of the business of the company, the disclosure of which would be damaging
to the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees to hold such material
Confidential Information in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company. The Executive agrees that he will not at any time during or within 10
years after the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company for any reason,
directly or indirectly, disclose to any Person any material Confidential
Information the disclosure of which could harm the Company, other than
information that is already known to the public or generally know in the
industry, except as may be required in the ordinary course of business of the
Company or as may be required by law. Promptly upon the termination of this
Agreement for any reason, the Executive agrees to return to the Company any and
all documents, memoranda, drawings, notes and other papers and items (including
all copies thereof, whether electronic or otherwise) embodying any Confidential
Information of the Company which are in the possession or control of the
Executive. Information concerning the Company&#146;s business that becomes public
as a result of the Executive&#146;s breach of this Section&nbsp;7 shall be treated as
Confidential Information this Section&nbsp;7. The Executive shall not be deemed to
have breached this Section&nbsp;7 unless the disclosure of such Confidential
Information actually causes harm to the Company or any of its affiliates.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of Certain Provisions. The Executive acknowledges that a
violation on the Executive&#146;s part of any of the covenants contained in Sections
6 or 7 of this Agreement would cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the
Company. The Executive represents that his economic means and circumstances
are such that the provisions of this Agreement, including the non-competition,
non-solicitation of employees, confidentiality and Company property provisions,
will not prevent him from providing for himself and his family on a basis
satisfactory to him and them. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that the
Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction for any actual or threatened violation of any such covenant in
addition to any other remedies it may have. The Executive agrees that in the
event that any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction shall finally hold
that any provision of Sections&nbsp;6 or 7 hereof is void or constitutes an
unreasonable restriction against the Executive, the provisions of such Section
shall not be rendered void but shall apply to such extent as such arbitrator or
court may determine constitutes a reasonable restriction under the
circumstances. Any breach by the Executive of the provisions of Sections&nbsp;6 or
7 of this Agreement shall relieve the Company of all obligations to any further
payments to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement (including under all
Company equity award grants pursuant to Section&nbsp;3) or otherwise under any
incentive or equity awards made by the Company and, in the case of a breach of
Section&nbsp;6 of this Agreement, shall entitle the Company to repayment from the
Executive, upon demand, of all amounts previously paid to the Executive
following or in the six months preceding such breach with respect to previously
granted equity awards (i.e., in the case of any stock options, the net gain
realized by the Executive with respect thereto during such period). These
remedies are in addition to any other remedies the Company may have with
respect to any such breach.
