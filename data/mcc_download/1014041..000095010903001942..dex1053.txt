used in this Plan have the meaning set forth in Section 8.

     1. Purpose. The Plan compensates the Company's Non-Employee Directors for

they provide to the Company in that role.

     2. Administration. The Board of Directors and subject to the Board's

Non-Employee Directors.

     3. Terms and Conditions.

        (a) Quarterly Retainer. Beginning with October 1, 2002, and on the first

Non-Employee Director a quarterly retainer for the director's service during the
ensuing quarter. The amount of the quarterly retainer will initially be $6,000,
although the Board of Directors may increase or decrease this amount. If a
Non-Employee Director's membership on the Board of Directors terminates for any
reason during a calendar quarter, the Nonemployee Director may retain the
quarterly retainer for that calendar quarter, but will not be entitled to
payment of any further amounts.

        (b) Meeting Fee. Each Non-Employee Director will be entitled to receive
a meeting fee at each meeting of the Board of Directors or its committees that
the Non-Employee Director attends. The initial meeting fee will be $1,000, but
the Board of Directors may increase or decrease this amount.

     4. Non-Assignability. The Non-Employee Directors may not sell, transfer, or
encumber their rights under the Plan.

     5. Amendment and Termination. The Board of Directors may amend, modify, or
terminate this Plan, although any such action will not impair rights to retainer
or meeting fees already earned under the Plan.

     6. Effective Date. The effective date of this Plan will be October 1, 2002.

     7. Governing Law. This Plan and all actions taken under it will be governed
