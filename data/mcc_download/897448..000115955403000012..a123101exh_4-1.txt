AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual covenants set forth below, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

1. Rights Subject to Option; Information Provided to Amarin.

	1.1	Rights Defined.  For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Rights" shall mean all of Elan's right, title
and interest in any data, information, or know-how pertaining
to, and any license or other rights in, the Product in the
Territory, now owned or controlled or hereafter acquired by
Elan. By way of illustration, the foregoing Rights shall
include but not be limited to (i) all of Elan's rights under
the License and Supply Agreement between Elan or its
affiliates and RP Scherer and Company, as amended (the
"Scherer Agreement"), as it pertains to the Territory, and
(ii) all clinical, preclinical and other data, protocols,
inventory, work in progress, regulatory rights or
applications of any kind (such as a New Drug Application
("NDA") for the Product), contract rights, market research,
patent rights, patent applications, trademark rights,
trademark applications, and any know-how associated with the
Product for use in the Territory.

	1.2	Information.  Elan shall provide Amarin with
continuing access to and, as appropriate, copies or samples of
materials it has within its possession or control which are the
subject of the Rights, together with all additional
information, data, patent or trademark disclosures and know-how
relating thereto now known to or hereafter developed or
obtained by Elan during the Option Period (as defined below)
(the "Information"), all on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

2.	Evaluation by Amarin.

	2.1	Right to Evaluate.  During the Option Period,
Amarin shall have the continuing right to review the
Information as Amarin determines is necessary to evaluate its
interest in exercising the Option.  During the Option Period,
Amarin shall use the Information solely for that purpose.
Elan shall make the Information available at its expense at
800 Gateway Blvd, South San Francisco, California 94080.

	2.2	Return of Information if Option not Exercised.
If Amarin terminates (which can occur only as provided in
Section 8.2 below) or fails to timely exercise the Option,
Amarin shall return to Elan, within thirty (30) days following
the termination of the Option Period, all Information of Elan
and all copies thereof (or Amarin's written confirmation that
it has destroyed all such copies), except for one complete set
of Information which Amarin may retain and use solely for
compliance purposes under the confidentiality requirements of
this Agreement.

3.	Option to License.

	3.1	Grant of Option.

	(a) Elan hereby grants to Amarin the following
exclusive option (the "Option"), during the Option Period,
to obtain an exclusive transfer and assignment of the Rights,
on the terms stated below and in Exhibit A attached hereto and
incorporated by this reference, to use,promote, distribute and
sell the Product in the Territory, for use in the field of
human therapeutic treatment of any disease, condition or
disorder (the "Field"). It is understood and agreed that Elan
retains all rights in the Product outside the Territory which
it now or hereafter may own or control. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the Territory shall mean the United States.

	(b)  This Option is exercisable by written notice to
Elan received at any time during the Option Period.  If Amarin
timely exercises the Option, the parties promptly shall
negotiate in good faith and execute a mutually acceptable
definitive assignment agreement (the "Assignment Agreement")
which shall incorporate the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and shall include other terms and conditions
which are reasonable and customary in transactions of this
nature.

	(c)  If the parties are unable to agree upon the form
of the Assignment Agreement within thirty days of the date of
the exercise of the Option, the parties shall submit any
outstanding issues to senior management of each party, who
shall negotiate in good faith a resolution.  If thirty days
after such submission to senior management issues remain
unresolved, either party may submit its proposed Assignment
Agreement to an arbitrator in the San Francisco, California
area, selected under the then-current Commercial Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, who will select one of the
two proposed agreements, in its entirety.  The arbitrator's
decision will be final, binding and enforceable in a court of
competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, California, which
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.

	(d)  Among other things, the Assignment Agreement shall
provide that Amarin shall assume and perform Elan's obligations
under the Scherer Agreement as of the date of the transfer and
assignment of the Rights; that in the event of a conflict
between the Scherer Agreement and the Assignment Agreement, the
Scherer Agreement shall control; and that the parties shall
cooperate reasonably to enable the other to fulfill their
respective remaining obligations under the Scherer Agreement in
and outside the Territory.

	3.2	Option Period.  The "Option Period" shall mean
the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
expiring at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the day which is the
earlier of the following: (i) thirty (30) days from the date on
which Amarin receives a copy of the written approval of a New
Drug Application ("NDA") by the Food and Drug Administration
("FDA") for immediate marketing of Zelapar in the Territory or
(ii) execution by both parties of the Assignment Agreement.

	3.3	Option Fees.  In full consideration for the
Option granted to Amarin, within three (3) business days of
execution of this Agreement by both parties, Amarin shall pay
to Elan a non-refundable, non-creditable option fee of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

	3.4	Pursuit of New Drug Application.  During the
Option Period, Elan shall be responsible for and shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to diligently pursue the
preparation, submission, acceptance for filing and substantive
review, and approval of an NDA for the Product with the FDA;
shall continue the prosecution and maintenance of all its
patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark
applications included in the Rights; and shall consult with
and consider the reasonable requests of Amarin in connection
with the above. "Commercially Reasonable Efforts" of a Party
shall mean efforts consistent with the exercise of its prudent
business judgment as applied to other clinical, regulatory and
commercialization efforts for products of similar performance
and potential as would be undertaken in the pharmaceutical
industry, but not less than those efforts applied by that Party
to other similar products of its own product line.

4.	Steering Committee.

	4.1  Formation of Steering Committee.  Promptly
following execution of this Agreement, the Parties will agree
on a Zelapar Steering Committee consisting of an equal number
of Elan and Amarin members. The initial chair of the Steering
Committee shall be designated by Elan and shall rotate between
Elan and Amarin at least annually. Elan and Amarin may each
designate a proxy or substitute for its members, and may
substitute its members.

	4.2	Steering Committee Meetings; Project Plan. The
Steering Committee will meet within thirty (30) days of
execution of this Agreement, at 800 Gateway Blvd., South San
Francisco, California 94080, and no less than quarterly
thereafter at a site to be mutually agreed, with minutes and
next quarter objectives to be distributed by the chair and
approved; each party will pay its own expenses in attendance
and related activities. A draft of the plan for completion of
development and approval of an NDA for the Product (the "Plan")
will be drafted by Elan for review and approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld, by Amarin.  The Plan will contain
milestone events and timelines for review and approval by the
Steering Committee. Thereafter, the Plan may be amended only by
majority vote of the Steering Committee. Material deviations in
executing the Plan must be approved in advance by the Steering
Committee. It is understood and agreed that Elan will perform
and manage the day-to-day execution and operations of the Plan.
Disputes not resolved by the Steering Committee within fourteen
(14) days shall be referred to respective company senior
management for good faith discussion and resolution.

	4.3  Project Team.  In addition to the Steering
Committee, Amarin shall be entitled to attend and participate
in and receive all materials provided to Elan's Project Team
for Zelapar.

	4.4 	Expenses.  In return for the consideration
provided under this Agreement upon exercise of the Option,
Elan will bear all costs and expenses (internal and external)
associated with performing its obligations under this
Agreement, including without limitation Section 3.4 above,
and the implementation of the Plan.

rightfully known to or independently developed by the
Recipient, its affiliates or licensees (as shown by its

its affiliates or licensees on an unrestricted basisfrom

shall reconcile any discrepancy found within 30 days of receipt of
the report of the auditor.  Elan's audit right, as described, shall
survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement, such that
Elan's right shall survive one (1) year beyond payment by Amarin of

which Amarin is not the controlling entity.

Dear Rick:

This will confirm the agreement of Elan Pharma International

is attached and incorporated by this reference ("Term Sheet").

In that respect, Elan and Amarin will each use diligent
efforts to negotiate in good faith and enter into a
definitive option agreement (the "Agreement") which, in
addition to the attached terms, will contain such other terms
and conditions as are reasonable and customary in such
transactions.  If the parties do not enter into the Agreement
on or before June 30, 2001, any remaining issues shall then be
referred to senior management for good faith resolution.

The agreed transaction under this letter and the Agreement will
be subject to the consent of any necessary third parties or
governmental entities, including without limitation Scherer DDS,
a division of R.P. Scherer Limited, or its successors in
interest. If required, Elan and Amarin will cooperate to use
diligent efforts to obtain any such consents as soon as is
practical.

This letter expresses our entire agreement on the subject matter,
supersedes any prior agreements (other than the Term Sheet) and
may not be amended except in writing signed by Elan and Amarin.

If the foregoing accurately sets out the agreement between
Amarin and Elan, please sign one of the two original enclosed
copies of this letter and return to me as soon as possible.

Best Regards,

                        outright (the "Purchase Option").
                        Milestone payments are as follows:

                        The initial consideration of
                        $10,000,000 is payable on NDA
                        approval.

                        The second payment of $12,500,000
                        is payable once fiscal Zelapar
                        revenues reach or exceed $15,000,000.

                        The third payment of $15,000,000 is
                        payable once fiscal Zelapar revenues
                        reach or exceed $20,000,000.

                        The fourth payment of $15,000,000 is
                        payable in 2010. This payment can be
                        extended under certain circumstances.

Royalty Payments:       Amarin will pay Elan [    ]% of
                        net sales as a part of the total
                        consideration and this amount can
                        be offset against the fourth
                        payment of $15,000,000. This royalty
                        is payable for eight years from NDA
                        approval.

Research and
Development Costs:      Elan will pay all research,
                        development and filing costs up
                        to and including NDA approval.

Change of Control:      In the event of a Change of
                        Control involving Amarin,
                        including an event that would
                        give rise to the triggering of
                        the CVRs, Elan shall have the
                        right to terminate this agreement
                        in which case all rights to Zelapar
                        will revert to Elan.

Subsequent
Disposal:               Following the exercise of the
                        Purchase Option, Amarin will not
                        dispose of Zelapar to a third
                        party without the prior written
                        consent of Elan.
