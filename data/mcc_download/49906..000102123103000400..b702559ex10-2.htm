  on the Financial Statements to the Members of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC<br>
  </b>We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Imperial Chemical Industries
  PLC and subsidiaries (&#8220;the Group&#8221;) as of 31 December 2002 and 2001
  and the related consolidated profit and loss accounts, statements of total recognised
  gains and losses, statements of cash flow and reconciliations of movements in
  shareholders&#8217; funds for each of the years in the three-year period ended
  31 December 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
  of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
  consolidated financial statements based on our audits.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">We conducted our audits in accordance
  with generally accepted auditing standards in the United Kingdom and the United
  States. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
  misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">In our opinion, the consolidated
  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
  the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2002 and 2001 and the
  results of the Group&#8217;s operations and cash flows for each of the years
  in the three-year period ended 31 December 2002, in conformity with generally
  accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom. <br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> As more fully described in note 1 to
  the financial statements, the Group has adopted FRS 19 &#8216;Deferred Tax&#8217;
  in the year ended 31 December 2002. Consequently, the Group&#8217;s financial
  statements as of 31 December 2001 and 2000, and for each of the years in the
  two year period ended 31 December 2001 referred to above have been restated.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Generally accepted accounting
  principles in the United Kingdom vary in certain significant respects from generally
  accepted accounting principles in the United States. Application of generally
  accepted accounting principles in the United States would have affected the
  Group's results of operations for each of the years in the three year period
  ended 31 December 2002 and the Group&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity as of
  31 December 2002 and 2001, to the extent summarised in note 42 to the consolidated
  financial statements.</font></p>
