<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities have been issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of April&nbsp;1, 1999 among the Issuer, the Indenture Guarantor and the Chase Manhattan Bank
as trustee (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Indenture</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in such Indenture and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Issuer and the Indenture Guarantor have requested that the Guarantor provide an additional guarantee of the Securities. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Guarantor, having benefited from the issuance of the Securities, is willing to provide such guarantee on the terms set forth in this Guarantee and has duly authorized the execution
and delivery of this Guarantee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as
follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Holders of the Securities and to the Trustee on behalf of each such Holder the due and punctual payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Securities and the due and punctual payment of the sinking fund or analogous payments referred to therein, if any, when and as the same shall become due and
payable (subject to any period of grace provided with respect thereto), whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, according to the terms thereof
and of the Indenture referred to therein. In the case of the failure of the Issuer punctually to make any such payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or any sinking fund or analogous
payment, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity or by declaration of
acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Issuer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Guarantor hereby further agrees that all payments of the principal of, interest and all other amounts due on the Securities in accordance with the Guarantee by the Guarantor will be

having the power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties is required by law. In that event, the Guarantor will pay to the Holder of any Security (subject to compliance by
such Holder or beneficial owner of the relevant Security with any relevant administrative requirements) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that every net payment on such Security,
after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, levy, impost or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the Taxing Jurisdiction or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Security to be then due and payable; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts will not apply if such Holder is liable for such taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges in
