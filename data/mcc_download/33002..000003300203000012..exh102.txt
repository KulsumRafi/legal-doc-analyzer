                        CARRIER AGREEMENT


Ennis  Business Forms, Inc. (Customer) and United Parcel Service,
Inc. (UPS) have entered into the following Agreement.

UPS  is  authorized to provide carrier service described  herein.
Customer  agrees  that  the terms of this Agreement  include  the
understanding  that the Agreement is based on the distinct  needs
of  the  Customer  and that UPS will be the Customer's  preferred
carrier of choice.  Accordingly;

1)   This  Agreement,  which incorporates  terms  and  conditions
     contained in the Guide to UPS Services and Tariff in  effect
     at  the  time  of  shipping, applies  to  eligible  packages
     tendered  by  the  Customer at all  U.S.  48  states  origin
     shipping  locations  as  listed on  Attachment  A  (Shipping
     Locations),  to  destinations listed in  the  Guide  to  UPS
     Services.   Shipping Locations may be added or deleted  from
     this Agreement only by mutual consent.

2)   Customer  agrees  to  provide UPS daily  with  the  shipping
     record  documentation as specified by UPS,  including  gross
     charges for packages shipped.  If Customer cannot supply UPS
     daily  with the gross package charges, charges will be based
     on  a  calculation  of total volume tendered  (less  service
     offerings   subject   to  incentive,   e.g.   Hundredweight)
     multiplied   by  Customer's  average  package   charge,   as
     determined by UPS.

3)   UPS  will provide the following services to Customer  during
     the life of this Agreement:

     Assistance of:
         (bullet)    Dedicated National Accounts Manager
         (bullet)    Dedicated Customer Service telephone contact
         (bullet)    Dedicated UPS National Account Executive(s)
         (bullet)    Business activity reports

4)   UPS  reserves the right to charge the Customer a minimum  of
     $50.00 per week in addition to any other charges due to UPS,
     if  the  Customer does not tender to UPS a minimum of  fifty
     packages per week.  This fee may not apply provided that the
     Customer  notifies  UPS of closings  due  to  vacations  and
     holidays.

5)   The  discount amounts below are contingent upon the  revenue
     tendered  to  UPS  by  the Customer and  upon  the  Customer
     maintaining its current shipping characteristics under  this
     Agreement.

  Securities and Exchange Commission.


<PAGE>
     Customer  further  agrees that discounts  do  not  apply  to
     Additional Charges which are defined as those additional and
     accessorial  charges set forth in the  UPS  Rate  Charts  in
     effect  at the time of shipping, which are subject to change
     at any time.

6)   With  respect to Commercial Ground packages, UPS  agrees  to
     grant  the  Customer discounts, per Attachment B,  from  the
     published UPS Commercial Ground Service Rate Chart in effect
     at  the time of shipping, less service offerings subject  to
     incentive,  e.g. Hundredweight.  The average weekly  revenue
     stated  will be inclusive of both commercial and residential
     revenue; however, the discount will only apply to commercial
     revenue.

7)   With  respect  to  UPS  Ground Hundredweight  packages,  UPS
     agrees to transport such shipments as Customer may tender to
     UPS   and  to  provide  Customer  such  transportation   and
     additional  services in accordance with  the  rules  of  UPS
     Hundredweight Service in effect at the time of shipping.

     UPS agrees to transport Ground packages tendered by Customer
     and   apply  UPS  Hundredweight  pricing  when  the   actual
     aggregate  weight  of all ground packages in  each  shipment
     delivered to one Consignee at one location on the  same  day
     from the same shipper is 200 pounds or more.

     UPS  agrees  to  grant the Customer the following  discounts
     from  the published UPS Hundredweight Service Rate Chart  in
     effect at the time of shipping: Tier 02 less #
                     for  shipments weighing less  than,  greater
     than, or equal to 500 pounds.  Customer further agrees  that
     no discount applies to Additional Charges.

     A  minimum  charge  for  a UPS Ground Hundredweight  Service
     shipment will be the greater of either a charge based on  15
     pounds  per package or the UPS Hundredweight published  rate
     minimum  for  applicable  tier in  effect  at  the  time  of
     shipping.

8)   With  respect  to  Air  packages, UPS agrees  to  grant  the
     Customer discounts, per Attachment B, from the UPS published
     Air Service Rates in effect at the time of shipping.

9)   With  respect to UPS Air Hundredweight packages, UPS  agrees
     to  transport such shipments as Customer may tender  to  UPS
     and  to  provide Customer such transportation and additional
     services  in  accordance with the rules of UPS Hundredweight
     Service in effect at the time of shipping.

     UPS  agrees  to  grant the Customer the following  discounts
     from  the published UPS Hundredweight Service Rate Chart  in
     effect at the time of shipping:

          UPS Next Day Air CWT:   #
          UPS 2nd Day Air CWT:    #

     UPS   will  apply  Hundredweight  pricing  when  the  actual
     aggregate  weight  of  all  air packages  in  each  shipment
     delivered to one Consignee at one location on the  same  day
     from the same shipper is 100 pounds or more.

<PAGE>
     A  minimum charge for a UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next  Day  Air
     Saver  or  UPS  2nd Day Air shipment will  be  based  on  an
     average  weight of 10 pounds per package.  The carrier  will
     compare  UPS Hundredweight Service air rates with  the  then
     effective  corresponding  single-package  air  rates.    The
     comparison  will be based on the average package  weight  in
     the shipment, and the lower rate will be charged.

     If  the  dimensional weight of a package measuring over  one
     cubic foot exceeds the actual weight, the dimensional weight
     of  that  package  will be used in the  calculation  of  the
     shipment billed weight.

10)  UPS  agrees to provide UPS SonicAir BestFlight which is same
     day,  rush  and  other  shipping  services  ("Services")  to
     Customer on an on-demand basis in accordance with the  terms
     and  conditions  of  the  UPS  SonicAir  Waybill,  including
     limitations  of  liability, all  of  which  is  incorporated
     herein by reference and this Agreement.  In the event  of  a
     conflict  between  this  Agreement  and  the  Waybill,   the
     Agreement will control.

     Services  will  be  available to Customer  twenty-four  (24)
     hours  a  day, seven (7) days a week, and will be  performed
     according  to the description contained in the UPS  SonicAir
     Waybill.

     UPS   SonicAir   agrees  to  grant  Customer  UPS   SonicAir
     BestFlight rates per Attachment C for domestic air shipments
     tendered  to  UPS  SonicAir  BestFlight.   Customer  further
     agrees  no  other discounts apply to UPS SonicAir BestFlight
     Rates or additional charges.

     UPS  will  calculate  the  transportation  charges  for  all
     locations once per week and will bill the Customer net after
     discount.

     Any  and  all  claims must be presented in  writing  to  UPS
     SonicAir  within  a reasonable time and in no  event  longer
     than  ninety (90) days after a shipment is tendered  to  UPS
     SonicAir.

11)  Customer agrees to comply with the letter weight restriction
     required  under the Private Express Statute in its UPS  Next
     Day  Air  Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., and UPS 2nd  Day  Air
     letters.

12)  The  rates,  terms and conditions of this Agreement  do  not
     apply to any shipper number used for drop shipping.

13)  UPS  and Customer agree that the rates, terms and conditions
     of this Agreement may not be extended or resold to any third
     party without prior written consent of UPS.

14)  UPS  will calculate the discount for all locations once  per
     week  and  will  bill the Customer net after discount.   The
     incentive  applied  each week will be calculated  using  the
     average  weekly revenue from the previous 13 weeks, once  13
     weeks have accumulated.

     detail  in  a form acceptable to UPS.  Package level  detail

     hereunder are not assignable or transferable.  Any attempted
     assignment  or  transfer hereof without  the  prior  written
     consent of UPS shall be void and without force or effect.

     after  thirty (30) days, any unresolved controversy or claim
     arising  out  of  or  relating to this contract,  or  breach
     thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the
     American  Arbitration  Association in  accordance  with  its
     Commercial  Arbitration Rules, and judgment upon  the  Award
     rendered  by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in  any  court
     having  jurisdiction thereof.  All mediation and arbitration
     shall be held in Atlanta, GA.

The incentives stated above apply to account numbers specified in

UPS Ground Commercial

     With  respect to Commercial Ground packages, UPS  agrees  to
     grant  the  Customer  a  discount  from  the  published  UPS
     Commercial Ground Service Rate Chart in effect at  the  time
     of  shipping,  less service offerings subject to  incentive,
     e.g. Hundredweight.  The average weekly revenue stated below
