interest is held by BLS if BLS retains sole voting and dispository control over
such shares and (ii) BLS and his immediate family shall not be deemed to
beneficially own any Stock in which any other Person has any economic or voting
interest other than a partnership, trust or corporation of which the entire
equity interest is held by BLS and his immediate family if BLS retains sole

this Agreement, the "immediate family" of BLS includes only the spouse and
children of BLS.

                 (ii)  to any Transfer of Stock by BLS or any BLS Investor to

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

         notwithstanding the terms of this Section 3.1, it shall not thereafter

         Transfer is made pro rata according to the economic interests of such
         partners therein as determined under the governing instruments of such
         partnership;

                 (vi)  to any Transfer of Stock for cash pursuant to the

         purchase Stock provided





                                      -11-
<PAGE>

         that upon any foreclosure such pledgee shall assume and be bound by
         all the terms of this Agreement;

                 (ix)  to any Transfer of Stock pursuant to a bona fide sale to
         a third party for cash, subject to the rights of first offer set forth
         in Section 4.1;

                 (x)  to any Transfer of Stock by a Tag-Along Stockholder
         pursuant to the tag-along rights set forth in Section 5.2, subject to
         the rights of first offer contained in Section 4.1;

                 (xi)  to any Transfer of Stock pursuant to the put-sale rights

         4.      Rights of First Offer.

                 4.1.  Transfers to Third Parties; Rights of First Offer.  (a)
Except as provided in Section 3.1, if at any time any Stockholder desires to
Transfer any Stock then owned by such Stockholder to any third party (including
upon foreclosure of or similar action with respect to any pledge), such
Stockholder shall first comply with the rights of first offer contained in this
Section 4.1.  Such Stockholder shall give written notice to the Company stating
that such Stockholder desires to make such Transfer, the number of shares of
Stock proposed to be Transferred and the cash price per share that such
Stockholder proposes to be paid for such shares of Stock or, in the case of a
Transfer in the form of a registered public offering, a range of





                                      -12-
<PAGE>

prices per share the low and high point of which shall not deviate by more than
15% from the midpoint of such range.

                 For purposes of this Agreement, any notice stating a
Stockholder's desire to Transfer Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.1 is
referred to as a "Seller's Notice"; the Common Stock covered by any Seller's
Notice is referred to as the "Offered Shares"; the Stockholder giving the
Seller's Notice is sometimes referred to as the "Seller"; the price per share
which the Stockholder proposes to be paid therefor (or, in the case of a
registered public offering, the midpoint of the range of prices proposed
therefor) is referred to as the "Offer Price"; and any notice given by the
Company or any Stockholder pursuant to which the Company or such Stockholder
(as the case may be) elects to purchase Offered Shares and that states (i) the
maximum number of such Offered Shares that the Company or such Stockholder (as
the case may be) elects to purchase, (ii) that the election made in such notice
is irrevocable and (iii) that the Company or such Stockholder (as the case may
be) shall purchase any number of Offered Shares up to such maximum number at
the Offer Price in cash is referred to as a "Buyer's Notice".  Each Seller's
Notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer by the Seller to the Company
and/or the other Stockholders, as the case may be, of the Offered Shares at the
Offer Price.  The Company shall mail a copy of any Seller's Notice (together
with a description of the offering procedures hereunder) to each Stockholder of
the Company within 5 days of the receipt thereof.





                                      -13-
<PAGE>

                 (b)  Offered Shares offered by any Seller pursuant to this
Section 4.1 shall be offered to the Company and other Stockholders in the
following order:

                 (i)  in the case of any offer by BLS, first to the Company and
         second to all other Stockholders who are not BLS Transferees;

                 (ii)  in the case of any offer by any BLS Investor or any
         other Transferee of BLS, first to BLS, second to the Company and third
         to the other Stockholders;

                 (iii)  in the case of any offer by any LBP Investors or any
         Transferee of any LBP Investors, first to the other LBP Investors,
         second to the Company and third to the other Stockholders; and

                 (iv)  in the case of any offer by any Loral Investor or any
         Transferee of Loral or a Loral Investor, first to the other Loral
         Investors, second to the Company and third to the other Stockholders.

The first Person or group to whom Offered Shares are so offered is called the
"First Offerees"; the second such Person or group is called the "Second
Offerees"; and the third such Person or group, if any, is called the "Third
Offerees".  Each such Person or group is called an "Offeree Group" and all such
Persons and groups are called the "Offerees".

                 (c)  Within 10 days after the date of mailing by the Company
of the Seller's Notice, the First Offerees may elect to purchase Offered Shares
at the Offer Price in a Buyer's Notice to the Seller, with a copy to the
Company.





                                      -14-
<PAGE>

                 (d)  If the First Offerees elect to purchase none of, or less
than all of, the Offered Shares, then the Company shall give written notice to
the Second Offerees not later than three days after the expiration of the
10-day period set forth in Section 4.1(c), which notice shall specify the Offer
Price and the number of remaining Offered Shares available for purchase by the
Second Offerees.  The Second Offerees may elect to purchase Offered Shares at
the Offer Price in a Buyer's Notice to the Seller, with a copy to the Company,
within 10 days following mailing of the notice from the Company.

                 (e)  If the First Offerees and the Second Offerees elect to
purchase none of, or less than all of, the Offered Shares, then the Company
shall give written notice to the Third Offerees (if applicable) not later than
three days after the expiration of the 10-day period set forth in Section
4.1(d), which notice shall specify the Offer Price and the number of remaining
Offered Shares available for purchase by the Third Offerees.  The Third
Offerees may elect to purchase Offered Shares at the Offer Price in a Buyer's
Notice to the Seller, with a copy to the Company, within 10 days following
mailing of the notice from the Company.

                 (f)  If the Offerees fail to elect to purchase all the Offered
Shares, then the Company shall give written notice to the First Offerees, the
Second Offerees and, if applicable, the Third Offerees not later than three
days after the expiration of the last 10-day period set forth in Section 4.1(d)
or (if applicable) Section 4.1(e), which notice shall specify the Offer Price
and





                                      -15-
<PAGE>

the number of remaining Offered Shares available for purchase by the Offerees.
Offerees may elect to purchase Offered Shares at the Offer Price in a Buyer's
Notice to the Seller, with a copy to the Company, within 10 days following
mailing of the notice from the Company.

                 (g)  If the Offerees fail to elect to purchase all the Offered
Shares within the time periods specified in this Section 4.1, then the Seller
(i) shall be under no obligation to sell any of the Offered Shares to the
Company or any Stockholder, unless the Seller so elects, and (ii) may, within a
period of three months from the date of the Seller's Notice, sell all or any
Offered Shares to one or more third parties for cash at a price per share not
less than the Offer Price and on other terms which are no more favorable to the
purchaser than those set forth in the Seller's Notice.

                 (h)  In the event of an oversubscription to purchase Offered
Shares in connection with notice given under Sections 4.1(c), (d), (e) or (f)
hereof, each Offeree which delivered a Buyer's Notice thereunder shall be
permitted to purchase its pro rata share of the Offered Shares.  Such pro rata
share shall equal the product of (i) the fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the number of Offered Shares such Offeree offered to purchase pursuant to
its Buyer's Notice delivered under Section 4.1(c), (d), (e) or (f), as
applicable, and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of
Offered Shares all Offerees offered to purchase under Section 4.1(c), (d), (e)
or (f), as applicable, times (ii) the aggregate number of Offered





                                      -16-
<PAGE>

Shares available to be purchased under Section 4.1(c), (d), (e) or (f), as
applicable.

                 4.2.  Subsequent Transfers.  If the Company and the
Stockholders do not elect to purchase all the Offered Shares at the Offer Price
in cash and the Seller shall not have Transferred the Offered Shares to any
Transferee prior to the expiration of the three month period specified in
Section 4.1(g), then the rights of first offer under this Article 4 shall again
apply in connection with any subsequent Transfer or offer to Transfer by such
Seller.

         5.      Public Offering; Tag-Along Rights.

                 5.1.  Registration Rights.

                 The Company hereby grants to each Stockholder the
registration and other rights set forth in, and each Stockholder agrees to
comply with the terms and conditions contained in, Exhibit C hereto.

                 5.2.  Tag-Along Right.  (a)  If, at any time, any Stockholder
(or group of Stockholders acting in concert) (individually, the "Original
Selling Stockholder") proposes to Transfer shares of Common Stock (or options
or rights to acquire Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock)
representing more than 15% of the Common Equivalents to any Person or group of
Persons (the "Proposed Purchaser") in any transaction or series of related
transactions (other than (i) sales pursuant to a bona fide public offering
under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and (ii)
Transfers permitted under Section 3.1 (other than clause





                                      -17-
<PAGE>

(ix) thereof)), the Original Selling Stockholder shall afford each other
Stockholder (each, a "Tag-Along Stockholder") the opportunity to participate
proportionately in such Transfer in accordance with this Section 5.2.  Each
Stockholder shall have the right to Transfer the same percentage of the Common
Equivalents owned by such Stockholder as the percentage of Common Equivalents
the Original Selling Stockholder is proposing to transfer of such Original
Selling Stockholder's Common Equivalents.  The Original Selling Stockholder
shall give notice to the other Stockholders of their right to sell Common
Equivalents hereunder (the "Tag-Along Notice") which notice shall state the
number of shares of Common Equivalents proposed to be Transferred, the proposed
offering price and any other material terms and conditions of the Transfer.

                 (b)  Within 10 days after the date of delivery of a Tag-Along
Notice, any Stockholder may elect to participate in such Transfer pursuant to
the terms and conditions of such Notice in a notice given to the Original
Selling Stockholder; provided, however, that the only representations and
warranties which such Tag-Along Stockholder shall be required to give are as to
due authority and execution, good title and the absence of liens with respect
to such Tag-Along Stockholder's Common Equivalents and the only indemnities
which such Tag-Along Stockholder may be required to give are as to the
foregoing matters.

                 (c)  If the Proposed Purchaser is acquiring Common Equivalents
in a single transaction from more than one Stockholder or in a series of
related transactions from one or





                                      -18-
<PAGE>

more Stockholders, (i) the price per share or Common Equivalent shall be the
highest of the prices, and the other terms and conditions of the Transfer shall
be the most favorable of the terms and conditions, offered by the Proposed
Purchaser to any Stockholder at or prior to the consummation of such Transfer
and (ii) the form of consideration shall be the same for all Common Equivalents
Transferred in such Transfer.

                 (d)  Any Tag-Along Stockholder exercising Tag-Along rights
hereunder with respect to any Common Equivalent other than shares of Common
Stock shall convert or exercise such Common Equivalent into or for Common Stock
prior to the consummation of any Transfer hereunder.

                 (e)  Any Original Selling Stockholder that proposes to
Transfer shares of Common Stock under this Section 5 shall comply with the
Rights of First Offer provisions set forth in Section 4 hereto.  The Seller's
Notice required thereunder shall be given by the Original Selling Stockholder
concurrently with the Tag-Along Notice hereunder and any purchase thereunder
and hereunder shall occur simultaneously.

                 (f)  Any Transfer by the Original Selling Stockholder subject
to this Section 5.2 shall be made within three months of the date of the
Tag-Along Notice and shall be made substantially in accordance with the terms
and conditions described in such Tag-Along Notice.  If the Original Selling
Stockholder shall not have effected the Transfer prior to the expiration of
such three-month period, the tag-along rights under this Section 5.2





                                      -19-
<PAGE>

shall again apply in connection with any subsequent Transfer or offer to
Transfer by such Original Selling Stockholder.

         6.      Put-Sale Option.

                 6.1.  Appraisal.  (a)  At any time and from time to time,
either LBP or BLS may, by notice (an "Appraisal Request") to the Company and
the other party, request an appraisal of the value of the common equity of the
Company (the "Appraised Value").  BLS, LBP and the Company shall cause such
appraisal to be completed within 30 days of delivery of the Appraisal Request
according to the procedures set forth in Section 6.1(b) and (c).

                 (b)  The Appraised Value shall be determined jointly by LBP
and a nationally recognized investment bank selected by BLS (the "First
Investment Bank") or, if LBP and the First Investment Bank fail to agree on an
Appraised Value within 15 days of delivery of the Appraisal Request, by another
nationally recognized investment bank selected jointly by LBP and BLS (the
"Alternative Investment Bank").  Any Appraised Value as determined by any
Alternative Investment Bank shall be between the values determined by LBP and
the First Investment Bank.

                 (c)  The Appraised Value shall be the value of the Company's
common equity (assuming conversion of all Common Equivalents to Common Stock)
that would be realized in a sale of the Company as an entirety with a
reasonable amount of time available to negotiate and consummate such sale;
provided that the Appraised Value shall not be less than the value offered in
any bona fide proposal that may be made to acquire the Company or





                                      -20-
<PAGE>

its assets prior to the date upon which the Appraised Value shall be
determined.

                 (d)  The Company shall give LBP, the First Investment Bank and
any Alternative Investment Bank access to the books, records and personnel of
the Company and shall pay all fees and expenses of the appraisers incurred in
connection with the Appraisal.

                 6.2.  Put-Sale Right.  (a)  Within 15 days after the
Appraised Value has been established, either BLS or LBP (the "Put Party") may,
at its sole option, deliver written notice (the "Put-Sale Notice") to the other
party (the "Other Party") and the Company of its desire to sell all of the
Common Stock owned by the Put Party and any Transferees thereof designated by
the Put Party (the "Put-Sale Group") from among the Put Party and their
Transferees.  The purchase price for the shares of Stock shall be an amount
equal to the pro rata share (based on Common Equivalents) of the Appraised
Value of the Common Stock subject to such put.

                 (b)  The Other Party shall have 90 days following receipt of
the Put-Sale Notice to make binding arrangements (including full financing
commitments) for the purchase for cash of the Stock of the Put-Sale Group by
the Other Party or a third party designated by the Other Party.  The closing of
such purchase shall be no later than 30 days following the execution of such
binding arrangements, subject to extension with the written consent of the Put
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  During such 90-day
period, the Other





                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Party shall either (i) use its best efforts to arrange for the prompt purchase
of the Stock or (ii) notify the Put Party as soon as the Other Party determines
that it will not or can not purchase, nor arrange for a third party to
purchase, the Stock held by the Put-Sale Group.

                 (c)  In the event that the Other Party is unable or chooses
not to arrange for and consummate the purchase of the Put-Sale Group's Stock
within the time periods set forth in Section 6.1(b), then BLS and LBP shall
cause the Company to be sold as an entirety if such sale can be arranged
yielding proceeds at least equal to the Appraised Value.  BLS, LBP and the
Company shall proceed in good faith and use their best efforts to sell the
Company as an entirety as promptly as practicable and in any event within six
months of the expiration of the time periods set forth in Section 6.1(b),
subject to extension with the written consent of BLS and LBP, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.  If it becomes apparent, in the Put Party's
reasonable judgment, that the Company can not be sold at the Appraised Value,
then the Put Party, at its sole option, may reduce the price for which the
Company is being offered by up to 10% of the Appraised Value.  Any sale of the
Company as an entirety hereunder shall include all Stockholders and the
proceeds thereof shall be allocated among the Stockholders in accordance with
their Stock ownership in the Company based on Common Equivalents.

         7.      Closing.

                 7.1.  Closing.  Any selling Stockholder and any Stockholders
who are purchasing or selling any shares of Stock pursuant to Articles 4, 5 or
6 shall mutually determine a closing date (the "Closing Date") which, subject
to any applicable regulatory waiting periods, shall not be more than 30 days
after the last notice is given with respect to such purchase or after the
expiration of the last notice period applicable to such purchase.  The closing
shall be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date at the principal
office of the Company, or at such other time or place as the parties mutually
agree.

                 7.2.  Deliveries at Closing; Method of Payment of Purchase
Price.  On the Closing Date, any selling Stockholder shall deliver (1)
certificates representing the shares of Stock being sold, free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance, (2) any documents representing options, rights or
convertible securities being sold, and (3) such other documents, including
evidence of ownership and authority, as the purchasers may reasonably request.
The purchase price shall be paid by delivery of a cashier's or certified check.

         8.      Preemptive Rights.

                 (a)  In the case of the proposed issuance of, or the proposed
granting by the Company of warrants, options or other rights to purchase,
shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of Common Stock (other than in a transaction specified in Section 8(b))
or participating preferred stock, if any, each Stockholder shall





                                      -23-
<PAGE>

have the right, on the same terms as those of the proposal and during a
reasonable time no less than 30 days after the Company has given notice to the
Stockholders of such proposed issuance or granting, to purchase a proportion of
such shares of capital stock or securities, warrants, options or rights equal
to such Stockholder's percentage ownership of the then outstanding Common
Equivalents on a record date not more than 10 days prior to such issuance or
granting.  The price or prices for such shares of capital stock, securities,
warrants, options or rights shall not be less favorable to the purchasing

<PAGE>

BLS Nominees constituting all of the Board of Directors not otherwise

constituting at least a majority of such Board) for as long as BLS and his
immediate family beneficially own at least 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock;
three Nominees for as long as BLS and his immediate family beneficially own at
least 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and one BLS Nominee for as long as BLS
and his immediate family beneficially own any outstanding shares of Common
Stock.  LBP shall be entitled, but not required, to designate members (the "LBP
Nominees") of the Board of Directors constituting all of the Board of Directors
not otherwise designated by BLS as provided in this Section 10.1 (such LBP
Nominees constituting at least a majority of such Board) for so long as (i) LBP
and its Affiliates beneficially own at least 1,350,000 shares of Common
Equivalents and (ii) either (A) BLS and his immediate family beneficially own
less than 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock or (B) BLS shall have died or become
incapable of acting as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company for
180 consecutive days due to physical or mental illness; three LBP Nominees for
so long as LBP and Affiliates beneficially own at least 1,000,000 shares of
Common Equivalents; and one LBP Nominee for so long as LBP and its Affiliates
beneficially own any outstanding shares of Common Stock.  If and for so long as
Loral and its Affiliates own any shares of Voting Common Stock, at the request
of Loral, the number of members on the Board of Directors shall be increased to
9, Loral shall be entitled to designate one member (the "Loral Nominee") of the





                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Board of Directors and the remaining member of the Board of Directors shall be
designated by the Stockholder which at such time has the right hereunder to
designate a majority of the Board of Directors.  Each of the Stockholders
agrees to vote its shares of Common Stock, at any regular or special meeting of
the stockholders of the Company called for the purpose of filling positions on
the Board of Directors, or in any written consent executed in lieu of such a
meeting of stockholders, and agrees to take all actions necessary, to ensure
the election to the Board of Directors of the LBP Nominees, BLS Nominees and
Loral Nominee as described herein.

                 (b)  The Company and each Stockholder hereby agrees to use its
best efforts to call, or cause the appropriate officers and directors of the
Company to call, a special meeting of stockholders of the Company and to vote
all of the shares of Common Stock owned or held of record by such Stockholder
for, or to take all actions by written consent in lieu of any such meeting
necessary to cause, the removal (with or without cause) of any LBP Nominee if
LBP (or any Affiliate thereof designated by LBP) requests such director's
removal for any reason, any BLS Nominee if BLS requests such director's removal
for any reason or any Loral Nominee if Loral requests such director's removal
for any reason.  LBP and its Affiliates, BLS and Loral shall have the right to
designate a new nominee in the event any LBP Nominee, BLS Nominee or Loral
Nominee, as applicable, shall be so removed or vacate his directorship for any
reason.  The number of Directors that shall constitute the entire Board of
Directors may





                                      -27-
<PAGE>

be increased or decreased from time to time in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the by-laws.

                 (c)  Subject to Section 10.1(b) hereof, each Stockholder
hereby agrees that, at any time it is then entitled to vote for the election or
removal of directors, it will not vote in favor of the removal of any LBP
Nominee, BLS Nominee or Loral Nominee unless such removal shall be for Cause
otherwise than as required by Section 10.1(b) hereof.  For the purposes of this
Section 10.1(c), "Cause" shall mean the willful and continued failure by a
director substantially to perform duties as a director of the Company, the
willful engaging by a director in conduct which is demonstrably and materially
injurious to the Company, or the director's conviction of any crime
constituting a felony.

                 (d)  The Company covenants that it will not, without the
consent of LBP, take any action requiring (under the Company's by-laws) the
approval of at least one LBP Nominee if the only LBP Nominees approving such
action are Persons whose removal from the Board of Directors LBP has requested
at or prior to the time of such action.

                 (e)  The initial LBP Nominees shall be James Stern, Robert
Towbin and Alan Washkowitz.  LBP and Loral each acknowledges and agrees that it
will consult BLS with respect to any future LBP Nominees or Loral Nominees,
respectively, designated to replace the initial LBP Nominees or Loral Nominees,
respectively, with a view towards ensuring a harmonious Board of Directors.

                 10.2.  Chairman of the Board.  In the event that BLS shall
have died or become incapable of acting as chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Company for 180 consecutive days due to physical or mental illness, the
successor chairman of the Board shall be selected by LBP from among the LBP
Nominees.  Upon such death or disability of BLS, the estate of BLS may, but
shall not be required to, designate a member of the Board of Directors, other
than the Chairman of the Board to replace BLS.

                 10.3.  Charter and By-laws.  (a)  Exhibits A and B set forth
copies of the Company's Charter and by-laws, each in the form in effect on the
date hereof (the "Charter Documents").

                 (b)  The Company covenants that it will act in accordance with
the Charter Documents and will not (subject to Section 10.1(d)), without the
approval of an LBP Nominee, so long as LBP shall beneficially own 1,000,000 or
more shares of Common Stock, then in office, amend either of the Charter
Documents.  Each Stockholder shall vote its Common Stock at any regular or
special meeting of stockholders of the Company or in any written consent
executed in lieu of such a meeting of stockholders, and shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Charter Documents do not, at any time, conflict
with the provisions of this Agreement and (unless otherwise specified by LBP)
to ensure that the Charter Documents continue to provide as specified in
Exhibits A or B, as applicable.

                 10.4.  Certain Stock-Related Compensation Plans.  Each of the
Stockholders (other than Loral) agrees to vote all of the shares of Common
Stock entitled to vote owned or held of record





                                      -29-
<PAGE>

by such stockholder to approve any and all Stock related employee compensation
plan of the Company provided such plan has been approved by the Board of
Directors.

                 10.5.  Purchase of Debt Securities.  If, at any time prior to
the first anniversary of the Effective Date, BLS or LBP shall purchase any
Senior Secured Notes, Senior Subordinated Debentures or Senior Bank Financing,
such party shall deliver a written notice to Loral offering to sell to Loral an
amount of the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Subordinated Debentures or Senior
Bank Financing so purchased equal to the face amount of the securities so
purchased multiplied by the percentage of the Common Equivalents then owned by
Loral.  Such offer shall be on the same terms and conditions (including price
and payment terms) as were applicable to the purchase by BLS or LBP.  Loral
shall have a period of 10-days to accept such offer by delivering a written
notice to BLS or LBP, as applicable, and if no such notice is delivered in a
timely fashion such offer shall expire.

                 10.6.  Company Purchase of Stock.  If, at any time prior to
the first anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company shall purchase (an
"Original Repurchase") any Stock from a BLS Investor, LBP Investor or Loral
Investor (each, an "Investor Group"), the Company shall, upon the consummation
of the Original Repurchase, deliver a written notice to each Investor Group
which did not sell Stock in the Original Repurchase, offering to purchase the
same percentage of the Stock owned by the members of such Investor Group as the
percentage of the position of the Investor Group participating in the Original
Repurchase that was





                                      -30-
<PAGE>

purchased from the Investor Group which participated in the Original
Repurchase.  Each such offer shall be on the same terms as the Original
Repurchase.  Each Investor Group shall have a period of 10 days to accept such
offer by delivering a written notice to the Company and if no such notice is
delivered in a timely fashion such offer shall expire.

                 11.    No Implied Right to Employment.  Neither this
Agreement nor any provision hereof nor any action taken or omitted to be taken
hereunder shall be deemed to create or confer on any Stockholder who is an
employee of the Company or any Affiliate any right to be retained in the employ
of the Company or any Affiliate thereof, or to interfere with or limit in any
way the right of the Company or any Affiliate thereof to terminate the
employment of such Stockholder at any time.

         12.     Termination.

                 12.1.  Termination.  (a)  This Agreement shall terminate
after a public offering as a result of which more than 75% of the then
outstanding shares of Common Equivalents, after giving effect to such offering,
have been sold to the public pursuant to one or more effective registration
statements under the Securities Act or are otherwise owned by Persons other
than Stockholders; provided that the registration rights contained in Exhibit C
hereto shall continue with respect to any remaining shares of Common Stock held
by the Stockholders for so long as they hold such shares.

                 (b)  The provisions contained in Article 10 shall terminate on
the tenth anniversary of the date hereof.





                                      -31-

         13.     Miscellaneous.

                 13.1.  Recapitalization, Exchanges, etc., Affecting the
Common Stock.  The provisions of this Agreement shall (a) apply to the full
extent set forth herein with respect to the shares of Stock and (b) as
appropriate with respect to any and all shares of capital stock of the Company
or any successor or assign of the Company (whether by merger, consolidation,
sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in exchange
for, or in substitution for the shares of Stock, by reason of any stock
dividend, split, reverse split, combination, recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise.  In the event of any
change in capitalization of the Company, as a result of any stock split, stock
dividend or stock combination, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

                 13.2.  Injunctive Relief.  It is hereby agreed and
acknowledged that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that
would be suffered if the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations
herein imposed on them and that in the event of such failure, an aggrieved
person will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law.
Any such person shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief, including
specific performance to enforce such obligation, without the posting of any
bond, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

respective successors and assigns; provided that (i) except as expressly
provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder
may be transferred by the Company and (ii) no rights of any Stockholder under
this Agreement may be assigned except that any Stockholder may transfer its
rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to a Transferee in
connection with a Transfer of Stock made in compliance with all of the
provisions of this Agreement to a Person who is or thereby becomes a
Stockholder.  If any Stockholder shall acquire additional Stock, such Stock
shall, except as expressly provided herein, be held subject to all of the terms
of this Agreement.

                 13.4.  Amendment; Waiver.  This Agreement may be amended (i)
by a written instrument signed by the Company and by Stockholders holding an
aggregate of at least 80% of the Common Equivalents held by the Stockholders
and, in the case of any provision of any amendment that adversely affects any
Stockholder or all of the members of any group of Stockholders differently from
any of the other Stockholders, the written consent of such Stockholder or
members of such group of Stockholders holding an aggregate of at least 75% of
the Common Equivalents held by such group of Stockholders, respectively, or

BLS and his immediate family beneficially own at least 1,350,000 Common
Equivalents, (y) LBP and its Affiliates beneficially own
