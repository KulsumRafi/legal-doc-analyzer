</DIR>

<P>2.&#9;<U>Place of Employment</P>
</U><P>The place of employment shall be the Company's headquarters building in Bridgeport, West Virginia unless the Employee and the Company agree to an alternative location.</P>

<P>b.&#9;<U>Responsibilities.</U>  The Employee shall have obligations, duties, authority and power to do such acts as are customarily done by a person holding the same or an equivalent position in corporations of similar size to the Company.

Employee shall not be employed in any other business activity during the Term, whether or not such activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage, provided, however, that this restriction shall not be construed as preventing Employee from investing his or her personal assets in a business which does not compete with the Company or its Affiliates, where the form or manner of such investment will not require services of any significance on the part of Employee in the operation of the affairs of the business in which such investment is made and in which his participation is solely that of a passive investor or advisor.</P>
<P>d.&#9;<U>Adherence to Standards.</U>  Employee shall comply with the written policies, standards, rules and regulations of the Company from time to time established for all executive officers of the Company consistent with Employee's position and level of authority.</P></DIR>

A portion of the bonus up to a maximum amount equal to 75% of the Base Salary shall be based on objective criteria to be determined prior to the beginning of each calendar year in writing by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, but only after consultation with the Employee.  Performance criteria used in the determination of the objective part of the Bonus amount may include net income, cash flow, EBITDA, production, reserves, or such other criteria as the Compensation Committee may determine to be critical to the performance of the Employee and the Company.  The Bonus may also include an amount up to 25% of the Base salary to be determined at the sole discretion of the compensation committee at the end of the calendar year based on such criteria as they deem to be important to the performance of the Employee. The total Bonus for a given year shall not exceed 100% of the aggregate Base Salary for such year.  The Bonus shall be paid in cash no later than April 30 of the following year, except that up to 50% may be payable in Company stock in the Employee's tax-deferred account at the option of the Employee and in accordance with the terms of any applicable deferred compensation plan, provided approval of such deferral by the shareholders of the Company has been obtained if required by applicable rules and regulations.</P>
<P>c.&#9;<U>Retirement Compensation.</U>  For each year worked under this Agreement the Employee shall earn and be entitled to receive an annual retirement payment equal to $500 times the total number of years the employee is employed by the Company (the &quot;Retirement Payment&quot;).

Information subject to the provisions of this paragraph shall include, without limitation:</P><DIR>

<P>vi.&#9;Any other information or contacts relating to the Company's drilling, development, fund-raising, purchasing, engineering, marketing, merchandising, and selling activities.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>b.&#9;<U>Return of Confidential Material.</U>  All maps, logs, data, drawings and other records and written material prepared or compiled by the Employee or furnished to the Employee during the Term shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company and none of such material shall be retained by the Employee upon termination of his employment.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "person" shall include natural persons, corporations, business trusts, associations, sole proprietorships, unincorporated organizations, partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships, and governments, or any agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof.</P>

Employee acknowledges that the granting of a temporary injunction, a temporary restraining order or other permanent injunction merely prohibiting Employee from engaging in any Business Activities would not be an adequate remedy upon breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, and consequently agrees upon any such breach or threatened breach to the granting of injunctive relief prohibiting Employee from engaging in any activities prohibited by this Agreement.  No remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given hereunder now or hereinafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7.&#9;<U>Termination of the Agreement</P><DIR>
<DIR>

"Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate the specified termination provision in this Agreement relied upon (Section 7.c., Section 7.d., Section 7.e., or Section 7.f.) and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Employee's employment under the provision so indicated; provided, however, no such purported termination shall be effective without such Notice of Termination; provided further, however, any purported termination by the Company or by Employee shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with  Section 8 (&quot;Notices&quot;) of this Agreement. </P>

</DIR>

<P>No act, or failure to act, on the Employee's part shall be grounds for termination with Just Cause unless he has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith or without a reasonable belief that his action or failure to act was in or at least not opposed to the best interests of the Company.  The Employee shall not be deemed to have been terminated with Just Cause unless there shall have been delivered to the Employee a letter setting forth the reasons for the Company's termination of the Employee for Just Cause and the Employee has failed to cure such reason for termination within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice.</P></DIR>
