         As of the Effective Date, the Certificates evidencing the Extinguished
Securities shall evidence solely the right to receive from Viasystems or Group
the distribution of the consideration, if any, set forth in Article III.C. On
the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided for herein, (i) the
Extinguished Securities, to the extent not already cancelled, shall be deemed
cancelled and of no further force or effect without any further action on the
part of the Bankruptcy Court or any other Person and (ii) the obligations


                                       18
<PAGE>


of the Debtors under the Extinguished Securities and under the Debtors'
certificate of incorporation, any agreements, indentures, or certificates of
designations governing the Extinguished Securities shall be terminated and
discharged; provided, however, that each indenture or other agreement that
governs the rights of the holder of a Claim based on the Extinguished Securities
and that is administered by an indenture trustee, agent, or servicer shall
continue in effect solely for the purposes of (a) allowing such indenture
trustee, agent, or servicer to make the distributions to be made on account of
such Claims hereunder and (b) permitting such indenture trustee, agent, or
servicer to maintain any rights it may have for fees, costs, and expenses under
such indenture or other agreement. Additionally, the cancellation of any
indenture shall not impair the rights and duties under such indenture as between
the indenture trustee thereunder and the beneficiaries of the trust created
thereby. Additionally, as of the Effective Date, all Equity Interests other than
the Equity Interests in Viasystems, to the extent not already cancelled, shall
be cancelled.

         Any actions taken by an indenture trustee, agent or servicer that are
not for the purposes authorized hereunder shall not be binding upon the Debtors.
Except with respect to the making of distributions as provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Reorganized Debtors may, with or without cause, terminate any
indenture or other governing agreement and the authority of any indenture
trustee, agent or servicer to act thereunder at any time by giving five Business
Days' written notice of termination to the indenture trustee, agent, or
servicer. If distributions hereunder on account of Subordinated Note Claims have
not been completed at the time of termination of the indenture or other
governing agreement, the Reorganized Debtors shall designate a distribution
agent to act in place of the indenture trustee, agent, or servicer, and the
provisions of this Plan shall be deemed to apply to the new distribution agent.

each Debtor that is not property of its Estate and that is not specifically
disposed of pursuant to this Plan, shall revest in the applicable Reorganized
Debtor on the Effective Date. Thereafter, the Reorganized Debtors may operate
their businesses and may use, acquire, and dispose of property free of any
restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the Bankruptcy
Court. As of the Effective Date, all property of the Reorganized Debtors shall
be free and clear of all Claims, encumbrances, Equity Interests, charges and
liens except as specifically provided or contemplated herein or the Confirmation
Order. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Reorganized Debtors
may, without application to or approval by the Bankruptcy Court, pay
professional fees and expenses incurred after the Effective Date.

J.       PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS OF ACTION; SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION CLAIMS

         Except as otherwise provided herein or the Confirmation Order, or in
any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement entered into in
connection with this Plan, in accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code, the Reorganized Debtors shall retain and may enforce, sue on, settle, or
compromise (or decline to do any of the foregoing) all claims, rights or causes
of action, suits, and proceedings, whether in law or in equity, whether known or
unknown, that the Debtors or their Estates may hold against any Person or entity
without the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The Reorganized


                                       21
<PAGE>


Debtors or their successor(s) may pursue such retained claims, rights or causes
of action, suits, or proceedings as appropriate, in accordance with the best
interests of the Reorganized Debtors or their successor(s) who hold such rights.

K.       EFFECTUATING DOCUMENTS; FURTHER TRANSACTIONS

         The chairman of the board of directors, president, chief financial
officer, any executive vice-president or senior vice-president, or any other
appropriate officer of each Debtor shall be authorized to execute, deliver,
file, or record such contracts, instruments, releases, indentures, and other
agreements or documents, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or
appropriate, to effectuate and further evidence the terms and conditions of this
Plan. The secretary or assistant secretary of the appropriate Debtor shall be
authorized to certify or attest to any of the foregoing actions.

L.       EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN TRANSFER TAXES

         Pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, any transfers from
a Debtor to a Reorganized Debtor or any other Person or entity pursuant to this
Plan shall not be subject to any document recording tax, stamp tax, conveyance
fee, intangibles or similar tax, mortgage tax, real estate transfer tax,
mortgage recording tax, or other similar tax or governmental assessment, and the
Confirmation Order shall direct the appropriate state or local governmental
officials or agents to forego the collection of any such tax or governmental
assessment and to accept for filing and recordation any of the foregoing
instruments or other documents without the payment of any such tax or
governmental assessment.

M.       SUBROGATION

         Other than in respect of any Existing Credit Agreement Claims, the
Reorganized Debtors shall maintain and be entitled to assert any right of
subrogation the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors may have under applicable
non-bankruptcy law arising on account or in respect of any distribution to a
holder of Claim under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reorganized
Debtors shall be deemed to waive and shall have no right of subrogation in
respect of any Existing Credit Agreement Claim.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                       PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS

A.       DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS ALLOWED AS OF THE
         EFFECTIVE DATE

         Except as otherwise provided herein or as ordered by the Bankruptcy
Court, distributions and issuances of New Securities to be made in exchange for
or on account of Claims or Equity Interests that are Allowed Claims or Allowed
Equity Interests as of the Effective Date shall be made on the Distribution
Date, or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. All Cash distributions
shall be made by the Disbursing Agent from available Cash of the Reorganized
Debtors. Any distribution hereunder of property other than Cash (including any
issuance of New Securities and the distribution of such New Securities in
exchange for Allowed Claims as of the Effective Date) shall be made by the
Disbursing Agent, the indenture trustee or the transfer agent in accordance with
the terms of this Plan.


                                       22
<PAGE>


B.       DISBURSING AGENT

         The Disbursing Agent shall make all distributions required hereunder,
except with respect to a holder of a Claim whose distribution is governed by an
indenture or other agreement and is administered by an indenture trustee, agent,
or servicer, which distributions shall be deposited with the appropriate
indenture trustee, agent, or servicer, who shall deliver such distributions to
the holders of Claims in accordance with the provisions hereof and the terms of
the relevant indenture or other governing agreement.

         If the Disbursing Agent is an independent third party designated by the
Reorganized Debtors to serve in such capacity (or, in the case of an indenture
or other agreement that governs distributions and is administered by an
indenture trustee, agent, or servicer), such Disbursing Agent, indenture
trustee, agent, or servicer shall receive, without further Bankruptcy Court
approval, reasonable compensation for distribution services rendered pursuant to
this Plan and reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with such services from the Reorganized Debtors on terms acceptable
to the Reorganized Debtors. No Disbursing Agent shall be required to give any
bond or surety or other security for the performance of its duties unless
otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. If otherwise so ordered, all costs
and expenses of procuring any such bond shall be paid by the Reorganized
Debtors.

C.       SURRENDER OF SECURITIES OR INSTRUMENTS

         On or before the Distribution Date, or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, each holder of a Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate to the Disbursing Agent, or, with respect to the Subordinated Notes,
the indenture trustee, and such Certificate shall be cancelled. No distribution
of property hereunder, including the sale of New Senior Convertible Preferred
Stock to a holder of a Subordinated Note Claim pursuant to the Rights Offering,
shall be made to or on behalf of any such holder unless and until such
Certificate is received by the Disbursing Agent or the indenture trustee, as the
case may be, or the unavailability of such Certificate is reasonably established
to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent or indenture trustee, as the case
may be. Any such holder who fails to surrender or cause to be surrendered such
Certificate or fails to execute and deliver an affidavit of loss and indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to the Disbursing Agent or indenture trustee, as the
case may be, prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date shall be
deemed to have forfeited all rights and Claims or Equity Interests in respect of
such Certificate, shall not participate in any distribution hereunder and shall
have no right to participate in the Rights Offering, and (i) all Cash in respect
of such forfeited distribution, including interest accrued thereon, shall revert
to Reorganized Group and (ii) all New Securities in respect of such forfeited
distribution shall be cancelled notwithstanding any federal or escheat laws to
the contrary.

D.       INSTRUCTIONS TO DISBURSING AGENT

         Prior to any distribution on account of a Subordinated Note Claim, the
indenture trustee shall (i) inform the Disbursing Agent as to the amount of
properly surrendered Subordinated Notes and (ii) inform the Disbursing Agent in
a properly completed letter of transmittal, accompanied by properly remitted
securities, of the names of holders of Allowed Subordinated Note Claims, and the
number of shares of New Stock to be issued and distributed to or on behalf of
such holders of Allowed Subordinated Note Claims in exchange for properly
surrendered Subordinated Notes.

E.       SERVICES OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE

         The indenture trustee's services with respect to consummation of this
Plan shall be as set forth herein and as authorized by the indenture.


                                       23
<PAGE>


F.       RECORD DATE FOR DISTRIBUTIONS

         At the close of business on the Distribution Record Date, the transfer
ledgers for the Existing Bank Debt (maintained by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as
Administrative Agent under the Existing Credit Agreement), Senior Notes,
Subordinated Notes, and Existing Group Stock shall be closed, and there shall be
no further changes in the record holders of such debt and securities. The
Reorganized Debtors and the Disbursing Agent, if any, shall have no obligation
to recognize any transfer of any such debt and securities occurring after the
Distribution Record Date and shall be entitled instead to recognize and deal for
all purposes hereunder with only those record holders listed on the transfer
ledgers as of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date.

G.       MEANS OF CASH PAYMENT

         Cash payments hereunder shall be in U.S. funds by check, wire transfer,
or such other commercially reasonable manner as the payor shall determine in its
sole discretion.

H.       CALCULATION OF DISTRIBUTION AMOUNTS OF NEW STOCK AND NEW WARRANTS

         No fractional shares of New Stock or New Warrants to purchase
fractional shares of New Stock shall be issued or distributed hereunder or by
Reorganized Group or any Disbursing Agent, indenture trustee, agent, or
servicer. Each Person entitled to receive New Stock or New Warrants to purchase
shares of New Stock shall receive the total number of whole shares of New Stock
or New Warrants to purchase the total number of whole shares of New Stock to
which such Person is entitled. Whenever any distribution to a particular Person
would otherwise call for distribution of a fraction of a share of New Stock or a
New Warrant to purchase a fractional share of New Stock, such number of shares
or New Warrants to purchase shares to be distributed shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number.

I.       DELIVERY OF DISTRIBUTIONS; UNDELIVERABLE OR UNCLAIMED DISTRIBUTIONS

         Distributions to holders of Allowed Claims shall be made by the
Disbursing Agent or the indenture trustee, as the case may be, (a) at the
holder's last known address, (b) at the address in any written notice of address
change delivered to the Disbursing Agent, (c) in the case of the holder of a
Subordinated Note Claim, at the address in the indenture trustee's official
records, or (d) at the address set forth in a properly completed letter of
transmittal accompanying a Certificate properly remitted in accordance with the
terms hereof. If any holder's distribution is returned as undeliverable, no
further distributions to such holder shall be made, unless and until the
Disbursing Agent or indenture trustee is notified of such holder's then current
address, at which time all missed distributions shall be made to such holder
without interest. Amounts in respect of undeliverable distributions made through
the Disbursing Agent or the indenture trustee shall be returned to the
appropriate Reorganized Debtor or the indenture trustee, as the case may be,
until such distributions are claimed. All claims for undeliverable distributions
must be made on or before the second anniversary of the Effective Date, after
which date (i) all Cash in respect of such forfeited distribution including
interest accrued thereon shall revert to Reorganized Group and (ii) all New
Securities in respect of such forfeited distribution shall be cancelled, in each
case, notwithstanding any federal or escheat laws to the contrary.

J.       WITHHOLDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

         In connection with this Plan and all distributions hereunder, the
Disbursing Agent shall, to the extent applicable, comply with all tax
withholding and reporting requirements imposed by any federal, state, local, or
foreign taxing authority, and all distributions hereunder shall be subject to
any such

                                       24
<PAGE>


withholding and reporting requirements. The Disbursing Agent shall be authorized
to take all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and
reporting requirements.

K.       SETOFFS

         Other than in respect of any Existing Credit Agreement Claim, a
Reorganized Debtor may, but shall not be required to, set off against any Claim,
and the payments or other distributions to be made pursuant to this Plan in
respect of such Claim, claims of any nature whatsoever that the Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor may have against the Claim's holder; provided, however, that
neither the failure to do so nor the allowance of any Claim hereunder shall
constitute a waiver or release by the Reorganized Debtor of any claim that the
Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may have against such holder. Nothing in this Plan
shall be deemed to expand rights to setoff under applicable non-bankruptcy law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reorganized Debtors shall be deemed to waive
and shall have no right of setoff or recoupment against any Existing Credit
Agreement Claim or against any amounts at any time due or outstanding under the
DIP Facility.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                       PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED,
                       CONTINGENT, AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS

A.       OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS; DISPUTED CLAIMS

         The Debtors intend to make distributions, as required by this Plan, in
accordance with the books and records of the Debtors (or in the case of the
Existing Bank Debt, in accordance with the books and records of JPMorgan Chase
Bank as Administrative Agent under the Existing Credit Agreement). Unless
disputed by a holder of a Claim or Equity Interest, the amount set forth in the
books and records of the Debtors shall constitute the amount of the Allowed
Claim or Allowed Equity Interest of such holder. If any holder of a Claim or
Equity Interest disagrees with the Debtors, such holders must so advise the
Debtors in writing, in which event, the Claim or Equity Interest shall be a
Disputed Claim or a Disputed Equity Interest. The Debtors intend to attempt to
resolve any such disputes consensually, or through other judicial means outside
of the Bankruptcy Court. Nevertheless, the Debtors may, in their discretion,
file with the Bankruptcy Court (or any other court of competent jurisdiction) an
objection to the allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest, or any other
appropriate motion or adversary proceeding with respect thereto. All such
objections shall be litigated to Final Order; provided, however, that the
Debtors may compromise and settle, withdraw or resolve by any other method,
without requirement of Bankruptcy Court approval, any objections to Claims or
Equity Interests. In addition, any Debtor may, at any time, request that the
Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to
section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law regardless of
whether such Debtor has previously objected to such Claim or whether the
Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court shall
retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim at any time during litigation
concerning any objection to any Claim, including during the pendency of the any
appeal relating to any such objection. In the event the Bankruptcy Court
estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that estimated amount shall
constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a maximum limitation on
such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. If the estimated amount
constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the Debtors may elect to pursue
any supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate distribution on such
Claim. All of the aforementioned Claims objection, estimation, and resolution
procedures are cumulative and are not necessarily exclusive of one another.
Claims may be estimated and thereafter resolved by any permitted mechanism.


                                       25
<PAGE>


B.       NO DISTRIBUTION PENDING ALLOWANCE

         Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any portion of a Claim
is a Disputed Claim, no payment or distribution provided hereunder shall be made
on account of or in exchange for such Claim unless and until such Disputed Claim
becomes an Allowed Claim.

C.       DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ALLOWANCE

         To the extent that a Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest
ultimately becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest, a distribution
shall be made to the holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest in
accordance with the provisions of this Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date that the order or judgment of the Bankruptcy Court or other
applicable court of competent jurisdiction allowing any Disputed Claim or
Disputed Equity Interest becomes a Final Order, the Disbursing Agent shall
provide to the holder of such Claim or Equity Interest the distribution to which
such holder is entitled hereunder on account of or in exchange for such Allowed
Claim.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                        TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS
                              AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

A.       ASSUMED CONTRACTS AND LEASES

         Except as otherwise provided herein, or in any contract, instrument,
release, indenture, or other agreement or document entered into in connection
with this Plan, as of the Effective Date each Reorganized Debtor shall be deemed
to have assumed each executory contract and unexpired lease to which it is a
party, unless such contract or lease (i) was previously assumed or rejected by
the Debtors, (ii) previously expired or terminated pursuant to its own terms,
(iii) is the subject of a motion to reject filed on or before the Confirmation
Date or (iv) is set forth in a schedule, as an executory contract or unexpired
lease to be rejected, filed as part of the Plan Supplement. The Confirmation
Order shall constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court under section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code approving the contract and lease assumptions or rejections
described above, as of the Effective Date.

         Each executory contract and unexpired lease that is assumed and relates
to the use, ability to acquire, or occupancy of real property shall include (a)
all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other agreements
made directly or indirectly by any agreement, instrument, or other document that
in any manner affect such executory contract or unexpired lease and (b) all
executory contracts or unexpired leases appurtenant to the premises, including
all easements, licenses, permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options,
rights of first refusal, powers, uses, usufructs, reciprocal easement
agreements, vaults, tunnel or bridge agreements or franchises, and any other
interests in real estate or rights in rem related to such premises, unless any
of the foregoing agreements has been rejected pursuant to an order of the
Bankruptcy Court.

B.       PAYMENTS RELATED TO ASSUMPTION OF CONTRACTS AND LEASES

         Any monetary amounts by which any executory contract and unexpired
lease to be assumed hereunder is in default shall be satisfied, under section
365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, by the applicable Debtor. If there is a
dispute regarding (i) the nature or amount of any Cure, (ii) the ability of a
Reorganized Debtor or any assignee to provide "adequate assurance of future
performance" (within the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under
the contract or lease to be assumed, or (iii) any other matter pertaining to
assumption, Cure shall occur following the entry of a Final Order of the

                                       26
<PAGE>


Bankruptcy Court resolving the dispute and approving the assumption or
assumption and assignment, as the case may be.

C.       REJECTED CONTRACTS AND LEASES

         Except as otherwise provided herein or in any contract, instrument,
release, indenture or other agreement or document entered into in connection
with this Plan, none of the executory contracts and unexpired leases to which a
Debtor is a party shall be rejected hereunder; provided, however, that the
Debtors reserve the right, at any time prior to the Confirmation Date, to seek
to reject any executory contract or unexpired lease to which either Debtor is a
party.

D.       CLAIMS BASED ON REJECTION OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS OR UNEXPIRED LEASES

         All Claims arising out of the rejection of executory contracts and
unexpired leases must be served upon the appropriate Debtor and its counsel
within 60 days after the earlier of (i) the date of entry of an order of the
Bankruptcy Court approving such rejection or (ii) the Confirmation Date. Any
Claims not filed within such times shall be forever barred from assertion
against the respective Debtor, its Estate, and its property.

E.       COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS AND TREATMENT OF RETIREMENT PLAN

         Except and to the extent previously assumed by an order of the
Bankruptcy Court, on or before the Confirmation Date, all employee compensation
and benefit plans of the Debtors, including benefit plans and programs subject
to sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code, entered into before or
after the Petition Date and not since terminated, shall be deemed to be, and
shall be treated as if they were, executory contracts that are to be assumed
hereunder. The Debtors' obligations under such plans and programs shall survive
Confirmation of this Plan, except for (i) executory contracts or employee
benefit plans specifically rejected pursuant to this Plan (to the extent such
rejection does not violate sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code)
and (ii) such executory contracts or employee benefit plans as have previously
been rejected, are the subject of a motion to reject as of the Confirmation
Date, or have been specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee
benefit plan or contract; provided, however, that the Debtors' obligations, if
any, to pay all "retiree benefits," as defined in section 1114(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, shall continue unimpaired and in full force and effect.

                                   ARTICLE X.

                      ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THIS PLAN

A.       CLASSES ENTITLED TO VOTE

         Each Impaired Class of Claims that shall (or may) receive or retain
property or any interest in property hereunder is entitled to vote to accept or
reject this Plan. Notwithstanding any distribution of Warrants that holders of
Equity Interests in Class 8 may be entitled to receive hereunder, the Debtors
intend to seek entry of an order pursuant to which such holders shall be deemed
to have rejected this Plan and shall not be entitled to vote in respect of this
Plan. By operation of law, each unimpaired Class of Claims or Equity Interests
is deemed to have accepted this Plan and, therefore, is not entitled to vote.
Because holders of Claims and Equity Interests in Classes that are not entitled
to receive or retain any property hereunder are presumed to have rejected this
Plan, they are not entitled to vote.


                                       27
<PAGE>


B.       ACCEPTANCE BY IMPAIRED CLASSES

         An Impaired Class of Claims shall have accepted this Plan if the
holders of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the
Allowed Claims in the Class actually voting have voted to accept this Plan, in
each case not counting the vote of any holder designated under section 1126(e)
of the Bankruptcy Code.

C.       ELIMINATION OF CLASSES

         Any Class that does not contain any Allowed Claims or Equity Interests
or any Claims or Equity Interests temporarily allowed for voting purposes under
Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3018, as of the date of the commencement of
the Confirmation Hearing, shall be deemed not included in this Plan for purposes
of (i) voting to accept or reject this Plan and (ii) determining whether such
Class has accepted or rejected this Plan under section 1129(a)(8) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

D.       NONCONSENSUAL CONFIRMATION

         The Bankruptcy Court may confirm this Plan over the dissent of any
Impaired Class if all of the requirements for consensual confirmation under
subsection 1129(a), other than subsection 1129(a)(8), of the Bankruptcy Code and
for nonconsensual confirmation under of subsection 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code have been satisfied.

         To obtain confirmation notwithstanding the nonacceptance of a Class,
the Debtors must demonstrate to the Court that this Plan "does not discriminate
unfairly" and is "fair and equitable" with respect to any dissenting Impaired
Classes. A plan does not discriminate unfairly if the legal rights of a
dissenting Class are treated in a manner consistent with the treatment of other
classes whose legal rights are substantially similar to those of the dissenting
class and if no class receives more than it is entitled to for its Claims or
Equity Interests. If required, the Debtors shall show at the Confirmation
Hearing that this Plan does not discriminate unfairly.

         To the extent necessary, the Debtors shall request confirmation of this
Plan, as this Plan may be modified from time to time, under section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                       CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THIS PLAN'S
                          CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION

A.       CONDITIONS TO CONFIRMATION

         The Confirmation hereof is subject to the satisfaction or due waiver of
the following conditions precedent:

reasonably acceptable to the Debtors and the Senior Lenders, the Noteholders'
Committee, and Hicks Muse.

         2. The Exit Facility commitment and the Commitment Agreements shall be
in full force and effect and shall not have expired or otherwise terminated.

         such contract or lease (including those described in sections 365(b)(2)
         and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code) that prohibits such assignment or
         transfer or that enables, permits, or requires termination of such
         contract or lease;

                  D. the transfers of property by the Debtors (i) to the
         Reorganized Debtors (A) are or shall be legal, valid, and effective

         Debtors incurred before the Confirmation Date, or from any conduct of
         the Debtors prior to the Confirmation Date, or that otherwise arose
         before the Confirmation Date, including all interest, if any, on any

         3. The New Senior Credit Agreement shall have been executed by all
necessary parties thereto and prior to, or simultaneously with, the

necessary to effectuate the issuance of the New Securities.

Debtors, with the consent of the Senior Lenders, the Noteholders' Committee, and
Hicks Muse (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), without any
notice to other parties in interest or the Bankruptcy Court and without a
hearing. The conditions set forth in Article XI.A above may not be waived
without the consent of the Senior Lenders, the Noteholders' Committee and Hicks
Muse (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld). The failure to satisfy
or waive any condition to confirmation or the Effective Date may be asserted by
the Debtors regardless of the circumstances giving rise to the failure of such
condition to be satisfied (including any action or inaction by the Debtors). The
failure of the Debtors to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any other rights, and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time.

reconcile any inconsistencies herein, the Disclosure Statement, and the
Confirmation Order, and to accomplish such matters as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes and extent hereof so long as such proceedings do not materially
and adversely affect the treatment of holders of Claims or Equity Interests
hereunder.

                                 ARTICLE XIII.

                            RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

                                  ARTICLE XV.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

A.       BAR DATES FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS

         1. ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS

         The Confirmation Order shall establish an Administrative Claims Bar
Date for the filing of all Administrative Claims (other than Professional Fee
Claims or Claims for the expenses of the members of any Committee (if
appointed)), which date shall be 60 days after the Confirmation Date. Holders of
asserted Administrative Claims, other than Professional Fee Claims or Claims for
United States Trustee fees or the expenses of the members of any Committee (if
appointed), not paid and not arising out of transactions in the ordinary course
of business prior to the Confirmation Date must submit proofs of Administrative
Claim on or before such Administrative Claims Bar Date or forever be barred from
doing so. The notice of Confirmation to be delivered pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rules 3020(c) and 2002(f) shall set forth such date and constitute notice of
this Administrative Claims Bar Date. The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as
the case may be, shall have 60 days (or such longer period as may be allowed by
order of the Bankruptcy Court) following the Administrative Claims Bar Date to
review and object to such Administrative Claims before a hearing for
determination of allowance of such Administrative Claim.

         2. PROFESSIONAL FEE CLAIMS

         All final requests for compensation or reimbursement of Professional
Fee Claims pursuant to sections 327, 328, 330, 331, 503(b), or 1103 of the
Bankruptcy Code for services rendered to the Debtors or any Committee (if
appointed) prior to the Effective Date must be filed and served on the
Reorganized Debtors and their counsel no later than 60 days after the Effective
Date, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. Objections to
applications of such Professionals or other entities for compensation or
reimbursement of expenses must be filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors
and their counsel and the requesting Professional or other entity no later than
60 days (or such longer period as may be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy
Court) after the date on which the applicable application for compensation or
reimbursement was served. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reasonable fees and
expenses incurred on or after the Petition Date by Stroock & Stroock & Lavan
LLP, as counsel to the Noteholders' Committee, Jefferies & Company, Inc., as
financial advisors to the Noteholders' Committee, and Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., as
counsel to Hicks Muse, and any other professionals retained by the Noteholders'
Committee or Hicks Muse respectively, including local counsel, pursuant to their
respective agreements entered into prior to, on, or subsequent to the Petition
Date, and the reasonable fees and expenses of the indenture trustees, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, as set forth in the indentures, shall be paid by the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors as Administrative Claims in the ordinary
course of the Debtors' businesses, without application by or on behalf of any
such parties to the Bankruptcy Court, and without notice and a hearing, unless
specifically required by the Bankruptcy Court. If the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors and any such professional or indenture trustee cannot agree on the
amount of fees and expenses to be paid to such party, the amount of fees and
expenses shall be determined by the Bankruptcy Court.

B.       PAYMENT OF STATUTORY FEES

         All fees payable under section 1930 of title 28 of the United States
Code, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation Hearing, shall
be paid on or before the Effective Date. All such fees that arise after the
Effective Date but before the closing of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be paid by
the Reorganized Debtors.


                                       33
<PAGE>


C.       SEVERABILITY OF PLAN PROVISIONS

         If, prior to Confirmation, any term or provision hereof is held by the
Bankruptcy Court to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the Bankruptcy Court, at
the request of the Debtors, shall have the power to alter and interpret such
term or provision to make it valid or enforceable to the maximum extent
practicable, consistent with the original purpose of the term or provision held
to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, and such term or provision shall then be
applicable as altered or interpreted. Notwithstanding any such holding,
alteration, or interpretation, the remainder of the terms and provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired,
or invalidated by such holding, alteration, or interpretation. The Confirmation
Order shall constitute a judicial determination and shall provide that each term
and provision hereof, as it may have been altered or interpreted in accordance
with the foregoing, is valid and enforceable pursuant to its terms.

D.       SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

         The rights, benefits and obligations of all Persons named or referred
to herein shall be binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of, their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives,
successors or assigns.

E.       DISCHARGE OF THE DEBTORS AND INJUNCTION

         All consideration distributed hereunder shall be in exchange for, and
in complete satisfaction, settlement, discharge, and release of, all Claims
against and Equity Interests in the Debtors of any nature whatsoever or against
any of the Debtor's assets or properties. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, entry of the Confirmation Order (subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Date) shall act as a discharge of all Claims against and debt of,
liens on, and Equity Interests in each of the Debtors, the Debtors' assets, and
their properties, arising at any time before the entry of the Confirmation
Order, regardless of whether a proof of Claim or proof of Equity Interest
therefor was filed, whether the Claim or Equity Interest is Allowed, or whether
the holder thereof votes to accept this Plan or is entitled to receive a
distribution thereunder, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date. Upon
entry of the Confirmation Order, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Date, any holder of such discharged Claim or Equity Interest shall be precluded
from asserting against the Debtors or any of their assets or properties any
other or further Claim or Equity Interest based upon any document, instrument,
act, omission, transaction, or other activity of any kind or nature that
occurred before the date of entry of the Confirmation Order except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Plan. The Confirmation Order shall be a judicial
determination of discharge of all liabilities of the Debtors, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Date.

         In accordance with section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code, the discharge
provided by this section and section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code shall act as an
injunction against the commencement or continuation of any action, employment of
process, or act to collect, offset, or recover the Claims and Equity Interest
discharged hereby. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan or the
Confirmation Order, all Persons who have held, hold, or may hold Claims against,
or Equity Interests in, the Debtors shall be permanently enjoined, on and after
the Effective Date, from (i) commencing or continuing in any manner any action
or other proceeding of any kind with respect to any such Claim or Equity
Interest, (ii) the enforcement, attachment, collection, or recovery by any
manner or means of any judgment, award, decree, or order against the Debtors on
account of any such Claim or Equity Interest, (iii) creating, perfecting, or
enforcing any encumbrance of any kind against the Debtors or against the
property or interests in property of the Debtors on account of any such Claim or
Equity Interest, and (iv) asserting any right of setoff, subrogation, or
recoupment of any kind against any obligation due from the Debtors or against
the property or interests in property of the Debtors on account of any such
Claim or


                                       34
<PAGE>


Equity Interest. The foregoing injunction shall extend to successors of the

                      TERMS OF NEW SENIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT

A.       TERM LOAN FACILITIES

         1. STRUCTURE

         The New Senior Credit Facility will provide for an aggregate term loan
facility in the amount of $448.3 million (not including $11.5 million of undrawn
letters of credit issued prior to the Petition Date under the Existing Credit
Agreement) comprising (i) the Term Loan A Facility and (ii) the Term Loan B
Facility and is subject to adjustment as described below. The Term Loan A
Facility is for an amount between $69.5 million and $85.4 million. The final
size of the Term Loan A Facility will be 1.50 times the commitments under the
Exit Facility which are made by lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement to
the extent that such lenders' Existing Credit Agreement Claims are not converted
into equity of Reorganized Group upon confirmation of the Plan. Only those
lenders having Existing Credit Agreement Claims that are not converted into
equity of Reorganized Group upon confirmation of the Plan and having commitments
under the Exit Facility are eligible to participate in the Term Loan A Facility.
The Term Loan B Facility will be for an amount between $362.9 million and $378.8
million. The final size of the Term Loan B Facility will be equal to the amount
of outstanding loans under the Existing Credit Agreement which are not converted
into equity of Reorganized Group upon confirmation of the Plan minus the amount
of the Term Loan A Facility. The size of the New Senior Credit Agreement (and
the relative sizes of the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility) is
subject to adjustment based on any additional commitments under the Exit
Facility that may be received by Group and Viasystems. The Term Loan A Facility
and the Term Loan B Facility, and the liens and guarantees in respect thereof,
will be junior to the Exit Facility, and the liens and guarantees in respect
thereof.

         At the time of the Credit Facility Restructuring, the Borrowers may
retain up to $11.5 million of then-outstanding letters of credit issued prior to
the Petition Date under the Existing Credit Agreement. Such letters of credit
shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding under the New Senior Credit
Agreement, and shall not reduce availability under the Exit Facility. The New
Senior Credit Agreement also will permit Viasystems to have issued new letters
of credit under the Exit Facility. If there is a drawing under any letter of
credit issued prior to the Petition Date under the Existing Credit Agreement,
Senior Lenders that had reimbursement obligations in respect of such letter of
credit under the Existing Credit Agreement must reimburse the issuing bank for
their pro rata share of such drawing and treat such reimbursement as an
additional loan to the Borrowers. The amount of such reimbursement will be added
to the amount of the Term Loan B Facility and allocated to the reimbursing
Senior Lenders. The amount of such reimbursement shall be repaid on September
30, 2008.

         2. INTEREST RATES AND FEES

         The Borrowers may choose to pay interest on advances under the New
Senior Credit Agreement at either the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate plus the
following applicable margin: (i) for Base Rate Term Loan A Facility advances,
3.75% per annum; (ii) for Base Rate Term Loan B Facility advances, 4.25% per
annum; (iii) for Eurodollar Rate Term Loan A Facility advances, 4.75% per annum;
and (iv) for Eurodollar Rate Term Loan B Facility advances, 5.25% per annum.

         The default rate is 2.00% above the rate otherwise applicable. In
addition, any interest, fees and other amounts that are overdue under the New
Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at 5.75% above the Base Rate for Term Loan
A Facility advances and 6.25% above the Base Rate for Term Loan B Facility
advances.


                                      A-1
<PAGE>

         The Borrowers must pay each Senior Lender who consents to the
provisions of the Plan a restructuring fee equal to 1.00% of the principal
amount of such Senior Lender's outstanding loans and participations in letters
of credit and swing line loans under the Existing Credit Agreement immediately
prior to the Effective Date. However, any fees paid to such Senior Lender in
connection with the Fourth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement reduce the
applicable restructuring fee dollar-for-dollar. In addition, the Borrowers must
pay a fronting fee equal to 1/8 of 1% per year on the face amount of all letters
of credit, and an annual administration fee of $200,000 until the repayment in
full of the New Senior Credit Facility.

         3. SECURITY AND GUARANTEES

         Reorganized Group and all of its Subsidiaries formed under the laws of
any state in the United States will jointly and severally guarantee the
Borrowers' obligations under the New Senior Credit Agreement. The collateral for
the New Senior Credit Agreement will be the same collateral as under the
Existing Credit Agreement: all or substantially all of the assets of Reorganized
Group, Reorganized Viasystems and each guarantor. Subject to legal restrictions
and practical considerations, the Borrowers also will cause to be pledged assets
in certain foreign countries, including, to the extent legally feasible and
practicable, the Peoples' Republic of China, as collateral. The Term Loan A
Facility and the Term Loan B Facility, and the liens and guarantees in respect
thereof, will be junior to the Exit Facility, and the liens and guarantees in
respect thereof.

         4. CONDITIONS TO CREDIT FACILITY RESTRUCTURING

         The Credit Facility Restructuring will be conditioned upon satisfaction
of customary conditions for facilities of this type, including the following
conditions precedent on or prior to the Effective Date:

         o        payment by Reorganized Viasystems of the restructuring fee
                  described above;

         o        indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement shall have
                  been reduced by at least $50.0 million in aggregate principal
                  amount by (i) the conversion of indebtedness under the
                  Existing Credit Agreement held by Hicks Muse, other holders of
                  Subordinated Notes and TCW into New Senior Convertible
                  Preferred Stock, and (ii) receipt by Reorganized Viasystems of
                  cash in connection with the Rights Offering which is applied
                  to reduce Existing Bank Debt;

         o        conversion of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes into New
                  Stock;

         o        delivery by the Borrowers of evidence satisfactory to the
                  lenders showing that no cash payment has been made on account
                  of any junior securities of Group and its Subsidiaries or on
                  account of the DTI Guaranty; and

         o        Reorganized Group and its Subsidiaries shall not have any
                  outstanding class of securities that provides for any payment
                  in cash prior to the payment in full of the New Senior Credit
                  Facility.

         5. COVENANTS

         The New Senior Credit Agreement will require Reorganized Viasystems to
observe certain conditions, affirmative covenants and negative covenants
(including financial covenants) which are similar in type to those found in the
Existing Credit Agreement, but will be made more restrictive in various
respects, including the following financial covenants which remain subject to
negotiation: (i)

                                      A-2
<PAGE>


minimum EBITDA, (ii) minimum interest coverage, (iii) maximum total leverage,
(iv) maximum capital expenditures and (v) minimum asset coverage.

         6. MATURITY AND AMORTIZATION

         The Term Loan A Facility will be repayable in consecutive quarterly
installments, commencing on March 31, 2003 and ending on or between March 31,
2005, if the Exit Facility is $51.3 million, and September 30, 2006, if the Exit
Facility is $61.85 million. The ending date for installment payments on the Term
Loan A Facility will depend on the aggregate amount of the Exit Facility.

         The Term Loan B Facility will be repayable in consecutive quarterly
installments, commencing on March 31, 2003 and ending on September 30, 2008.

         The amount of the amortization payments in respect of the Term Loan B
Facility shall be $250,000 in each fiscal quarter until the Term Loan A Facility
has been paid in full. The amount of the amortization payments in respect of the
Term Loan A Facility shall be the amount set forth in the foregoing total
amortization schedule for such quarter minus $250,000. In the quarter in which
the Term Loan A Facility is paid in full, the Term Loan B Facility amortization
shall be $250,000 plus the amount by which the amount that would otherwise be
allocated to the Term Loan A Facility exceeds the outstanding amount of such
Term Loan A Facility at such time.

         In the event that amortization payments are made with respect to the
Existing Credit Agreement subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the
Petition Date, the full amount of any such payments shall

                                      A-3

reduce the respective amortization payments dollar-for-dollar on a pro rata
basis. In addition, the amount of any draws on letters of credit issued under
the Existing Credit Agreement and assumed under the New Senior Credit Agreement
that are reimbursed by Senior Lenders having reimbursement obligations with
respect to such letters of credit under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be
added to the final amortization payment.

         7. PREPAYMENTS

         Optional Prepayments. The Borrowers may prepay the Restructured Loans,
prepay the loans under the Exit Facility and reduce the commitments under the
Exit Facility in a minimum amount of $500,000 and additional integral amounts in
multiples of $100,000. The Senior Lenders will apply Optional prepayments of the
term loans first to outstanding loans under the Term Loan A Facility, then to
outstanding loans under the Term Loan B Facility, in each case, to the next four
installments thereof and thereafter to the installments thereof ratably in
accordance with the then outstanding amounts thereof and may not be reborrowed.
The commitments under the Exit Facility may not be reduced until the repayment
of the Restructured Loans.

         Mandatory Prepayments. The Borrowers must prepay the Restructured Loans
and reduce the commitments under the Exit Facility by the following amounts
(subject to certain exceptions to be negotiated):

         o        an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of any incurrence
                  of indebtedness to be agreed by Reorganized Group or any of
                  its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date;

         o        an amount equal to 75% of the net proceeds of any equity
                  issuances (other than (i) equity of Reorganized Group issued
                  in connection with incentive plans and (ii) common equity
                  infusions from existing equity holders and their respective
                  affiliates) by Reorganized Group or any of its Subsidiaries
                  after the Effective Date;

         o        an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of any sale or
                  other disposition by Reorganized Group or any of its
                  Subsidiaries after the Effective Date of any material assets,
                  except for (i) the sale of inventory or obsolete or worn-out
                  property in the ordinary course of business, (ii) the proceeds
                  of certain specified asset sales, (iii) transfers resulting
                  from casualty or condemnation and (iv) other customary
                  exceptions; provided that the Borrowers may retain the
                  proceeds of the sale of the Richmond Facility to the extent
                  such proceeds do not exceed the difference between $61.85
                  million and the total commitments under the Exit Facility; and

         o        if cash and cash equivalents on hand of Reorganized Group and
                  its Subsidiaries as at December 31 of each fiscal year
                  (commencing with December 31, 2003) exceeds $87.5 million, an
                  amount equal to the lesser of (i) 75% of excess cash flow and
                  (ii) the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand as at
                  such date in excess of $87.5 million.

         The Senior Lenders will apply each mandatory prepayment (a) first, to
the repayment of the loans under the Term Loan A Facility and (b) thereafter, to
the repayment of the loans under the Term Loan B Facility, in each case, ratably
in accordance with the then outstanding amounts thereof. Once the Borrowers pay
all outstanding Restructured Loans, the Borrowers must reduce the commitments in
respect of the Exit Facility and cash collateralize or replace the letters of
credit and prepay loans under the Exit Facility to the extent the aggregate
amount thereof exceeds such commitments as so reduced.

B.       EXIT FACILITY

         1. STRUCTURE

         The Exit Facility will provide Reorganized Viasystems, as borrower, a
revolving credit facility of up to $61.85 million and a letter of credit
subfacility with a sublimit of $15.0 million. The maximum amount of the Exit
Facility (the "Maximum Amount") will be limited to $50.0 million, provided that
the Maximum Amount will increase over $50.0 million, up to a maximum amount of
$61.85 million, by $0.50 for each $1.00 of outstanding debt under the Existing
Credit Agreement held by Hicks Muse that converts to common stock of Reorganized
Group pursuant to the Hicks Muse Exchange. The Maximum Amount will be reduced by
the amount of net proceeds of the sale of Reorganized Viasystems' Richmond,
Virginia facility that are retained by Reorganized Viasystems and not applied as
a prepayment of the New Senior Credit Facility. To be eligible to request a
revolving advance under the Exit Facility, Reorganized Group and its
Subsidiaries must meet a domestic asset coverage test and have less than $20.0
million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at the time of, or
after giving effect to, the borrowing. The Exit Facility, and the liens and
guarantees in respect thereof, will be senior to the Term Loan A Facility and
Term Loan B Facility, and the liens and guarantees in respect thereof.

         2. INTEREST RATES AND FEES

         Reorganized Viasystems may choose to pay interest on advances under the
Exit Facility at either the Eurocurrency Rate plus 4.50% per annum or the Base
Rate plus 3.50% per annum. The default rate is 2.00% above the rate otherwise
applicable. In addition, any interest, fees and other amounts that are overdue
under the Exit Facility bear interest at 5.50% above the Base Rate.

         Reorganized Viasystems must pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on
the average daily unused portion of the Exit Facility and an upfront fee equal
to 0.50% of the aggregate initial commitments for the Exit Facility.

         3. SECURITY AND GUARANTEES

         Reorganized Group and all of its Subsidiaries formed under the laws of
any state in the United States will jointly and severally guarantee Reorganized
Viasystems' obligations under the Exit Facility. The collateral for the Exit
Facility will be the same collateral as under the Existing Credit Agreement: all
or substantially all of the assets of Reorganized Group, Reorganized Viasystems
and each guarantor. In addition, subject to legal restrictions and practical
considerations, Reorganized Viasystems also will cause to be pledged assets in
certain foreign countries, including, to the extent legally feasible and
practicable, the Peoples' Republic of China, as collateral. The Exit Facility,
and the liens and guarantees in respect thereof, will be senior to the Term Loan
A Facility and Term Loan B Facility, and the liens and guarantees in respect
thereof.

         4. COVENANTS

         The Exit Facility will require Reorganized Viasystems to observe the
same affirmative and negative covenants (including financial covenants) as
described above in the description of the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan
B Facility.

         5. MATURITY AND AMORTIZATION

         The Exit Facility will cease to be available on the fifth anniversary
of the closing of the New Senior Credit Agreement.

                                    (the "Notional Conversion Rate"), additional

         Liquidation Preference:    The initial liquidation preference will be
                                    equal to the face amount ($100 per share)
                                    and all accrued but unpaid dividends up to

                                    Notional Conversion Rate would exceed the
                                    foregoing liquidation preference, such
                                    holders shall be entitled to such greater
                                    distribution.

         Rank:                      The New Junior Preferred Stock will rank

Reorganized Group common equity securities following consummation of the Plan or
(ii) the date on which Reorganized Group otherwise becomes subject to the
periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, the holders of 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of registrable New Common Stock (including
securities convertible into New Common Stock), shall be entitled to demand up to
three registrations of their registrable New Common Stock on Form S-3 (or, if
Form S-3 is not then available to Reorganized Group, Form S-1, or any successor
forms).

         All holders of registrable New Common Stock who are a party to the
Stockholders Agreement shall be entitled to participate in any demand
registration on a pro rata basis and the holders shall have a priority over any
shares sought to be sold by Reorganized Group or any person who is not a party
to the Stockholders Agreement in any such registration. Any cutback required
with respect to the holders who are a party to the Stockholders Agreement shall
be effected on a pro rata basis. If a cutback occurs with respect to any such
holder which made a demand registration, then such holder shall receive one
additional demand registration right.

         At any time that Reorganized Group is entitled to register New Common
Stock on Form S-3, the holders of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of
registrable New Common Stock (including securities convertible into New Common

efforts to file and have declared effective a shelf registration statement
covering the resale of the registrable New Common Stock held by such holders.
Subject to customary blackouts, Reorganized Group shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such shelf registration statement
continuously for two years or such shorter period of time which shall terminate
the day after the date on which all of the registrable New Common Stock covered

account or for the account of any other holders. Reorganized Group shall have
priority in any registration it has initiated for its own account, including any
demand registration

rights shall be effected on a pro rata basis.

Common Stock is to be underwritten, with respect to (i) any demand registration,
the holders of a majority of the shares being offered shall select a nationally
recognized firm of underwriters, with the consent of Reorganized Group, which
will not be unreasonably withheld and (ii) any registration initiated by
Reorganized Group for its own account, Reorganized Group shall select a
nationally recognized firm of underwriters in its sole discretion. Reorganized
Group may elect to convert any demand registration into a registration for its
own account, in which case Reorganized Group shall select a nationally
recognized firm of underwriters in its sole discretion. If Reorganized Group
makes such election then any holder that exercised its demand registration right
which was so converted shall receive one additional demand registration right.

         Blackouts. Reorganized Group shall have a customary right to suspend,
at any time (but not to exceed one time in any twelve-month period) the

file and have declared effective a shelf registration statement covering the
resale of the registrable New Junior Preferred Stock of such holders. Subject to
