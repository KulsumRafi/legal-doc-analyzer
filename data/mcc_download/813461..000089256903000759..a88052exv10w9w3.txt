                             THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE

                       REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT

This THIRD AMENDMENT ("Amendment") is dated as of January 1, 2002, by and
between WFS FINANCIAL INC, a California corporation ("WFS"), and WESTERN
FINANCIAL BANK, a federally-chartered savings bank (the "Bank"), and amends the
REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") entered into by the parties on
June 15, 1999, pursuant to the transfer of certain assets of the Bank to WFS.

                                    RECITALS

A.      The Agreement is being amended to reflect differing interest spreads.

                                    AGREEMENT

        In consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein, and in
reliance upon the recitals set forth above, the parties agree as follows:

    1.    CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

          The definition of "INTEREST SPREAD" is hereby amended as follows:

          "INTEREST SPREAD" shall mean (1) 125 basis points over one-month LIBOR
          for unsecured borrowings and, (2) 90 basis points over one-month LIBOR
          for secured borrowings. In both cases, the LIBOR rate used shall be
          the rate on the last day of the prior month.

    2.    Except as specifically amended herein, all terms of the Agreement as
          previously amended by First and Second amendments to the Agreement
          shall remain in full force and effect.

Wherefore, the undersigned have executed this Amendment on the date set forth
below to be effective as of the date first set forth above.

WFS FINANCIAL INC                             WESTERN FINANCIAL BANK
