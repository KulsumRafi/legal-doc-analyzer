         SECTION 9.01. General. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by the
Act, the Company shall indemnify each Person made or threatened to be made a
party to any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the
fact that such Person or such Person's testator or intestate is or was a member
or officer of the Company, against judgments, fines (including excise taxes
assessed on a Person with respect to an employee benefit plan), penalties,
amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees,
actually and necessarily incurred in connection with such action or proceeding,
or any appeal therefrom; provided that no such indemnification shall be made if
a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such Person establishes that
his conduct did not meet the then applicable minimum statutory standards of
conduct; and provided, further, that no such indemnification shall be required
in connection with any settlement or other non-adjudicated disposition of any
threatened or pending action or proceeding unless the Company has given its
prior consent to such settlement or such other disposition, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

         SECTION 9.02. Reimbursement. The Company shall advance or promptly
reimburse, upon request, any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder for
all expenses, including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred in defending any
action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Person (in form and substance
satisfactory to the Company) to repay such amount if such Person is ultimately
found not to be entitled to indemnification or, where indemnification is
granted, to the extent the expenses so advanced or reimbursed exceed the amount
to which such Person is entitled; provided that such Person shall cooperate in
good faith with any request by the Company that common counsel be utilized by
the parties to an action or proceeding who are similarly situated unless to do
so would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest
between or among such parties; and provided, further, that the Company shall
only advance attorneys' fees in respect of legal counsel approved by the
Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

         SECTION 9.03. Availability. The right to indemnification and
advancement of expenses under this provision is intended to be retroactive and

enter into agreements with any of its members or officers extending rights to

permitted by applicable law, but the failure to enter into any such agreement
shall not affect or limit the rights of such Person pursuant to this provision.

         SECTION 9.05. Enforceability. In case any provision in this Article IX
shall be determined at any time to be unenforceable in any respect, the other
provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and the
affected provisions shall be given the fullest possible enforcement in the
circumstances, it being the intention of the Company to provide indemnification
and advancement of expenses to its members and officers, acting in such
capacities, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

         SECTION 9.06. No Amendments. No amendment or repeal of this provision

expenses to, the Member or any officer of the Company for, or with respect to,
acts or omissions of such Member or officer occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal.

         SECTION 9.07. Not Exclusive. The foregoing shall not be exclusive of
any other rights to which the Member or any officer may be entitled as a matter
of law and shall not affect any rights to indemnification to which Company
personnel other than the Member or officers may be entitled by contract or
otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE X
