         Subject to Section VII, Participants in the Plan will be selected from
those key employees of the Company whose efforts are expected to contribute
materially to the efforts and success of the Company. No employee will be a
Participant until he or she has executed a Retention Agreement. No employee will

Retention Agreement may provide for other offsets under the Plan or any other
plan, program or agreement of or with the Corporation or the Company in which a
Participant participates or to which he or she is a party.

            IV.      Administration

approval as further described in Section XV.

            V.       Awards; Vesting

         The Company and each Participant will execute a Retention Agreement
that sets forth the terms and timing of the grant, vesting and payment of an
Award. Subject to the terms of the Retention Agreement, an Award will be earned
by and vested in a Participant based upon continued employment on each Vesting
Date. Awards will not be considered compensation for purposes of the Company's
pension and welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements.

            VI.      Payment of Awards

         Awards earned and vested will become payable as provided in the
Retention Agreement.

            VII.     Discretionary Fund

         In addition to the payments of the Awards reflected in the budget
approved by the Bankruptcy Court on September 3, 2002, a Discretionary Fund in
the amount of $1,000,000 is established under the Plan to be available to
provide, if the CEO so decides, additional Awards hereunder, on a case-by-case
basis, to employees of the Company under circumstances that may arise and that
are not otherwise addressed herein. Such payments shall be made in the sole
discretion of the CEO to address specific retention issues and may be used for
new employees, employees not otherwise covered under the Plan and Participants
viewed by the CEO as having a high departure risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section, if the CEO proposes to use more than $50,000 from
the Discretionary Fund to provide an Award to an employee who is a Participant,
such Award shall not be made without first obtaining approval of such Award from
the Bankruptcy Committees.

            VIII. Termination of Employment

            (a)   Except as otherwise set forth in a Retention Agreement with
      respect to a Prorating Event, a Participant will be eligible to receive
      payment of his or her Award only if the Participant is employed by the
      Company on the Vesting Date. In the event of a Participant's termination
      of employment with the Company for any reason other than a Prorating
      Event, any Award or portion thereof not yet vested will be immediately
      forfeited.

            (b)   If within ninety (90) days following the payment of any Award,
      a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for any reason
      other than as a result of a Prorating Event, the Participant must
      immediately return such payment to the Company.

            IX.   Non-Alienation of Benefits

         A Participant may not assign, sell, encumber, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any rights or interests under the Plan except by will or the laws of
descent and distribution. Any attempted disposition in contravention of the
preceding sentence will be null and void.

            X.       No Claim or Right to Plan Participation

         No employee or other person will have any claim or right to be selected
as a Participant under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken pursuant
to the Plan will be construed as giving any employee any right to be retained in
the employ of the Company.

            XI.      Taxes

         The Company will deduct from all amounts paid under the Plan all
federal, state, local and other taxes required by law to be withheld with
respect to such payments.

            XII.     Designation and Change of Beneficiary

         Each Participant may designate one or more persons as the Designated
Beneficiary who will be entitled to receive the amount, if any, payable under
the Plan upon the death of the Participant. Such designation will be in writing
to the Committee. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his or
her Designated Beneficiary without the consent of any prior Designated
Beneficiary by filing a written designation with the Committee. The last such
designation received by the Committee will be controlling; provided, however,
that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, will be effective unless
received by the Committee prior to the Participant's death, and in no event will
it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt.

            XIII.    Payments to Persons Other Than the Participant

         If the Committee finds that any person to whom any amount is payable
under the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or
accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment due to such person or his
or her estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed
legal representative) may, if the Committee so directs, be paid to his or her
spouse, a child, a relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of
such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee, in its sole
discretion, to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled
to payment. Any such payment will be a complete discharge of the liability of
the Company therefor.

            XIV.     No Liability of Board or Committee Members or Officers

         No member of the Board or the Committee, any Officer, any employee or
the CEO will be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument
related to the Plan executed by such Officer, such employee, the CEO or by such
member or on his or her behalf in his or her capacity as a member of the Board
or the Committee, nor for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the
Company will indemnify and hold harmless each employee, Officer, the CEO or a
director of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration
or interpretation of the Plan may be allocated or delegated, against any cost or
expense (including legal fees, disbursements and other related charges) or
liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of
the Board of Directors) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection
with the Plan unless arising out of such person's own fraud or bad faith.

            XV.      Termination or Amendment of the Plan

         The Plan may only be amended, suspended or terminated upon approval of
the Bankruptcy Court. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Plan may not
be amended in any way to reduce the benefits payable hereunder to a Participant
or otherwise to impair his or her ability to receive any amount due hereunder,
without the prior written consent of the Participant. The Plan will
automatically terminate when all benefits payable hereunder have been paid.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, no new Awards shall be granted
after March 31, 2004, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section VII of
this Plan.

            XVI.     Establishment of Trust

         A portion of the Company's obligations under the Plan has been secured
by the establishment of a trust for the benefit of two Participants, Messrs.
LaDuc and Bonn. Such Participants may be paid the Awards from the trust, but if
the trust has insufficient funds, then the balance of the Awards will be paid by
the Company.

         The Plan is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

            XVII.    Governing Law

         The terms of the Plan and all rights thereunder will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

            XVIII.   Effective Date

         The effective date of the Plan is September 3, 2002.
