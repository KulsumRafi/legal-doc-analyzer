  to the terms and conditions hereof, the Holder (as defined below) is hereby
  granted the right to purchase, at any time from the date hereof until 5:30 p.m.,
  New York time, on ___________, 2008 [such date shall be the fifth anniversary
  of the closing date of the Corporation's offering of investment units comprised
  of shares of Series F Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock
  pursuant to that certain Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated February
  __, 2003 (the &quot;Memorandum&quot;), and in the event that Units pursuant
  to the Memorandum are issued at more than one closing, a separate Warrant shall
  be issued at each such closing, which Warrant shall expire on the fifth anniversary
  of the date of such closing] (the &quot;Warrant Exercise Term&quot;), _________
  shares of common stock (&quot;Common Stock&quot;), par value, $0.001 per share,
  of the Socket Communications, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) at a price of $_____
  per share (the &quot;Exercise Price&quot;) (such number of shares subject to
  this Warrant and such Exercise Price being subject to adjustment as provided
  herein). This Warrant is being issued pursuant to that certain Placement Agency
  Agreement, dated February ___, 2003 between the Company and Spencer Trask Ventures,
  Inc. (the &quot;Agency Agreement&quot;). All terms not otherwise defined herein
  shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agency Agreement.<br>
  <br>
  2. <u>Exercise of Warrant.</u><br>
  <br>
  2.1. <u>Method of Exercise</u>. This Warrant is exercisable at the Exercise
  Price per share of Common Stock set forth above payable by wire transfer, certified
  or official bank check or in New York Clearing House funds, subject to adjustment
  as provided herein. Upon surrender of this Warrant with the annexed Form of
  Election to Purchase duly executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price
  (as hereinafter defined) for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
  of this Warrant (the &quot;Warrant Shares&quot;) at the Company's principal
  offices, currently at 37400 Central Court, Newark, CA 94560, the registered
  holder of this Warrant (&quot;Holder&quot;) shall be entitled to receive a certificate
  or certificates for the shares of Common Stock so purchased. The purchase rights
  represented by this Warrant are exercisable at the option of the Holder thereof,
  in whole or in part (but not as to fractional shares of the Common Stock underlying
  this Warrant). This Warrant may be exercised to purchase all or part of the
  shares subject to this Warrant. In the case of purchase of less than all the
  shares of Common Stock purchasable under this Warrant, the Company shall cancel
  this Warrant upon the surrender thereof and shall execute and deliver a new
  Warrant of like tenor for the balance of the shares of Common Stock.<br>
  <br>
  2.2.<u> Conversion of Warrant</u>. In addition to the method of payment set
  forth in Section 2.1 and in lieu of any cash payment required thereunder, the
  Holder(s) of the Warrant shall have the right at any time and from time to time,
  provided that the Common Stock (or any equity security into which the Common
  Stock may be exchanged or converted) is registered under the Securities Exchange
  Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), to convert this Warrant
  into shares of Common Stock in full or in part by surrendering this Warrant
  in the manner specified in Section 2.1 in exchange for the number of shares
  of Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares subject to
  the Warrant being surrendered, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
  which is the Market Price (as defined below) of the Common Stock less the Exercise
  Price, and the denominator of which is such Market Price.<br>
  <br>
  Solely for the purposes of this Section 2.2, the &quot;Market Price&quot; at
  any date shall be calculated as the average of the last reported sale prices
  for the Common Stock for the three (3) trading days preceding the date on which
  the annexed Form of Election is delivered to the Company, as officially reported
  by the Nasdaq Stock Market (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the Nasdaq
  Stock Market, by the Pacific Stock Exchange or such other exchange or trading
  system on which the Common Stock is then listed or admitted to trading) <br>
  <br>
  3. <u>Issuance of Certificates</u>. Upon the exercise of this Warrant, certificates
  for shares of Common Stock or other securities, properties or rights issuable
  upon such exercise, shall be issued forthwith (and in any event such issuance
  shall be made within five business days) without charge to the Holder thereof
  including, without limitation, any tax which may be payable by the Company in
  respect of the issuance thereof, and such certificates shall (subject to the
  provisions of Section 4 hereof) be issued in the name of, or in such names as
  may be directed by, the Holder thereof; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that
  the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect
  to any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificates
  in a name other than that of the Holder and the Company shall not be required
  to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or people requesting
  the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or
  it shall be established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has
  been paid. <br>
  The certificates representing the shares of Common Stock (and/or other securities,
  property or rights issuable upon exercise of this Warrant) shall be executed
  on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile signature of the then present
  Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or President or Vice President
  of the Company under its corporate seal reproduced thereon, attested to by the
  manual or facsimile signature of the then present Secretary or Assistant Secretary
  of the Company. <br>

  so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general service
  of process where it is not so subject or would subject the Company to any tax
  in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.<br>
  <br>
  (d) The Company shall indemnify the Holder(s) of the Warrant Shares to be sold
  pursuant to any registration statement and each person, if any, who controls

  the Exchange Act, against all loss, claim, damage, expense or liability (including
  all expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
  any claim whatsoever) to which any of them may become subject to the same extent
  and with the same effect as the provisions pursuant to which the Company has
  agreed to indemnify the Agent pursuant to Section 7 of the Agency Agreement.<br>
  <br>
  (e) The Holder(s) of the Warrant Shares to be sold pursuant to a registration
  statement, and their successors and assigns, shall severally, and not jointly,

  the same effect as the provisions contained in Section 7 of the Agency Agreement
  pursuant to which the Agent has agreed to indemnify the Company.<br>
  <br>
  (f) Nothing contained in this Warrant shall be construed as requiring the Holder
  to exercise this Warrant prior to the initial filing of any registration statement
  or the effectiveness thereof.<br>
  <br>
  (g) The Company shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
  (the &quot;Commission&quot;) such amendments and post-effective amendments to

  <br>
  5. <u>Adjustments to Exercise Price and Number of Securities.</u><br>
  <br>
  5.1. <u>Computation of Adjusted Exercise Price</u>. Except as hereinafter provided,
  in case the Company shall at any time after the date hereof issue or sell any
  shares of its Stock (as defined below), other than the issuance or sales referred
  to in Section 5.6 hereof, including shares held in the Company's treasury and
  shares of Stock issued upon the exercise of any options, rights or warrants,
  to subscribe for shares of Stock issued upon the direct or indirect conversion
  or exchange of securities for shares of Stock, for a consideration per share
  less than the applicable Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance
  or sale of such shares, or without consideration, then forthwith upon such issuance
  or sale, the Exercise Price shall (until another such issuance or sale) be reduced
  to the price (calculated to the nearest full cent) determined by multiplying
  such Exercise Price by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be (1) the
  number of shares of Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, plus
  (2) the number of shares of Stock which the aggregate consideration received
  by the Company in connection with such issuance or sale would purchase at that
  Exercise Price, and (y) the denominator of which shall be (1) the number of
  shares of Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus (2) the number
  of shares of Stock issued in connection with such issuance or sale, provided,
  however, that in no event shall the Exercise Price be adjusted pursuant to this
  computation to an amount in excess of the Exercise Price in effect immediately
  prior to such computation, except in the case of a combination of outstanding
  shares of Stock, as provided by Section 5.3 hereof.<br>
  For purposes of any computation to be made in accordance with this Section 5.1,
  the following provisions shall be applicable:<br>
  <br>
  (a) In case of the issuance or sale of shares of Stock for a consideration which
  shall be cash, the amount of the cash consideration, shall be deemed to be the
  amount of cash received by the Company for such shares. <br>
  <br>
  (b) In case of the issuance or sale (otherwise than as a dividend or other distribution
  on any stock of the Company) of shares of Stock for a consideration part or
  all of which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration therefore
  other than cash shall be deemed to be the value of such consideration as determined
  in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.<br>
  <br>
  (c) Shares of Stock issuable by way of dividend or other distribution on any
  capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have been issued immediately
  after the opening of business on the day following the record date for the determination
  of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution and
  shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration.<br>
  <br>
  (d) The reclassification of securities of the Company other than shares of Stock
  into securities including shares of Stock shall be deemed to involve the issuance
  of such shares of Stock for consideration other than cash immediately prior
  to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of security
  holders entitled to receive such shares, and the value of the consideration
  allocable to such shares of Stock shall be determined as provided in subsection
  (b) of this Section 5.1. The number of shares of Stock at any one time outstanding
  shall include the aggregate number of shares issued or issuable (subject to
  readjustment upon the actual issuance thereof) upon the exercise of then outstanding
  options, rights, warrants and upon the conversion or exchange of then outstanding
  convertible or exchangeable securities.<br>
  <br>
  5.2.<u> Options, Rights, Warrants and Convertible and Exchangeable Securities.</u><br>
  <br>
  In case the Company shall at any time after the date hereof issue options, rights
  or warrants to subscribe for shares of Stock, or issue any securities convertible
  into or exchangeable for shares of Stock, for a consideration per share less
  than the Exercise Price in effect, or without consideration, the Exercise Price
  in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such options, rights, warrants
  or such convertible or exchangeable securities, as the case may be, shall be
  reduced to a price determined by making a computation in accordance with the
  provisions of Section 5.1 hereof; <u>provided</u>, that:<br>
  <br>
  (a) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Stock, as the case may be, issuable
  under such options, rights or warrants shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding
  at the time such options, rights or warrants were issued, for a consideration
  equal to the minimum purchase price per share provided for in such options,
  rights or warrants at the time of issuance, plus the consideration (determined
  in the same manner as consideration received on the issue or sale of shares
  in accordance with the terms of this Warrant), if any, received by the Company
  for such options, rights or warrants.<br>
  <br>
  (b) The aggregate maximum number of shares of Stock issuable upon conversion
  or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities shall be deemed to
  be issued and outstanding at the time of issuance of such securities, and for
  a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the same manner as
  consideration received on the issue or sale of shares of Stock in accordance
  with the terms of this Warrant) received by the Company for such securities,
  plus the minimum consideration, if any, receivable by the Company upon the conversion
  or exchange thereof.<br>
  <br>
  (c) If any change shall occur in the price per share provided for in any of
  the options, rights or warrants referred to in subsection (a) of this Section
  5.2, or in the price per share at which the securities referred to in subsection
  (b) of this Section 5.2 are convertible or exchangeable, such options, rights
  or warrants or conversion or exchange rights, as the case may be, shall be deemed
  to have expired or terminated on the date when such price change became effective
  in respect to shares not theretofore issued pursuant to the exercise or conversion
  or exchange thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have issued upon such
  date new options, rights or warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities
  at the new price in respect of the number of shares issuable upon the exercise
  of such options, rights or warrants or the conversion or exchange of such convertible
  or exchangeable securities.<br>
  <br>
  5.3. <u>Subdivision, Combination and Reclassification. </u><br>
  <br>
  (a) In case the Company shall at any time subdivide or combine the outstanding
  shares of Stock, the Exercise Price shall forthwith be proportionately decreased
  in the case of subdivision or increased in the case of combination. <br>
  <br>
  (b) Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to the provisions of
  Section 5.3(a), the number of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant
  shall be adjusted to the nearest full amount by multiplying a number equal to
  the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number
  of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to
  such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained by the adjusted Exercise
  Price.<br>
  <br>
  5.4. <u>Definition of Stock</u>. For the purpose of this Warrant, the term &quot;Stock&quot;
  shall mean Common Stock and any class or series of preferred stock, or any other
  class of stock or equity security or any other class of stock or equity security
  resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such Stock consisting
  solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no
  par value to par value. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">5.5. <u>Merger or Consolidation.</u>
  In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company with,
  or merger of the Company into, another corporation (other than a consolidation
  or merger which does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding
  Stock), this Warrant shall thereafter be exercisable for number of shares of
  capital stock or other securities or property of the Company or the surviving
  entity to which the Holder would have been entitled if the Holder had exercised
  the Warrant in full immediately prior to such merger or consolidation. <br>
  <br>
  5.6. <u>No Adjustment of Exercise Price in Certain Cases.</u> No adjustment
  of the Exercise Price shall be made pursuant to Sections 5.1 or 5.2:<br>

  new securities issued in accordance with the Agency Agreement or pursuant to
  the offering of the Units;<br>

  <br>
  (j) If the amount of said adjustment shall be less than one cent ($0.01) per

  such case any adjustment that would otherwise be required then to be made shall
  be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next

  issuable upon the exercise thereof. The Company covenants and agrees that, upon
  exercise of this Warrant and payment of the Exercise Price therefore or surrender
  pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, all shares of Common Stock and other securities
  issuable upon such exercise shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
  and not subject to the preemptive rights of any stockholder. As long as this
  Warrant shall be outstanding and the Company shall have a class of its securities
  registered under the Act or the Exchange Act, the Company shall use its best
  efforts to cause all shares of Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant
  to be listed (subject to official notice of issuance) on all security exchanges
  on which the Common Stock issued to the public in connection herewith may then
  be listed and/or quoted.<br>
  <br>
  9. <u>Notices to Warrant Holders.</u> Nothing contained in this Warrant shall
  be constructed as conferring upon the Holders the right to vote or to consent
  or to receive notice to stockholders in respect of any meetings of stockholders
  for the election of directors or any other matter, or as having any rights whatsoever
  as a stockholder of the Company. If, however, at any time prior to the expiration
  of this Warrant and their exercise, any of the following events shall occur:<br>
  <br>
  (a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the
  purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, any right
  to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of
  stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other
  right; or<br>
  <br>
  (b) there shall be any capital reorganization (provided that such reorganization
  requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company), any reclassification
  or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company or any consolidation
  or merger of the Company with another company, or any sale, transfer or other
  disposition of all or substantially all the property, assets or business of
  the Company; or<br>
  <br>
  (c) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding
  up of the Company;<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">then, in any one or more
  of said events, the Company shall give written notice of such event at least
  twenty (20)days prior to the date fixed as a record date for the dividend or
  the date of closing the transfer books for the determination of the issuance
  of any convertible or exchangeable securities or subscription rights, options
  or warrants or for the determination of the persons or entitled to vote on such
  proposed dissolution, liquidation, winding up or sale. Such notice shall specify
  such record date or the date of closing the transfer books, as the case may
  be. Failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity
  of any action taken in connection with the declaration or payment of any such
  dividend, or the issuance of any convertible or exchangeable securities or subscription
  rights, options or warrants, or any proposed dissolution, liquidation winding
  up or sale.<br>
  <br>

  14. <u>Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction</u>. This Warrant shall be
  deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for
  all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State without
  giving effect to the rules of said State governing conflicts of laws.<br>
  <br>
  The Company, the Agent and the Holders hereby agree that any action, proceeding
  or claim against it arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Warrant
  shall be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York, and irrevocably
  submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive. The Company,

  matter hereof and may not be modified or amended except by a writing duly signed

  <br>
  17. <u>Captions</u>. The caption headings of the Sections of this Warrant are

  <br>
  18. <u>Benefits of this Warrant</u>. Nothing in this Warrant shall be construed

  shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company and the Agent and
  any other Holder(s) of this Warrant or Warrant Shares.<br>
  <br>
  19. <u>Limitation on Number of Warrant Shares</u>. The Company shall not be
  obligated to issue any Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant if the issuance
  of such shares of Common Stock would cause the Company to exceed that number
  of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon exercise of this
  Warrant (the &quot;Exchange Cap&quot;) without breaching the Company's obligations
  under the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ (the &quot;Principal Exchange&quot;),
  except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (a)
  obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the Principal Exchange
  (or any successor rule or regulation) for issuances of Common Stock in excess
  of such amount (&quot;Required Stockholder Approval&quot;), (b) obtains a written
  opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required,
  which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holder or (c) is not the
  surviving entity in a merger, acquisition or other business combination transaction.
  If required and requested by the Agent, the Company agrees that the Required
  Stockholder Approval will be presented as a proposal with the recommendation
  of the Board of Directors at its next annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders
  that is called for some other purpose. If the issuance of all of the Warrant
  Shares underlying the aggregate Warrants then outstanding would exceed the Exchange
  Cap then available, and the Company shall not have previously obtained the Required
  Stockholder Approval applicable to approve the issuance of shares of Common
  Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap, then the Company shall issue to the Holder
  requesting a Warrant exercise such number of Warrant Shares equal to its pro-rate
  portion of the Exchange Cap then available determined by dividing (x) the aggregate
  number of Warrant Shares underlying the Warrants held by such Holder by (y)
  the aggregate number of Warrant Shares underlying all of the Warrants then outstanding.
