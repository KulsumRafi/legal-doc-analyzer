                                 PROMISSORY NOTE

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Biltmore Club Apartments, L.L.C.,
a Delaware limited liability company having an address of 921 Bergen Avenue,

to pay to the order of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., having an address
at 4 World Financial Center, 250 Vesey Street, New York, NY, 10080 (the
"Holder"), or at such other place as Holder may from time to time designate in

DOLLARS ($9,300,000.00), in lawful money of the United States of America, and
all other amounts due or becoming due hereunder, with interest on the principal
sum outstanding from time to time (the "Principal Amount") from the date hereof
on the terms herein provided through the date that the loan evidenced hereby
(the "Loan") is repaid in full, in lawful money of the United States of America,
at an interest rate of five and seventy five hundredths percent (5.75%) per
annum (the "Interest Rate"). All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have
the same meanings set forth in the Mortgage (as hereinafter defined).


                            SECTION I. PAYMENT TERMS

         A. Payments under this Note shall be due and payable as follows:

                           (1) interest from the date hereof through the last
                  day of the current month shall be paid on the date hereof;
                  thereafter

                           (2) interest and principal shall be due and payable
                  in equal consecutive monthly installments of FIFTY FOUR

                  ($54,272.28) on the first day of each and every calendar month
                  (each, a "Payment Date") commencing in April, 2003; and

                           (3) the entire Principal Amount, together with all
                  accrued and unpaid interest and any other charges due hereon
                  shall be due and payable on the Payment Date in March, 2013
                  (the "Maturity Date").

         B. Interest shall be computed and shall be payable using the actual
number of days elapsed for the relevant payment period, based on a 360-day year.
Amortization of the Principal Amount shall be in accordance with the
amortization schedule attached hereto as Schedule A. In computing the number of
days during which interest accrues on any amount outstanding hereunder, the
first date from which interest is stated to accrue hereunder shall be included

<PAGE>

         C. All payments made pursuant to this Note shall be made by check
(subject to collection) or by wire transfer to Holder's office. Such payments
must be received by Holder before 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time, in order to be
credited as a payment received that date.

         D. All amounts due under this Note shall be payable without setoff,
counterclaim or any other deduction whatsoever.

         E. Provided no Event of Default ("Event of Default") exists under that
certain Multifamily Deed of Trust, Security Agreement, Assignment of Rents and
Fixture Filing dated as of the date hereof, given by Maker to First American
Title Insurance Company, as trustee, for the benefit of Holder, which encumbers
certain property described therein (the "Property") and secures the Loan
evidenced by this Note (the "Mortgage"), all payments received by Holder on this
Note shall be applied first, to the repayment of sums advanced by Holder to
protect or preserve the Property pursuant to the Mortgage and other loan
documents relating to the Loan (the "Loan Documents"), second, to late charges
and other premiums and charges, third, to interest and finally, to principal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after an Event of Default, all payments
received by Holder on this Note shall be applied by Holder to principal,
interest and/or other charges due hereunder or under the other Loan Documents in
such order as Holder shall determine in its sole discretion.

         F. To the extent that Maker makes any payment or Holder receives any
payment or proceeds for Maker's benefit, which are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to
a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under
any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the
obligations of Maker hereunder intended to be satisfied shall be reinstated and
continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Holder.

                     SECTION II. NO PREPAYMENTS; DEFEASANCE

         A. For purposes of this provision, the following definitions shall
apply:

amended from time to time or any successor statute.

                  (2) "Defeasance Collateral" shall mean U.S. Obligations (as
hereinafter defined) which are identified by Maker (but if not identified by
Maker, then selected by Holder) and that provide for payments prior, but as
close as possible, to the Payment Dates for all Scheduled Defeasance Payments
(as hereinafter defined), with each payment on such U.S. Obligations (together
with any unexpended portion of any prior payment) being equal to or greater than
the corresponding Scheduled Defeasance Payment.

                  (3) "Defeasance Deposit" shall mean an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the sum of the cost of the Defeasance Collateral and
all costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection therewith,
including without limitation any revenue, documentary stamp or intangible taxes
or any other tax or charge due in connection with the defeasance of the Loan.

Ratings Group, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc. or any successors
thereto.

<PAGE>

                  (5) "REMIC" shall mean a "real estate mortgage investment
conduit" as such term is defined in Section 860D(a) of the Code.

                  (6) "Scheduled Defeasance Payments" shall mean all successive
scheduled payments due hereunder on each Payment Date after the Defeasance Date

                  (8) "U.S. Obligations" shall mean direct non-callable
obligations of the United States of America, reasonably acceptable to Holder.

         B. Maker shall not be entitled to prepay this Note in whole or in part
at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) this Note may be prepaid in
whole during the three (3) month period prior to the Maturity Date, without any
Prepayment Charge (as defined in Section VI hereof) or similar premium, provided
that no Event of Default exists and (ii) no Prepayment Charge or similar premium
shall be payable with respect to a prepayment resulting from Holder's election
to apply any proceeds paid in connection with a casualty to or condemnation of
the Property to reduce the indebtedness evidenced hereby.

         C. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, at any
time after the date which is the earlier to occur of (i) two (2) years after the
Startup Day or (ii) four (4) years after the date hereof if the aforesaid
Startup Day shall not have occurred during such four (4) years and, in either
case, provided no default exists hereunder and no Event of Default exists, Maker
may cause the Property to be released from the lien of the Mortgage and the
Defeasance Collateral to be substituted therefor as security for the Loan,
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent (a "Defeasance
Event"):

                  (1) not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall

which the Defeasance Event is to occur;

                  (2) all accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums due

connection with the Defeasance Event (including, without limitation, the review
of the proposed Defeasance Collateral and the preparation of the Defeasance
Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined), legal opinions, mathematical
verifications by a certified public accountant and related documentation), shall
be paid in full on or prior to the Defeasance Date;

                  (3) Maker shall remit the Defeasance Deposit to Holder;

                  (4) Maker shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, to Holder on or prior to the Defeasance Date:


                                       3
<PAGE>

                           (a) a pledge and security agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Holder, creating a first priority security
interest in favor of Holder in the Defeasance Collateral (the "Defeasance
Security Agreement"), which shall provide, among other things, that any excess
received by Holder from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable by
Maker hereunder, to the extent not required to make subsequent payments due
hereunder, shall be refunded to Maker promptly after each monthly Payment Date;

                           (b) a certificate of Maker certifying that all of the
requirements set forth in this Section II.C have been satisfied and that the
defeasance of the Loan is being undertaken to facilitate the disposition of the
Property or other customary commercial transaction;

                           (c) an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Holder (i) from counsel to Holder stating, among
other things, that Holder has a perfected first priority security interest in
the Defeasance Collateral and, if this Note is owned by a REMIC at the time of
the Assumption (as hereinafter defined), if applicable, the Assumption will not
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of such REMIC under the
applicable provisions of the Code or cause such REMIC to incur any liability for
federal income taxes and (ii) from counsel for Maker stating, among other
things, that the Defeasance Security Agreement is enforceable against Maker in
accordance with its terms;

                           (d) if required by Holder in its reasonable
discretion, evidence in writing from the applicable Rating Agencies to the
effect that the defeasance of the Loan will not result in a downgrading,
withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings of any securities backed
by this Note (including, without limitation, any securities issued by a REMIC
which holds this Note) which ratings are in effect immediately prior to such
Defeasance Event.

                           (e) Maker and any guarantor or indemnitor of Maker's
obligations under the Loan Documents for which Maker has personal liability
execute and deliver to Holder such documents and agreements as Holder shall
reasonably require to evidence and effectuate the ratification of such personal
liability and guaranty or indemnity, respectively;

                           (f) a ratification of all representations and
obligations under the Loan Documents and such other certificates, documents or
instruments as Holder may reasonably require; and

                           (g) if required by the Rating Agencies, a certificate
from a certified public accountant that the Defeasance Collateral is sufficient
to cover the remaining interest and principal payments under the Loan.

                  (5) Maker, as directed by Holder, shall have duly endorsed or
shall cause the Holder thereof to have duly endorsed the Defeasance Collateral
or shall have accompanied the Defeasance Collateral by a written instrument of
transfer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Holder (including,
without limitation, such instruments as may be required by the depository
institution holding such securities or the issuer thereof, as the case may be,
to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the book-entry facilities
of such institution or issuer) in order to perfect upon the delivery of the
Defeasance Security Agreement a first priority security interest in the
Defeasance Collateral in favor of Holder in conformity with all applicable state
and federal laws governing the granting of such security interests.


                                       4

         D. Maker hereby appoints Holder as its agent and attorney-in-fact for
the purpose of using the Defeasance Deposit to purchase for the account of Maker
the Defeasance Collateral at then-prevailing market prices, using the means and
sources customarily employed and available to Holder to effectuate such
purchases. The Defeasance Collateral shall be arranged such that payments
received from such Defeasance Collateral shall be paid directly to Holder to be
applied on account of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note. Any portion of
the Defeasance Deposit in excess of the amount necessary to purchase the
Defeasance Collateral and to satisfy Maker's obligations under Section II.C
hereof shall be remitted to Maker following such purchase.

         E. Upon compliance with the requirements of Section II.C hereof, the
Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall constitute collateral which shall
secure this Note. Holder shall, at Maker's expense, execute and deliver any
documents reasonably requested by Maker to release the Property from the lien of
the Mortgage.

         F. Upon the release of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage in
accordance with Section II.E hereof, Maker shall, at the election and direction
of the Holder, assign the Defeasance Collateral and all its rights and
obligations under this Note, the other Loan Documents and under the Defeasance
Security Agreement to a successor obligor which shall be a single purpose,
bankruptcy-remote entity and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Holder (the
"Successor Maker") provided that the Successor Maker executes an assumption
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Holder (the
"Assumption Agreement") pursuant to which Successor Maker assumes Maker's
obligations under this Note, the other Loan Documents and the Defeasance
Security Agreement other than those which are described in Sections II.C(4)(e)
and (f) (the "Assumption"). Maker shall, at such time, (x) deliver to Holder an
opinion, in form and substance and by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Holder,
stating, among other things, that the Assumption Agreement is enforceable
against Maker and such Successor Maker in accordance with its terms and that,
upon the Assumption, this Note and the Defeasance Security Agreement are
enforceable against the Successor Maker in accordance with their respective
terms, and (y) pay all costs and expenses incurred by Holder or its agents in
connection with the Assumption (including, without limitation, the review of the
proposed Successor Maker and the preparation of the Assumption Agreement, legal
opinions and related documentation). Upon such Assumption, Maker shall be
relieved of its obligations hereunder, under the other Loan Documents and under
the Defeasance Security Agreement, except for those which are set forth in
Sections II.C(4)(e) and (f) hereof.

         G. Upon the release of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage in
accordance with Section II.E hereof, neither Maker nor any Successor Maker shall
have any right to prepay this Note pursuant to the other provisions of this
Section or otherwise.

                            SECTION III. DEFAULT RATE

         A. Upon the occurrence of and for so long as an Event of Default
exists, in Holder's sole discretion, Maker shall pay interest on the Principal
Amount and all such other amounts due under the Loan Documents at an annual rate
equal to the lesser of (a) the Interest Rate plus four percent (4%) and (b) the
maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the "Default Rate"), and shall be
computed from the date performance was due through the date, if any, upon which
full performance is rendered.


                                       5
<PAGE>

         B. To the extent permitted by law, interest shall continue to accrue at
the Default Rate, notwithstanding the issuance of a judgment of foreclosure and
sale, the conveyance of the Property through the exercise of a power of sale or
otherwise; it being expressly understood and agreed that Maker's obligations
hereunder shall not merge into any such judgment or conveyance and shall survive
until the actual receipt by Holder of the full amount of the Principal Amount
and any other amounts due and payable hereunder which were not paid when due.
The foregoing provisions shall not be construed as a waiver by Holder of its
right to pursue any other remedies available to it under the Mortgage or any
other Loan Document, nor shall it be construed to limit in any way the
application of the Default Rate.

                             SECTION IV. LATE CHARGE

         In addition to any interest which may be charged hereunder, Maker shall
pay to Holder a charge ("Late Charge") for the collection of late payments in an
amount equal to five percent (5.0%) of any payment required hereunder (except as
specifically set forth in this Section) which is not paid within five (5) days
after the Payment Date, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Maker agrees
that the Late Charge shall be due and payable upon all or any portion of the
Principal Amount not repaid on or before the Maturity Date. In no event shall
Holder apply the Late Charge to the Principal Amount upon the acceleration of
the Loan prior to the Maturity Date. Maker recognizes that its default in making
any payment as provided herein or in any other Loan Document as agreed to be
paid when due, or the occurrence of any other Event of Default, will require
Holder to incur additional expense in servicing and administering the Loan in
loss to Holder of the use of the money due and in frustration to Holder in
meeting its other financial and loan commitments and that the damages caused
thereby would be extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain. Nothing in
this Note shall be construed as an obligation on the part of Holder to accept,
at any time, less than the full amount then due hereunder or as a waiver or
limitation of Holder's right to compel prompt performance.

                             SECTION V. NON-RECOURSE

         A. Holder agrees that it will look solely to the Property and such
other collateral, if any, as may now or hereafter be given to secure the
repayment of the indebtedness evidenced hereby. No other property or assets of
Maker, or any partner, member or principal of Maker, shall be subject to levy,
execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of the remedies of
Holder, or for any payment required to be made under this Note or any of the
other Loan Documents or for the performance of any of the covenants or
warranties contained in the Loan Documents.

         B. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not (i) constitute a
waiver of the obligations secured by or arising under the Mortgage or the other
Loan Documents, (ii) limit the right of Holder to name Maker or the partners,
members or principals of Maker as parties in any action or suit for judicial
foreclosure and sale under the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents or with
respect to any other remedies available to Holder thereunder, so long as no
monetary judgment shall be enforced against Maker or any partner, member or

                                       6
<PAGE>

principal of Maker, except to the extent of the Property or such collateral,
(iii) release, reduce or impair this Note, the indebtedness evidenced hereby, or
the lien of the Mortgage, (iv) prevent or in any way hinder Holder from
exercising any remedy available to Holder under this Note or any of the Loan
Documents including, without limitation, the appointment of a receiver or naming
Maker or, if necessary in order to ensure the availability of Holder's remedies
as set forth in the Loan Documents, any person, entity, association or joint
venture ("Person") owning an interest in Maker in any action, suit or proceeding
in connection with the exercise of any such remedy, as long as no monetary
judgment, including a deficiency judgment, shall be enforced against any assets
of Maker or any Person owning an interest in Maker, other than the Property or
such other collateral, or (v) release or limit the liability of Maker, any
guarantor hereof or any indemnitor under the indemnity agreement dated as of the
date hereof, by Wilshire Oil Company of Texas in favor of Holder (the
"Indemnity") or the environmental indemnity dated as of the date hereof, by
Maker and Wilshire Oil Company of Texas in favor of Holder (the "Environmental
Indemnity") or affect in any way the validity or enforceability of the Indemnity
Agreement, the Environmental Indemnity or any guaranty given in connection with
this Note or any of the other Loan Documents.

         C. Notwithstanding any provision hereof or in any Loan Document to the
contrary, Maker shall be personally liable hereunder for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements), causes of action, suits, claims,
demands and judgments paid, imposed upon Holder or to which the Holder may be
subject, or any reduction in amounts recovered by Holder directly or indirectly
(including, without limitation, any diminution in value of the Property or
Holder's security interest therein) as a result of Maker, or any Affiliate,
indemnitor, guarantor, agent or employee of Maker:

                  (1)      misapplying or misappropriating any proceeds of
                           insurance policies or condemnation awards in
                           connection with the Property;

                  (2)      misapplying (under any lease, the Mortgage or any
                           other agreement) or misappropriating any Rents,
                           security deposits or other refundable deposits paid
                           to or held by or on behalf of Holder;

                  (3)      receiving any Rent or other payments under Leases
                           more than one month in advance;

                  (4)      committing waste, arson or damage to the Property as
                           a result of intentional misconduct or gross
                           negligence;

                  (5)      removing any Equipment or other Property in violation
                           of the Mortgage or other Loan Documents;

                  (6)      failing to fully comply with Article XIII of the
                           Mortgage and any other provision of the Loan
                           Documents relating to hazardous or toxic substances
                           or compliance with environmental laws and
                           regulations;


                                       7
<PAGE>

                  (7)      committing fraud or making any material
                           misrepresentation in connection with the Loan or the
                           ownership, use, operation or management of the
                           Property;

                  (8)      transferring or encumbering the Property in violation
                           of Article VIII of the Mortgage; or

                  (9)      failing to maintain the existence of Maker as a
                           Special-Purpose Entity or otherwise failing to comply
                           with Article XII of the Mortgage.

         D. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right
of Holder under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, or any successor thereto, or similar
provisions under applicable state law to file a claim for the full amount of the
indebtedness owing to Holder in accordance with this Note and the other Loan
Documents.

                              SECTION VI. REMEDIES

         A. So long as an Event of Default exists, at the option of Holder, the
following amounts shall become immediately due and payable: (1) the entire
Principal Amount, all accrued interest thereon and all other fees, charges and
sums due and payable hereunder, (2) all costs and expenses in connection with
the enforcement of Holder's rights hereunder, and (3) a prepayment charge (the
"Prepayment Charge") equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the Principal Amount or
(b) the positive difference, if any, between (x) the present value on the date
of such acceleration of all future installments which Maker would otherwise be
required to pay under this Note during the original term hereof absent such
acceleration, including the unpaid Principal Amount which might otherwise be due
upon the scheduled Maturity Date absent such acceleration, with such present
value being determined by the use of a discount rate equal to the yield to
maturity (adjusted to a "Mortgage Equivalent Basis" pursuant to the standards
and practices of the Securities Industry Association), on the date of such
acceleration, of the United States Treasury Security having the term to maturity
closest to what otherwise would have been the remaining term hereof absent such
acceleration, and (y) the Principal Amount on the date of such acceleration.
Failure of Holder to require any of these payments shall not constitute a waiver
of the right to require the same in the event of any subsequent default or to
exercise any other remedy available to Holder hereunder, under any other Loan
Document or at law or in equity.

         B. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Holder is intended to
be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies available to Holder under this
Note, any other Loan Document or at law or in equity, and each and every such
remedy shall be cumulative and exercisable in any order and as many times as
Holder deems expedient.

         C. Maker agrees to pay all costs and expenses of collection incurred by
Holder hereunder including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
pursuit by Holder of any of its rights or remedies hereunder, under the Mortgage
or any of the other Loan Documents, whether involving the preservation of
Property, protection of the lien of the Mortgage, suit on this Note,
participation in any foreclosure proceeding, any out-of-court workout or
settlement or any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or other proceedings
affecting creditors' rights and involving a claim under this Note or any other
Loan Document. All such costs and expenses shall be payable on demand with
interest thereon to be calculated at the Default Rate and shall be secured by
the Mortgage and other Loan Documents.

<PAGE>

                           SECTION VII. SAVINGS CLAUSE

         This Note is subject to the express condition that at no time shall
Maker be obligated or required to pay interest on the Principal Amount at a rate
which could subject Holder to either civil or criminal liability as a result of
being in excess of the maximum interest rate which Maker is permitted by
applicable law to contract or agree to pay. If, by the terms of this Note, Maker
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the Principal Amount at
a rate in excess of such maximum rate, the rate of interest shall be deemed to
be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and the interest payable shall be
computed at such maximum rate and all previous payments in excess of such
maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of the principal
and not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be
paid to Holder for the use, forbearance, or detention of the Principal Amount
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread throughout the full stated term of this Note until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Principal
Amount does not exceed the applicable maximum lawful rate of interest from time
to time in effect. This provision shall supersede any inconsistent provision of
this Note or any other Loan Document. Maker agrees to an effective rate of
interest that is the rate stated above plus any additional rate of interest
resulting from any other charges in the nature of interest paid or to be paid by
or on behalf of Maker, or any benefit received or to be received by Holder, in
connection with this Note.

                           SECTION VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

         A. Note Secured. This Note is secured by the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents.

         B. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Note shall
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid or
unenforceable under the applicable law of any jurisdiction with respect to any
Person or circumstance, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition, invalidity or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provisions in any other jurisdiction or with respect to other Persons or
circumstances. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto
hereby waive any provision of law that renders any provision hereof prohibited,
invalid or unenforceable in any respect.

         C. Waivers. Maker hereby waives valuation and appraisement,
presentment, protest and demand, notice of protest, demand and dishonor and
nonpayment, notice on intent to accelerate the maturity hereof and notice of
acceleration of this Note. To the extent permitted by law, Maker hereby
expressly waives the right to receive any notice from Holder with respect to any
matter for which the Loan Documents do not expressly provide for the giving of
notice by Holder to Maker.


                                       9

         D. Agent for Service. Maker does hereby designate and appoint Sheldon
E. Jaffe having an address c/o Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer, 90 Woodbridge Center
Drive, Suite 900, Box 10, Woodbridge, New Jersey, 07095, as its authorized agent
to accept and acknowledge on its behalf service of any and all process which may
be served in any suit, action or proceeding in any federal or state court in
Arizona, and agrees that service of process upon said agent at said address and
written notice of said service of Maker mailed or delivered to Maker in the
manner provided in the Mortgage shall be deemed in every respect effective
service of process upon Maker in any such suit, action or proceeding in the
State of Arizona. Maker shall give prompt notice to Holder of any changed
address of its authorized agent hereunder, may at any time and from time to time
designate a substitute authorized agent with an office in Arizona (which office
shall be designated as the address for service of process), and shall promptly
designate such a substitute if its authorized agent ceases to have an office in
Arizona or is dissolved without leaving a successor. No notice of change of
designated agent by Maker or of such agent's address shall be or be deemed
effective until thirty (30) days following Holder's receipt thereof.

         E. Participation. Holder shall have the right, without notice to or
consent of Maker, (i) to sell, assign or otherwise transfer this Note and all of
the other Loan Documents in connection with the Loan, or any of its interest
therein and (ii) to transfer, assign or sell participations and
subparticipations in this Note; provided, however, that no transfer or
participation shall increase the obligations of Maker or otherwise adversely
affect the rights and obligations of Maker and Holder hereunder or under any
other Loan Documents.

         F. Use of Proceeds. Maker certifies that all of the Loan proceeds will
be used exclusively for business or commercial purposes and not for any
personal, family, household, agricultural or consumer purpose.

         G. Liability. If Maker consists of more than one Person, the
obligations and liabilities of each such Person hereunder shall be joint and
several.

         H. No Oral Modifications. This Note cannot be modified orally, but only
by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any
modification is sought.

         I. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. MAKER AND HOLDER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, EACH HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY, WITH AND UPON THE
ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL, WAIVES, RELINQUISHES AND FOREVER FORGOES HEREBY THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY TORT ACTION, BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE,
THE LOAN OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, ACT, OMISSION, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PERSON (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, SUCH PERSON'S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH PERSON), IN
CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN OR THIS NOTE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN ANY
COUNTERCLAIM WHICH MAKER MAY BE PERMITTED TO ASSERT HEREUNDER OR WHICH MAY BE
ASSERTED BY HOLDER OR ITS AGENTS AGAINST MAKER, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE. THIS WAIVER BY MAKER OF ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR HOLDER TO MAKE THE LOAN.


                                       10
<PAGE>

         J. No Waivers by Holder. The failure of Holder to insist upon strict
performance of any term hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the
obligations of Maker or any of the rights or remedies of Holder hereunder.
Holder may waive any Event of Default or performance of Maker without waiving
any other Event of Default or performance of Maker. Holder may remedy any Event
of Default without waiving the Event of Default remedied. No delay in
performance of any right or remedy of Holder shall be construed as a waiver of
such right or remedy. Acceptance of any payment after the occurrence of an Event
of Default shall not be deemed to waive or cure such Event of Default.
Acceptance by Holder of any partial payment or partial performance by Maker
shall not be deemed a waiver of full payment or full performance. No extension
of time for the payment of any amounts due under this Note made by agreement
with any Person now or hereafter liable for the payment of this Note shall
operate to release, discharge, modify, change or affect the original liability
of Maker hereunder, either in whole or in part, unless Holder agrees otherwise
in writing.

         K. Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses. Maker hereby knowingly waives
the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any
action or proceeding brought against it by Holder. Any assignee of this Note or
any successor of Holder shall take this Note free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to this Note which Maker may
otherwise have against any assignor of this Note. No such unrelated counterclaim
or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Maker in any action or proceeding
brought by any such assignee upon this Note. Any such right to interpose or
assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action or
proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Maker.

         L. Time of the Essence. Time shall be of the essence in the performance
of all obligations of Maker hereunder.

         M. Successors. All references herein to Maker and to Holder shall be
deemed to include their respective heirs, executors, legal representatives,
successors and assigns. Nothing in this Note, whether express or implied, shall
be construed to give any Person (other than Holder) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Note or any covenants or
provisions contained herein.

         N. Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State where the Property is located.
