                            HERSHEY FOODS CORPORATION

                          Broad Based Stock Option Plan

                  (Amended and Restated as of August 19, 2002)

         1.  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

         The purpose of the Broad Based Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to
provide to participating employees of Hershey Foods Corporation (the
"Corporation") and its subsidiaries (as defined below), upon whose efforts the
Corporation is dependent for the successful conduct of its business, an
incentive to continue and increase their efforts as employees and to remain in
the employ of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. To accomplish this purpose,
the Corporation's Board of Directors ("Board") has authorized the Compensation
and Executive Organization Committee of the Board (the "Committee") to grant,
from time to time in its sole discretion and in accordance with the Plan,
options ("Options") to purchase shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $1.00
par value (the "Common Stock").

         2.  STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

         The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be
granted pursuant to this Plan is two million (2,000,000), subject to adjustment
in accordance with Paragraph 11 below. The shares of Common Stock issued upon
exercise of Options granted under this Plan may be either authorized but
unissued shares, treasury shares held by the Corporation or any direct or
indirect subsidiary thereof, or shares acquired by the Corporation through open
market purchases (whether made before or after the exercise of the Options) or
otherwise. In addition to the shares of Common Stock actually issued or
distributed upon exercise of Options granted under the Plan, there shall be
deemed to have been issued a number of shares equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock in respect of which optionees utilize the manner of exercise of,
and payment for, Options as provided in Paragraph 5(e)(iii) of the Plan. If, for
any reason, any Option granted under the Plan expires or terminates or is
forfeited or surrendered, the number of shares of Common Stock for which such
Option was granted shall be disregarded in determining whether the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be granted has been
reached.

         3.  ADMINISTRATION

         The Plan shall be administered by the Committee or any successor
committee appointed by the Board. The Committee may adopt such rules and
regulations as it deems useful in governing its affairs. Any action of the
Committee with respect to the administration of the Plan shall be taken by
majority vote at a Committee meeting or written consent of all Committee
members.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: (i) to construe and interpret Plan provisions; (ii) to define
the terms used in the Plan; (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan; (iv) to determine the terms,



<PAGE>


conditions,  form and amount of grants, including conditions upon and provisions
for vesting,  exercise and acceleration of any grants; and (v) to make all other
determinations  necessary or advisable for the  administration  and operation of
the  Plan.  The  Committee  shall  have the right to  impose  varying  terms and
conditions  with  respect  to  each  grant  or  award.  All  determinations  and
interpretations  made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on
all Participants and on their legal representatives and beneficiaries.

         Any dispute or disagreement which shall arise under, as a result of, or
in any way relate to the interpretation, construction or administration of the
Plan or the Options granted hereunder shall be determined in all cases by the
procedures established by the Plan, as amended or supplemented by the Committee.
All disputes or disagreements shall be initially submitted to the Vice President
of Human Resources of the Corporation for resolution. The Participant or his
legal representative or beneficiary will submit to the Vice President of Human
Resources a summary of the dispute and all materials supporting his or her
position on the matter. The Corporation will also submit materials to support
its position on the matter. The Vice President of Human Resources shall render a
decision in writing within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the submissions by
both parties. Participant or the Corporation may appeal the decision of the Vice
President of Human Resources to the Committee, but such appeal must be submitted
to the Committee within fifteen (15) calendar days of the decision by the Vice
President of Human Resources. The Committee will review the material submitted
by the parties to the Vice President of Human Resources and any additional
material the parties may wish to submit to support their position. The Committee
will render its decision in writing by the later of forty-five (45) calendar
days of its receipt of the submissions by both parties or the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Committee following the receipt of the submissions. The
decision by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes.

         4.  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

         With regard to the initial grant of Options under the Plan to be made
by the Committee at its January 7, 1997 meeting (the "Initial Grant"), the
following employees are eligible to participate in the Plan: (i) employees of
the Corporation; (ii) employees of any U.S., Canadian, or Mexican wholly-owned
subsidiary, and employees of Hershey Japan Company, Ltd, a subsidiary of Hershey
International Ltd., Hershey Corporation ZAO, a subsidiary of Hershey Holding
Corporation, and employees of the Corporation's representative offices in Russia
and China (each called a "Subsidiary Corporation" and collectively called the
"Subsidiary Corporations"), provided they were full-time employees of the
Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation on December 3, 1996. Full-time employees
who were on paid or unpaid leave of absence, layoff, or disability on December
3, 1996 are eligible to participate in the Initial Grant provided they performed
at least one hour of work for the Corporation during 1996. In addition to the
employees described in the first two sentences of this Paragraph 4, an employee
of the Corporation on December 3, 1996 shall be eligible for participation in
the Initial Grant if such individual performed at least one hour of work for the
Corporation, or any Subsidiary Corporation, as an employee in 1996 and in five
(5) of the six (6) years 1990 through 1995. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Paragraph 4, no individual who (i) as of December 3, 1996 was a
temporary employee (as defined in the Corporation's Human Resources Policy
Manual) of the Corporation; (ii) as of December 3, 1996 was a leased employee
(as hereinafter defined); or (iii) on January 7, 1997 is eligible to receive a
stock option grant under


                                       2
<PAGE>


the  Corporation's  Key Employee  Incentive  Plan ("KEIP") shall be eligible for
participation in the Initial Grant. For purposes of the Initial Grant, a "leased
employee"  shall  be  defined  as  an  employee  of an  entity  other  than  the
Corporation,  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation,  who  performs  services  for the
Corporation,  or any Subsidiary Corporation,  on a short- or long-term basis and
who,  in the  performance  of such  services,  may (but  need  not) be under the
primary direction or control of the Corporation,  or any Subsidiary Corporation.
Persons who would  otherwise be classified as "leased  employees"  under Section
414(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any successor provision,  shall,
without limitation of the immediately preceding sentence and for purposes of the
Initial Grant, be deemed "leased employees."

         In the event that the Committee elects, in its sole discretion, to
grant Options at any time following the Initial Grant, it shall prescribe
eligibility criteria for each such grant at the time of the grant, provided
however, that in each such case, temporary employees, leased employees, and
employees who on the date of the grant are eligible to receive stock options
under the Corporation's KEIP shall not be eligible to participate in the grant.

         Any employee meeting the eligibility criteria established pursuant to
this Paragraph 4 for the Initial Grant or any subsequent grant, or the estate of
such employee if deceased, shall, for the purposes of such grant, be hereinafter
referred to as a "Participant."

         5.  TERMS OF GRANT

         The Initial Grant and any other option grants which may be made by the
Committee shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as
such additional consistent terms and conditions as the Committee may establish
at the time of such grant:

             (a) The exercise  price per share with respect to each Option shall
be  determined by the  Committee in its sole  discretion,  but shall not be less
than 100% of the Fair  Market  Value of the  Common  Stock as of the date of the
grant  of the  Option.  As  used in the  Plan  (unless  a  different  method  of
calculation is required by applicable law, and except as otherwise  specifically
provided in any Plan provision),  "Fair Market Value" on or as of any date shall
mean (i) the closing price of the Common Stock as reported in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite  Transactions Report (or any other consolidated  transactions
reporting  system which  subsequently  may replace such  Composite  Transactions
Report) for the New York Stock Exchange  trading day immediately  preceding such
date, or if there are no sales on such date, on the next  preceding day on which
there were sales, or (ii) in the event that the Common Stock is no longer listed
for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,  an amount  determined in accordance
with  standards  adopted by the  Committee.

             (b) Options  granted under the Plan shall be  exercisable for such
periods as shall be provided by the Committee at the time of granting, but in no
event shall any Option  granted  extend for a period in excess of ten (10) years
from the date of grant.

             (c) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no Option granted
hereunder  may be  exercised  during the first five (5) years  after the date of
grant by the Committee.


                                      3
<PAGE>


             (d) Exercise of an Option shall be accomplished in the form
and manner established by the Committee.

             (e) The purchase price upon exercise of any Option shall be paid in
full by the Participant to the Corporation by making payment either (i) in cash,
or (ii) in a simultaneous  exercise of the Option and sale of the shares thereby
acquired  pursuant  to a  brokerage  arrangement  approved  in  advance  by  the
Committee to assure its conformity with the terms and conditions of the Plan, or
(iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

         6.  VESTING

             (a) All Options granted under this Plan shall have a five (5) year
vesting  requirement  and  shall be  subject  to such  other  vesting  terms and
conditions as the  Committee  shall  prescribe in the grant.  With regard to the
Initial Grant a  Participant  must (i) perform at least one hour of work for the
Corporation  or a Subsidiary  Corporation  during each of the years 1997 through
2001 and (ii) be a  full-time  or  part-time  employee of the  Corporation  or a
Subsidiary  Corporation or a Chocolate  World Flex Force Employee (as defined in
the Human  Resources  Policy Manual) on January 6, 2002 in order to satisfy this
vesting  requirement.  Participants  who retire under a  retirement  plan of the
Corporation  or  terminate  employment  after  attaining  age  55  ("retire"  or
"retirement"),  die or become  disabled on or after December 4, 1996, but before
the close of business on January 6, 2002,  shall not forfeit their Options under
the Initial  Grant,  but shall maintain such rights in the Options to the extent
set forth in Paragraph 7(b) below.

             (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of the terms
and  conditions  of any grant of Options  hereunder,  upon the  occurrence  of a
Change in Control,  each  outstanding and unexpired Option held by a Participant
who is an employee  of the  Corporation  or any  Subsidiary  Corporation  or who
retired,  died or became  disabled  while  employed  by the  Corporation  or any
Subsidiary Corporation shall become fully vested and exercisable notwithstanding
any vesting schedule or installment  schedule relating to the  exercisability of
such Option established at the time of the grant of the Option.

             (c) For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" means:

                (1)  Individuals  who, on December 3, 1996, constitute the Board
          (the  "Incumbent  Directors")  cease for any reason to  constitute  at
          least a majority  of the Board,  provided  that any person  becoming a
          director  subsequent to December 3, 1996, whose election or nomination
          for  election  was  approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
          Incumbent  Directors  then on the Board (either by specific vote or by
          approval  of the proxy  statement  of the  Corporation  in which  such
          person is named as nominee for director,  without written objection to
          such nomination) shall be an Incumbent  Director;  provided,  however,
          that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
          Corporation  as a result of an actual or threatened  election  contest
          (as  described  in Rule  14a-11  under the  Exchange  Act)  ("Election
          Contest") or other  actual or  threatened  solicitation  of proxies or
          consents  by or on behalf of any  person  (as such term is  defined in
          Section  3(a)(9) of the Exchange  Act and as used in Section  13(d)(3)
          and  14(d)(2) of the  Exchange  Act)  ("Person")  other than the Board
          ("Proxy Contest"), including by


                                       4
<PAGE>


          reason  of any  agreement  intended  to avoid or settle  any  Election
          Contest or Proxy Contest,  shall be deemed an Incumbent Director;  and
          provided  further,  however,  that a director who has been approved by
          the  Hershey  Trust  while it  beneficially  owns more than 50% of the
          combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the
          Corporation  entitled to vote  generally  in the election of directors
          (the "Outstanding  Corporation Voting Power") shall be deemed to be an
          Incumbent Director; or

                (2)  The acquisition or holding by any Person of beneficial
          ownership  (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act
          and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of shares of the
          Common  Stock  and/or  the  Class B Common  Stock  of the  Corporation
          representing  25% or  more of  either  (i) the  total  number  of then
          outstanding  shares of both Common  Stock and Class B Common  Stock of
          the  Corporation  (the  "Outstanding  Corporation  Stock") or (ii) the
          Outstanding  Corporation  Voting Power;  provided that, at the time of
          such  acquisition  or  holding  of  beneficial  ownership  of any such
          shares,  the Hershey Trust does not  beneficially own more than 50% of
          the Outstanding Corporation Voting Power; and provided,  further, that
          any such  acquisition or holding of beneficial  ownership of shares of
          either Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the  Corporation by any
          of the following entities shall not by itself constitute such a Change
          in  Control   hereunder:   (i)  the  Hershey  Trust;  (ii)  any  trust
          established by the  Corporation or by any Subsidiary  Corporation  for
          the  benefit of the  Corporation  and/or its  employees  or those of a
          Subsidiary  Corporation  or by  any  Subsidiary  Corporation  for  the
          benefit  of  the  Corporation  and/or  its  employees  or  those  of a
          Subsidiary  Corporation;  (iii) any employee  benefit plan (or related
          trust)  sponsored or maintained by the  Corporation  or any Subsidiary
          Corporation;  (iv) the Corporation or any Subsidiary  Corporation;  or
          (v) any  underwriter  temporarily  holding  securities  pursuant to an
          offering of such securities; or

                (3)  The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of any
          merger, reorganization,  recapitalization, consolidation or other form
          of business  combination  (a  "Business  Combination")  if,  following
          consummation of such Business Combination,  the Hershey Trust does not
          beneficially  own  more  than  50% of the  total  voting  power of all
          outstanding  voting securities of (x) the surviving entity or entities
          (the  "Surviving  Corporation")  or (y) if  applicable,  the  ultimate
          parent   corporation   that  directly  or  indirectly  has  beneficial
          ownership  of more than 50% of the  combined  voting power of the then
          outstanding  voting  securities  eligible  to elect  directors  of the
          Surviving Corporation; or

                (4)  The approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of (i)
          any  sale or  other  disposition  of all or  substantially  all of the
          assets of the Corporation, other than to a corporation (the "Acquiring
          Corporation")  if,  following  consummation  of  such  sale  or  other
          disposition,  the Hershey Trust beneficially owns more than 50% of the
          total voting power of all outstanding  voting  securities  eligible to
          elect directors (x) of the Acquiring Corporation or (y) if applicable,
          the  ultimate  parent  corporation  that  directly or  indirectly  has
          beneficial  ownership of more than 50% of the combined voting power of
          the then outstanding voting securities  eligible to elect directors of
          the Acquiring Corporation, or (ii) a liquidation or dissolution of the
          Company.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Hershey Trust" means either or both of (a)
the Hershey Trust Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, as Trustee for the Milton
Hershey School, or any successor to the Hershey Trust Company as such trustee,
and (b) the Milton Hershey School, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation.

             (d) For purposes of this Plan, a "Potential Change in Control"
means:

                (1)  The Hershey Trust by action of any of the Board of
          Directors of Hershey  Trust  Company;  the Board of Managers of Milton

          including,  but not limited to  consideration  of (i) an offer made to
          the  Hershey  Trust  to  purchase  any  number  of its  shares  in the
          Corporation  such that if the Hershey  Trust  accepted  such offer and
          sold such number of shares in the  Corporation the Hershey Trust would
          no longer  have more than 50% of the  Outstanding  Corporation  Voting
          Power,  (ii) an  offering  by the  Hershey  Trust of any number of its
          shares  in the  Corporation  for  sale  such  that if such  sale  were
          consummated  the  Hershey  Trust would no longer have more than 50% of
          the Outstanding  Corporation  Voting Power, or (iii) entering into any
          agreement or understanding  with a person or entity that would lead to
          a Change in Control; or

                (2)  The Board  approves a transaction  described in subsection
          (2), (3) or (4) of the definition of a Change in Control  contained in
          subparagraph (c) of Paragraph 6 hereof.

             (e) In the event that a transaction which would constitute a Change
in Control if approved by the stockholders of the Corporation is to be submitted
to such stockholders for their approval, each Participant who is an employee and
who holds an Option  granted under the Plan at the time scheduled for the taking
of such vote, whether or not then exercisable, shall have the right to receive a
notice at least ten (10)  business  days prior to the date on which such vote is
to be  taken.  Such  notice  shall  set  forth  the date on which  such  vote of
stockholders is to be taken, a description of the transaction  being proposed to
stockholders for such approval,  a description of the provisions of subparagraph
(b) of Paragraph 6 of the Plan and a description  of the impact  thereof on such
Participant in the event that such stockholder approval is obtained. Such notice
shall  also set forth the  manner in which and price at which all  Options  then
held by each such  Participant  could be  exercised  upon the  obtaining of such
stockholder approval.

         7.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

         Upon termination of the employment with the Corporation of any
Participant, such Participant's rights with respect to any Options granted under
this Plan shall be as follows:

             (a) In the  event that the  participant is terminated or discharged
by the  Corporation  for  any  reason,  except  as to and  the  extent  provided
otherwise  by the  Committee  in writing and except as provided  below after the
occurrence of a Change in Control,  the


                                       6
<PAGE>


participant's  rights and interests under the Plan shall  immediately  terminate
upon notice of termination of employment.

         Upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control and for a period
of one (1) year thereafter, the following special provision and notice
requirement shall be applicable in the event of the termination of the
employment of any participant holding an Option under the Plan: (i) in no event
may a notice of termination of employment be issued to such a participant unless
at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of such termination,
the participant is provided with a written notice of intent to terminate the
participant's employment which sets forth in reasonable detail the reason for
such intent to terminate, the date on which such termination is to be effective,
and a description of the participant's rights under this Plan and under the
agreements granting such Option or Options, including the fact that no such
Option may be exercised after such termination has become effective and the
manner, extent and price at which all Options then held by such participant may
be exercised; and (ii) such notice of intent to terminate a participant's
employment shall not be considered a "notice of termination of employment" for
purposes of the first sentence of this Paragraph 7(a). This Paragraph 7(a) is
intended only to provide for a requirement of notice to terminate upon the
occurrence of the events set forth herein and shall not be construed to create
an obligation of continued employment or a contract of employment in any manner
or to otherwise affect or limit the Corporation's ability to terminate the
employment of any participant holding an Option under the Plan.

         Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and for a period of two (2)
years thereafter, in the event of the termination of a participant's employment
by the Corporation for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below) or by
the participant for Good Reason (as defined below), such participant shall have
one (1) year from the date of termination of employment to exercise such Option
or until the date of expiration of the Option, if earlier. In addition, all
restrictions and limitations on the exercise of such Option or the sale of
shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option relating to
minimum stockholding requirements shall immediately terminate upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Cause" means, with respect to a participant
who is covered under the Hershey Foods Corporation Employee Benefits Protection
Plan (Group 2), the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan
(Group 3), or the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits Protection Plan
(Group 3A), "cause" as defined in the plan applicable to such participant, and
with respect to all other participants, means (a) the willful and continued
failure of an employee to substantially perform the employee's duties with the
Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to
physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance
is delivered to the employee by the employee's supervisor which specifically
identifies the manner in which the employee's supervisor believes that the
employee has not substantially performed the employee's duties; or (b) the
willful engaging by the employee in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is
materially and demonstrably injurious to the Corporation. For purposes of the
preceding clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on the part of the
employee, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by the employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
employee's action or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or with the approval of a
senior officer of the Corporation or the employee's superior or based upon the
advice


                                       7
<PAGE>


of counsel for the  Corporation  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done,  by the employee in good faith and in the best  interests of
the Corporation.

         For purposes of this Plan, "Good Reason" means, with respect to a
participant who is covered under the Hershey Foods Corporation Employee Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 2), the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 3), or the Hershey Foods Corporation Executive Benefits
Protection Plan (Group 3A), "good reason" as defined therein, and with respect
to all other participants, means "good reason" as defined in the Hershey Foods
Corporation Amended and Restated Severance Benefits Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Change in Control.

             (b) If a Participant's employment with the Corporation terminates
as a result of his or her becoming  disabled (in which event termination will be
deemed to occur on the date of such determination), or as a result of retirement
or death, Participant or his or her estate shall continue to be a Participant in
the  Plan  and  may,  for a  period  of up to five  (5)  years  from the date of
disability, death or retirement,  exercise such Options pursuant to the terms of
this Plan. With regard to the Initial Grant,  any Participant  whose  employment
with the  Corporation  terminates in a manner  described in this  Paragraph 7(b)
during the period  beginning  December  4,  1996,  and ending  with the close of
business on January 31,  1997,  shall have the right to exercise  Options  which
have  vested  under the Plan  until the close of  trading  on the New York Stock
Exchange  on January 31,  2002.  Any  provision  of this  Paragraph  7(b) to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  no Option  granted  pursuant  to this Plan  shall be
capable of being  exercised  prior to its  becoming  vested,  or  following  its
expiration date.

             (c) In the event that a Participant resigns from employment with
the  Corporation,  the  Participant's  rights and interests under the Plan shall
immediately  terminate  upon  such  resignation;  provided,  however,  that  the
Committee  shall  have  the  absolute  discretion  to  review  the  reasons  and
circumstances of the resignation and to determine whether, alternatively, and to
what  extent,  if any,  the  Participant  may  continue  to hold any  rights  or
interests under the Plan.

             (d) A transfer of a Participant's employment without an intervening
period from the  Corporation to a Subsidiary  Corporation or vice versa, or from
one  Subsidiary  Corporation  to another,  shall not be deemed a termination  of
employment.   A  Participant's   transfer  to  a  non-participating   Subsidiary
Corporation shall also not be deemed a termination of employment for purposes of
this  section.  The  sale of a  participating  or  non-participating  Subsidiary
Corporation  shall,  unless  the  Committee  determines  otherwise,  be deemed a
termination  of the  Participant's  employment  under  paragraph  7(c) above and
employees of such  subsidiary  shall no longer be deemed eligible to participate
in the Plan and must  exercise  their  Options  (if  vested)  prior to the sale.
Options  which  are not  vested  at the  time of sale  will be  terminated.  Any
provision of this Paragraph 7(d) to the contrary  notwithstanding,  with respect
to the  Initial  Grant,  any  Participant  who,  on the  date  of the  sale of a
participating or non-participating  Subsidiary Corporation, has attained the age
of 55,  died or become  disabled  while  employed by the  Corporation,  shall be
deemed to have terminated their employment pursuant to Paragraph 7(b), and shall
continue to be Participants under the Plan in accordance with that paragraph.

             (e) The Committee shall be authorized to make all determinations
and  calculations  required by this  Paragraph 7,  including any  determinations
necessary to establish the reason for terminations of employment for purposes of
the Plan, which  determinations and calculations shall be conclusive and binding
on any affected Participants and estates.

         8.  Additional Requirements

         No Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall be exercisable or
realized in whole or in part, and the Corporation shall not be obligated to
sell, distribute or issue any shares subject to any such Option, if such
exercise and/or sale would, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation,
violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or other federal or state
statutes, or foreign statutes having similar requirements), or exceed daily
volume limitations imposed by the Corporation from time to time on sales of
Common Stock. Each Option shall be subject to the further requirement that, if
at any time the Committee shall determine in its discretion that the listing or
qualification of the shares relating or subject to such Option under any
securities exchange requirements or under any applicable law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option or the
distribution or the issue of shares thereunder, such Option may not be exercised
in whole or in part unless such listing, qualification, consent or approval
shall have been effected or obtained free of any condition not acceptable to the
Board.

         A Participant's interest in Options granted under this Plan may be
subject to restrictions or other special rules as to grant, exercise, resale or
other disposition and to such other provisions as may be appropriate to comply
with federal, state and/or foreign securities and other applicable laws and
stock exchange requirements, and the grant or exercise of any Option or
entitlement to payment thereunder may be contingent upon receipt from the
Participant (or any other person permitted by this Plan to exercise any Option
or receive any distribution hereunder) of a representation that at the time of
such exercise it is his or her then present intention to acquire the shares
being distributed for investment and not for resale.

         9.  NONTRANSFERABILITY

         Options granted under this Plan to a Participant shall be nonassignable
and shall not be transferable by him or her otherwise than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the employee's
lifetime, only by the employee or the employee's guardian or legal
representative.

         10. DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

         No provision in the Plan or any Options granted pursuant to the Plan
shall be construed to confer upon the Participant any right to be employed by
the Corporation or by any Subsidiary Corporation, or to interfere in any way
with the right and authority of the Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation
either to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant at any time,
or to terminate any relationship of employment between the Participant and the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiary Corporations.


                                       9
<PAGE>



         Participants under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a
stockholder of the Corporation with respect to shares subject to Options, unless
and until such shares have been issued to him or her.

         11. STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

         In the event that the shares of Common Stock, as presently constituted,
shall be changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of
stock or other securities of the Corporation or of another corporation (whether
by reason of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
split, combination of shares or otherwise), or if the number of such shares of
Common Stock shall be increased through the payment of a stock dividend, or a
dividend on the shares of Common Stock of rights or warrants to purchase
securities of the Corporation shall be made, then there shall be substituted for
or added to each share available under and subject to the Plan as provided in
Paragraph 2 hereof, and each share theretofore appropriated or thereafter
subject or which may become subject to Options, under the Plan, the number and
kind of shares of stock or other securities into which each outstanding share of
Common Stock shall be so changed or for which each such share shall be exchanged
or to which each such share shall be entitled, as the case may be. Outstanding
options also shall be appropriately amended as to price and other terms as may
be necessary to reflect the foregoing events. In the event there shall be any
other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or
of any stock or other securities into which the Common Stock shall have been
changed or for which it shall have been exchanged, then if the Board shall, in
its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment
in the shares available under and subject to the Plan, or in any Options granted
under the Plan, such adjustments shall be made in accordance with such
determination.

         No fractional shares of Common Stock or units of other securities shall
be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any
such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the
nearest whole share or unit.

         12. TAXES

         The Corporation shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
attributable to any amounts payable or shares of Common Stock deliverable under
the Plan. The person entitled to any such delivery upon the exercise of an
Option may, by notice to the Corporation, elect to have such withholding
satisfied by a reduction of the number of shares otherwise so deliverable, or by
delivery of shares of stock already owned by the Participant, with the amount of
shares subject to such reduction or delivery to be calculated based on the Fair
Market Value of such shares on the date of such taxable event.

         13. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

         The Plan shall become effective upon adoption by the Board. The Board
at any time may terminate the Plan, but such termination shall not alter or
impair any of the rights or obligations under any grant of Options theretofore
made under the Plan unless the affected Participant shall so consent.


                                       10

         14. APPLICATION OF FUNDS

         The proceeds received by the Corporation from the sale of capital stock
pursuant to Options will be used for general corporate purposes.

         15. NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTION

         The granting of an Option shall impose no obligation upon the
Participant to exercise such Option.

         16. AMENDMENT

         The Board, by majority vote at any time and from time to time, may
amend the Plan in such respects as it shall deem advisable, to conform to any
change in any applicable law or in any other respect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Broad Based Stock
Option Plan to be amended and restated as of the 19th day of August, 2002.
