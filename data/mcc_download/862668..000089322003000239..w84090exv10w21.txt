FOR VALUE RECEIVED, ESCALON MEDICAL CORP, (the "Borrower"), with an address at
351 E. Conestoga Road, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087, jointly and severally promise
to pay to the order of PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (the "Bank"), in lawful
money of the United States of America in immediately available funds at its
offices located at 1600 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, or at
such other location as the Bank may designate from time to time, the principal
sum of TWO MILLION DOLLARS ($2,000,000) (the "Facility") or such lesser amount
as may be advanced to or for the benefit of the Borrower hereunder, together
with interest accruing on the outstanding principal balance from the date
hereof, as provided below:

         1.       RATE OF INTEREST. Amounts outstanding under this Note will
                  bear interest as set forth in the Letter Agreement referred to
                  in Section 6 hereof.

         2.       ADVANCE PROCEDURES. A request for advance made by telephone
                  must be promptly confirmed in writing by such method as the
                  Bank may require. The Borrower authorizes the Bank to accept
                  telephonic requests for advances, and the Bank shall be
                  entitled to rely upon the authority of the Chief Executive
                  Officer, the Senior Vice President of Finance and the
                  Corporate Controller of the Borrower in providing such
                  instructions. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds the
                  Bank harmless from and against any and all damages, losses,
                  liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees and expenses) which may arise or be created by
                  the acceptance of such telephone requests or making such
                  advances. The Bank will enter on its books and records, which
                  entry when made will be

                  presumed correct, the date and amount of each advance, as well
                  as the date and amount of each payment made by the Borrower.

         3.       PAYMENT TERMS. Accrued interest will be due and payable on the
                  first day of each month, beginning with the payment due on the
                  first day of the month following the date hereof. The
                  outstanding principal balance and any accrued but unpaid
                  interest shall be due and payable on the Expiration Date (as
                  defined in the Letter Agreement).

If any payment under this Note shall become due on a Saturday, Sunday or public
holiday under the laws of the State where the Bank's office indicated above is
located, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day and such
extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with
such payment. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Bank to charge the Borrower's
deposit account at the Bank for any payment when due hereunder. Payments
received will be applied to charges, fees and expenses (including attorneys'
fees), accrued interest and principal in any order the Bank may choose, in its
sole discretion.

         4.       LATE PAYMENTS; DEFAULT RATE. If the Borrower fails to make any
                  payment of principal, interest or other amount coming due
                  pursuant to the provisions of this Note within 15 calendar
                  days of the date due and payable, the Borrower also shall pay
                  to the Bank a late charge equal to the lesser of five percent
                  (5%) of the amount of such payment or $100. Such 15 day period
                  shall not be construed in any way to extend the due date of
                  any such payment. The late charge is imposed for the purpose
                  of defraying the Bank's expenses incident to the handling of
                  delinquent payments and is in addition to, and not in lieu of,
                  the exercise by the Bank of any rights and remedies hereunder,
                  under the other Loan Documents or under applicable laws, and
                  any fees and expenses of any agents or attorneys which the
                  Bank may employ. Upon maturity, whether by acceleration,
                  demand or otherwise, and at the option of the Bank upon the
                  occurrence of any Event of Default (as hereinafter defined)
                  and during the continuance thereof, this Note shall bear
                  interest at a rate per annum (based on a year of 360 days and
                  actual days elapsed) which shall be four (4) percentage points
                  in excess of the interest rate in effect from time to time
                  under this Note but not more than the maximum rate allowed by
                  law (the "Default Rate"). The Default Rate shall continue to
                  apply whether or not judgment shall be entered on this Note.

         5.       PREPAYMENT. The indebtedness evidenced by this Note may be
                  prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty.

         6.       OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Note is issued in connection with a
                  Letter Agreement (as amended,

                  Guaranty and Suretyship Agreements previously executed by the

                  property described in the Loan Documents (if any) and by such
                  other collateral as previously may have been or may in the
                  future be granted to the Bank to secure this Note.

         7.       EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following
                  events will be deemed to be an "Event of Default" under this
                  note: (i) the nonpayment of any principal, interest or other
                  indebtedness under this Note when due; (ii) the occurrence of
                  any event of default or default and the lapse of any notice or

                  the Bank shall not be obligated to advance additional funds
                  during such period); (iv) any assignment by any Obligor for
                  the benefit of creditors, or any levy, garnishment, attachment

                  of such default is to cause or permit the acceleration of such
                  debt; (vi) the commencement of any foreclosure or forfeiture

                  representation or warranty made by any Obligor to the Bank in
                  any Loan Document, or any other documents now or in the future
                  securing the obligations of any Obligor to the Bank, is false,

                  failure of any Obligor to observe or perform any covenant or

principal balance and accrued interest hereunder together with any additional
amounts payable hereunder, at the option of the Bank and without demand or
notice of any kind, may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable;
(d) at the option of the Bank, this Note will bear interest at the Default Rate
from the date of the occurrence of the Event of Default; and (e) the Bank may
exercise from time to time any of the rights and remedies available to the Bank
under the Loan Documents or under applicable law.

         8.       POWER TO CONFESS JUDGMENT. THE BORROWER HEREBY EMPOWERS ANY
                  ATTORNEY OF ANY COURT OF RECORD, AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY
                  EVENT OF DEFAULT HEREUNDER, TO APPEAR FOR THE BORROWER AND,

                  FOR DOING SO THIS NOTE OR A COPY VERIFIED BY AFFIDAVIT SHALL
                  BE A SUFFICIENT WARRANT THE BORROWER HEREBY FOREVER WAIVES AND
                  RELEASES ALL RIGHTS OF APPEAL AND ALL RELIEF FROM ANY AND ALL
                  APPRAISEMENT, STAY OR EXEMPTION LAWS OF ANY STATE NOW IN FORCE

                  ACCRUE AT THE DEFAULT RATE.

NO SINGLE EXERCISE OF THE FOREGOING POWER TO CONFESS JUDGMENT, OR A SERIES OF
JUDGMENTS, SHALL BE DEEMED TO EXHAUST THE POWER, WHETHER OR NOT ANY SUCH
EXERCISE SHALL BE HELD BY ANY COURT TO BE INVALID, VOIDABLE, OR VOID, BUT THE
POWER SHALL CONTINUE UNDIMINISHED AND IT MAY BE EXERCISED FROM TIME TO TIME AS
OFTEN AS THE BANK SHALL ELECT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE BANK SHALL HAVE RECEIVED
PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBT, INTEREST AND COSTS.

         9.       RIGHT OF SETOFF. In addition to all liens upon and rights of
                  setoff against the money, securities or other property of the
                  Borrower given to the Bank by law, the Bank shall have, with
                  respect to the Borrower's obligations to the Bank under this
                  Note and to the extent permitted by law, a contractual
                  possessory security interest in and a contractual right of
                  setoff against, and the Borrower hereby assigns, conveys,
                  delivers, pledges and transfers to the Bank all of the
                  Borrower's right, title and interest in and to, all deposits,
                  moneys, securities and other property of the Borrower now or
                  hereafter in the possession of or on deposit with, or in
                  transit to, the Bank whether held in a general or special
                  account or deposit, whether held jointly with someone else, or
                  whether held for safekeeping or otherwise, excluding, however,
                  all IRA, Keogh, and trust accounts. Every such security
                  interest and right of setoff may be exercised without demand
                  upon or notice to the Borrower. Every such right of setoff
                  shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the
                  occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder without any action
                  of the Bank, although the Bank may enter such setoff on its
                  books and records at a later time.

         10.      MISCELLANEOUS. No delay or omission of the Bank to exercise
                  any right or power arising hereunder shall impair any such
                  right or power or be considered to be a waiver of any such
                  right or power, nor shall the Bank's action or inaction impair
                  any such right or power. The Borrower agrees to pay on demand,
                  to the extent permitted by law, all costs and expenses
                  incurred by the Bank in the enforcement of its rights in this
                  Note and in any security therefor, including without
                  limitation reasonable fees and expenses of the Bank's counsel.
                  If any provision of this Note is found to be invalid by a
                  court, all the other provisions of this Note will remain in
                  full force and effect. The Borrower and all other makers and
                  endorsers of this Note hereby forever waive presentment,
                  protest, notice of dishonor and notice of nonpayment.

collateral. If this Note is executed by more than one Borrower, the obligations
of such persons or

assigns.

nationally recognized overnight courier service directed to the Borrower at the

within any other county, state or other foreign or domestic jurisdiction. The
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the venue provided above is the most
