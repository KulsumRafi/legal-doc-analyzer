         The foregoing items of property listed in Sections 2.01(a) and (b),
together with the rights of the Indenture Trustee under the Policy, are
collectively referred to as the "TRUST PROPERTY". In addition, on or prior to
the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Insurer to deliver the Policy to
the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders.

         It is the intention of the Seller and the Issuer that the assignment
and transfer herein contemplated constitute (and shall be construed and treated
for all purposes as) a true and complete sale of the Trust Property (other than
the Spread Account and the Policy), conveying good title thereto free and clear
of any liens and encumbrances, from the Seller to the Issuer. However, in the
event that such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge to secure a loan (in spite
of the express intent of the parties hereto that this conveyance constitutes,
and shall be construed and treated for all purposes, as a true and complete
sale), the Seller hereby grants to the Issuer, for the benefit of the
Noteholders and the Insurer, a first priority perfected security interest in all
of the Seller's right, title and interest in the Trust Property whether now
existing or hereafter created and all proceeds of the foregoing to secure the
loan deemed to be made in connection with such pledge and, in such event, this
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.

                  (c)      The sale and assignment of the Prefunded Contracts
         and the other property and rights related thereto described in Section
         2.01(b) shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
         conditions, as well as the conditions set forth in Section 4.08, as of
         the related Prefunding Transfer Date, as applicable:

                  (i)               the Seller shall have delivered to the
                                    Custodian, on behalf of the Issuer, the
                                    Prefunded Contracts, and the Seller shall
                                    have delivered to the Issuer, the Indenture
                                    Trustee and the Insurer, on the Business Day
                                    immediately preceding the related Prefunding
                                    Transfer Date, a duly executed Transfer
                                    Certificate, substantially in the form of
                                    Exhibit C-1;

                  (ii)              the Servicer and the Seller shall certify to
                                    the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer that,
                                    as of the Prefunding Transfer Date, the
                                    Servicer and the Seller, respectively, were
                                    not insolvent nor were they made insolvent
                                    by such transfer nor were they aware of any
                                    such pending insolvency;

                  (iii)             the Seller shall certify to the Indenture
                                    Trustee and the Insurer that the addition of
                                    such Prefunded Contracts will not result in
                                    a material adverse tax consequence to the
                                    Issuer or the Noteholders;

                  (iv)              the Funding Period shall not have
                                    terminated;

                  (v)               the Seller and the Servicer shall certify to
                                    the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer that
                                    no selection procedures believed by the
                                    Seller or the Servicer to be adverse to the
                                    interests of the Noteholders or the Insurer
                                    shall have been utilized in selecting the
                                    Prefunded Contracts;

                  (vi)              the Seller and the Insurer shall not have
                                    been advised by either Rating Agency on or
                                    before the Business Day immediately
                                    preceding such Prefunding Transfer Date that
                                    the conveyance of the Prefunded Contracts
                                    would result in a qualification,
                                    modification or withdrawal of its then
                                    current rating of the Notes without regard
                                    to the Policy;

         right, title and interest of the Seller in and to the Trust Property,
         receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the Issuer. Concurrently
         with such delivery and in exchange therefor, the Issuer has pledged to
         the

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
         Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Insurer,
         the Trust Property and the Indenture Trustee, pursuant to the written
         instructions of the Issuer, has executed and caused to be authenticated
         and delivered the Notes to the Seller or its designee, upon the order
         of the Issuer.

                  (e)      In connection with the sale of the Contracts pursuant
         to the Purchase Agreement, Onyx filed with the office of the Secretary
         of State of the State of Delaware a UCC-1 financing statement naming
         Onyx as debtor, naming the Seller as secured party and including the
         Contracts in the description of the collateral, such filing made in
         order to continue the effectiveness of a financing statement naming
         Onyx as debtor and the Seller as secured party filed with the office of
         the Secretary of State of the State of California prior to July 1,
         2001. In connection with the sale of the Contracts pursuant to this
         Agreement, the Seller has filed or caused to be filed with the
         Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a UCC-1 financing statement
         naming the Seller as debtor, naming the Issuer as secured party, naming
         the Indenture Trustee, on behalf of the Noteholders, as assignee, and
         including the Contracts in the description of the collateral. In
         connection with the pledge of the Contracts pursuant to the Indenture,
         the Trust has filed with the offices of the Secretary of State of the
         State of Delaware UCC-1 financing statements naming the Trust as debtor
         and the Indenture Trustee, on behalf of the Noteholders and the
         Insurer, as secured party. The grant of a security interest to the
         Indenture Trustee and the rights of the Indenture Trustee in the
         Contracts shall be governed by the Indenture.

         The Seller shall have caused UCC-3 partial releases to have been filed
with the office of Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to
any outstanding security interests in the Contracts.

                  (f)      From time to time, the Servicer shall cause to be
         taken such actions as are necessary to continue the perfection of the
         respective interests of the Trust and the Indenture Trustee in the
         Contracts and to continue the first priority security interest of the
         Indenture Trustee in the Financed Vehicles and their proceeds (other
         than, as to such priority, any statutory lien arising by operation of
         law after the Closing Date which is prior to such interest), including,
         without limitation, the filing of financing statements, amendments
         thereto or continuation statements and the making of notations on
         records or documents of title.

                  (g)      If any change in the name, identity or corporate
         structure of the Seller or Onyx or the relocation of the state of
         organization of either of them would make any financing or continuation
         statement or notice of lien filed under this Agreement or the other
         Basic Documents misleading within the meaning of applicable provisions
         of the UCC or any title statute, the Insurer must have been provided
         prior written consent to such change and the Servicer, within the time
         period required by applicable law, shall file such financing statements
         or amendments as may be required to preserve and protect the interests
         of the Trust, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Insurer in
         the Contracts, the related Financed Vehicles and the proceeds thereof.
         Promptly thereafter, the Servicer shall deliver to the Trust, the
         Indenture Trustee and the Insurer an Opinion of Counsel stating that,
         in the opinion of such counsel, all financing statements or amendments
         necessary fully to preserve and protect the interests of the Trust, the

                                      -25-

         Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Insurer in the Contracts,
         the related Financed Vehicles and the proceeds thereof have been filed,
         and reciting the details of such filings.

                  (h)      During the term of this Agreement, the Seller and
         Onyx shall each continue to be an organization organized under the laws
         of one of the states of the United States.

                  (i)      The Servicer shall pay all reasonable costs and
         disbursements in connection with the perfection and the maintenance of
         perfection, as against all third parties, of the Indenture Trustee's
         right, title and interest in and to the Contracts and in connection
         with maintaining the first priority security interest (subject to the
         security interest of the Insurer pursuant to the Insurance Agreement)
         in the Financed Vehicles and the proceeds thereof.

                  (j)      On the Prefunding Closing Date, the Seller shall:

                                    with its terms, except only as such
                                    enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,

                                    amendment or modification has caused such

                                    business, and no adverse selection

                  (xx)              As of the related Prefunding Cut-Off Date,

                                    not more than 72 months, and as of the

                  (xxiv)            The Obligor on such Contract is either (a) a
                                    natural person residing in any state or (b)
                                    another entity, provided that a natural

                                    transferred to the Issuer as of any

                                    in any one state.

                  (e)      None of the foregoing representations and warranties
         shall be construed as, and the Seller is specifically not making, any
         representations and warranties regarding the collectibility of the
         Contracts or the future performance of the Contracts.

                  (f)      The Seller has not prepared any financial statement
         which accounts for the transfer of the Trust Property (other than the
         Policy and the Spread Account) hereunder to the Issuer in any manner
         other than as a sale of the Trust Property (other than the Policy and
         the Spread Account) by it to the Issuer, and the Seller has not in any
         other non-income tax respect (including, but not limited to, for
         accounting purposes) accounted for or treated the transfer of the Trust
         Property (other than the Policy and the Spread Account) hereunder in
         any manner other than as a sale and absolute assignment to the

                                      -37-
<PAGE>
         Issuer of the Seller's full right, title and ownership interest in the
         Trust Property (other than the Policy and the Spread Account) to the
         Issuer.

                  SECTION 2.03      REPURCHASE OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS.

         The representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in Section
2.02 with respect to each Contract and each of the conditions set forth in
Section 2.01(c) with respect to each transfer of Prefunded Contracts and Section
2.01(j) with respect to the Prefunding Closing Date and sale of Prefunded
Contracts shall survive delivery of the Contract Documents and shall continue
until the termination of this Agreement. Upon discovery by the Seller, the
Servicer, the Insurer or a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Trust Agent that any of such representations and
warranties was incorrect or that any of such conditions was unsatisfied as of
the time made or that any of the Contract Documents relating to any such
Contract has not been properly executed by the Obligor or contains a material
defect or has not been received by the Custodian, such Person making such
discovery shall give prompt notice to the other such Persons. If any such
defect, incorrectness or omission materially and adversely affects the interest
of the Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer or the Insurer, the Seller
shall cure the defect or eliminate or otherwise cure the circumstances or
condition in respect of which such representation or warranty was incorrect as
of the time made; provided that if the Seller is unable to do so by the last day
of the Collection Period following the Collection Period (or, if the Seller
elects, the last day of such Collection Period) during which the Seller becomes
aware of or receives written notice from the Servicer, the Insurer or the
Indenture Trustee of such defect, incorrectness or omission, it shall repurchase
such Contract on the last day of the applicable Collection Period from the
Issuer at the Purchase Amount. Upon any such repurchase, the Issuer shall
execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller any Contract
purchased hereunder. The sole remedy of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders with respect to a breach of the Seller's representations and
warranties pursuant to Section 2.02 shall be to require the Seller to repurchase
Contracts pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that the Seller shall
indemnify the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the
Insurer, the Issuer and the Noteholders against all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as a result of
third-party claims arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such
breach.

                  SECTION 2.04      CUSTODY OF CONTRACT FILES.

                  (a)      Duties of Custodian. The Custodian shall:

                                    facilities in accordance with customary
                                    standards for such custody. Such Contract
                                    Documents shall not be segregated to show
                                    the Issuer as owner thereof and the
                                    Indenture Trustee as the pledgee thereof,
                                    unless the Insurer requires such
                                    segregation.

                  (ii)              with respect to the Contract Documents, (A)

                                    benefit of the Indenture Trustee and (B)
                                    hold all

                                    Contract Documents for the exclusive use
                                    (notwithstanding Sections 2.04(a)(iii) and
                                    2.04(a)(iv) below) and for the benefit of
                                    the Indenture Trustee.

                  (iii)             in the event that the Servicer is not the
                                    Custodian, to the extent the Servicer
                                    directs the Custodian in writing, deliver
                                    certain specified Contract Documents to the
                                    Servicer to enable the Servicer to service
                                    the Contracts pursuant to this Agreement. At
                                    such time as the Servicer returns such
                                    Contract Documents to the Custodian, the
                                    Servicer shall provide written notice of
                                    such return to the Custodian. The Custodian
                                    shall acknowledge receipt of the returned
                                    materials by signing the Servicer's notice
                                    and shall promptly send copies of such
                                    acknowledgment or receipt to the Servicer.

                  (iv)              upon reasonable prior written notice, permit
                                    the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the
                                    Insurer to examine the Contract Documents in
                                    the possession, or under the control, of the
                                    Custodian.

                  (v)               at its own expense, maintain at all times
                                    while acting as Custodian, and keep in full
                                    force and effect (A) fidelity insurance, (B)
                                    theft of documents insurance, (C) fire
                                    insurance, and (d) forgery insurance. All
                                    such insurance shall be in amounts, with
                                    standard coverage and subject to
                                    deductibles, as are customary for similar
                                    insurance typically maintained by banks that
                                    act as custodian in similar transactions.

                  (b)      Appointment of Custodian. As of the Closing Date,
         Onyx shall be the Custodian of the Contract Documents; provided,
         however, that (i) the Indenture Trustee (if the Notes have not been
         paid in full and the Indenture has not been satisfied and discharged)
         and the Issuer, with the consent of the Insurer, or (ii) the Insurer,
         may terminate such appointment at any time, with or without cause by
         written notice to the Custodian, and upon the execution by the
         Indenture Trustee at the direction of the Insurer (or, if the Notes
         have been paid in full and the Indenture has been satisfied and
         discharged, the Issuer at the direction of the Insurer) of a letter
         agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the
         "Appointment of Custodian"), revocably appointing such other entity
         acceptable to the Insurer as agent of and bailee for the Indenture
         Trustee (or, if applicable, the Trust) to act as Custodian (the
         "Successor Custodian") of the Contract Documents, such Successor
         Custodian shall be so appointed and shall from the effective date of
         such Appointment of Custodian retain custody of the Contract Documents
         and any and all other documents relating to a Contract or the related
         Obligor or Financed Vehicle. As of the effective date of such
         Appointment of Custodian, the Contract Documents and any and all other
         documents relating to a Contract or the related Obligor or Financed
         Vehicle will be delivered to the Successor Custodian in its capacity as
         agent of and bailee for the Indenture Trustee (or, if applicable, the
         Trust).

         For so long as the Servicer is the Custodian of the Contract Documents,
the Servicer need not maintain the Contract Documents held by it in a file area
physically separate from the other installment sales contracts or loans owned or
serviced by it or any of its Affiliates, unless the Insurer requires such
segregation.

                  SECTION 2.05      DUTIES OF SERVICER RELATING TO THE
CONTRACTS.

                  (a)      Safekeeping. The Servicer, in its capacity as
         servicer, shall hold the Contract Files and any Contract Documents held
         by it in accordance with this Agreement on behalf of the Issuer, the
         Indenture Trustee and the Insurer for the use and benefit of all
         present and future Noteholders, and maintain such accurate and complete
         accounts, records and computer systems pertaining to each Contract File
         as shall enable the Issuer to comply with this Agreement. In performing
         its duties as servicer, the Servicer shall act with reasonable care,
         using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises
         with respect to the files relating to all comparable automobile
         contracts that the Servicer owns or services for itself or others. The
         Servicer shall (i) conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic physical
         inspections of the Contract Files (and the Contract Documents, if the
         Servicer is acting as Custodian) held by it under this Agreement and of
         the related accounts, records and computer systems; (ii) maintain the
         Contract Files (and the Contract Documents, if the Servicer is acting
         as Custodian) in such a manner as shall enable the Issuer, the
         Indenture Trustee and the Insurer to verify the accuracy of the
         Servicer's record keeping; (iii) promptly report to the Issuer, the
         Indenture Trustee and the Insurer any failure on its part to hold the
         Contract Files (and the Contract Documents, if the Servicer is acting
         as Custodian) and maintain its accounts, records and computer systems
         as herein provided and (iv) promptly take appropriate action to remedy
         any such failure.

                  (b)      Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Servicer
         shall maintain each Contract File (other than the Contract Documents,
         unless the Servicer is acting as Custodian) at the address of the
         Servicer set forth in Section 9.04, or, upon the prior written consent
         of the Insurer, at such other location as shall be specified to the
         Issuer and the Indenture Trustee by 30 days' prior written notice. The
         Servicer shall permit the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer
         or their respective duly authorized representatives, attorneys or
         auditors to inspect the Contract Files and the related accounts,
         records and computer systems maintained by the Servicer at such times
         as such Persons may request.

                  (c)      Release of Documents. If the Servicer is acting as
         Custodian pursuant to Section 2.04, upon instruction from the Indenture
         Trustee and prior written consent of the Insurer (a copy of which shall
         be furnished to the Issuer), the Servicer shall release any document in
         the Contract Files to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee's
         agent, or the Indenture Trustee's designee, as the case may be, at such
         place or places as the Indenture Trustee may designate, as soon as
         practicable.

                  (d)      Monthly Reports. On the Servicer Report Date of each
         month, commencing with the month next succeeding the month of the
         Closing Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Indenture
         Trustee and the Insurer a certificate of a

                                      -40-
<PAGE>
         Servicing Officer stating (i) the Contract Number and outstanding
         principal balance of each Contract that has become a Liquidated
         Contract since the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the
         last certificate delivered pursuant to this subsection (or since the
         Closing Date in the case of the first such certificate); (ii) that, if
         such Contract has been the subject of a Full Prepayment pursuant to
         clause (a) of the definition of the term "Full Prepayment" or is a
         Liquidated Contract pursuant to clause (iii) of the definition of the
         term "Liquidated Contract," all proceeds received in respect thereof
         have been deposited in or credited to the Collection Account in
         accordance with Section 4.02; (iii) that, if such Contract has been the
         subject of a Full Prepayment pursuant to clause (b) of the definition
         of the term "Full Prepayment," the correct Purchase Amount has been
         deposited in or credited to the Collection Account in accordance with
         Section 2.03, 3.07 or 4.02; (iv) that, if such Contract is a Liquidated
         Contract pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition of the term
         "Liquidated Contract," there have been deposited in or credited to the
         Collection Account the related Net Liquidation Proceeds in accordance
         with Section 4.02; and (v) that the Indenture Trustee is authorized to
         release such Contract and the related Contract Documents as provided
         herein.

                  (e)      Schedule of Title Documents. The Servicer shall
         deliver to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Insurer (i) within
         60 days of the Closing Date with respect to the Funded Contracts and
         within 60 days of the Prefunding Closing Date with respect to the
         Prefunded Contracts, a schedule of Title Documents for Financed
         Vehicles which, as of the Closing Date or the Prefunding Closing Date,
         as applicable, did not show Onyx as first lienholder and (ii) within
         180 days of the Closing Date with respect to the Funded Contracts and
         within 180 days of the Prefunding Closing Date with respect to the
         Prefunded Contracts, a schedule of Title Documents for Financed

                  (f)      Electronic Marking of Contracts; Possession. The
         Servicer shall cause the electronic record of the Contracts maintained
         by it to be clearly marked to indicate that the Contracts have been
         sold to the Issuer and shall not in any way assert or claim an
         ownership interest in the Contracts. It is intended that pursuant to
         the applicable provisions of Sections 2.04 and 2.05 hereof and the
         Appointment of Custodian, the Custodian on behalf of the Indenture
         Trustee and the Insurer shall be deemed to have possession of the
         Contract Documents for purposes of Section 9-305 of the UCC of the
         state in which the Contract Documents are located.

                  SECTION 2.06      INSTRUCTIONS; AUTHORITY TO ACT.

         With respect to any servicing and administration matter not otherwise
addressed in this Agreement, the Servicer shall be deemed to have received

respect to the Contract Files upon its receipt of written instructions signed by
a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee and the written consent of the
Insurer.

                                      -41-
<PAGE>
                  SECTION 2.07      INDEMNIFICATION.

         Subject to Section 7.02, the Servicer shall indemnify the Issuer, the
Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer, the
Custodian and the Noteholders for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
compensatory damages, payments, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent,
the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer, the Custodian or the Noteholders as the
result of any improper act or omission in any way relating to the maintenance
and custody by the Servicer of the Contract Files, or the failure of the
Servicer to perform its duties and service the Contracts in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be
liable to the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the
Custodian or the Insurer for any portion of any such amount resulting from the
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Owner Trustee, the Trust
Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Custodian or the Insurer, respectively. The
Servicer shall also indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Trust Property,
the Noteholders, the Custodian, the Indenture Trustee, the Trust Agent, the
Owner Trustee and the Insurer against any taxes that may be asserted at any time
against any of them with respect to the Contracts, including any sales, gross
receipts, general corporation, personal property, privilege or license taxes
(but exclusive of federal or other income taxes arising out of payments on the
Contracts) and the costs and expenses in defending against such taxes. The
Servicer shall (i) immediately notify the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Insurer if a claim is made by a third party with respect to the Contracts, (ii)
assume, with the consent of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer,
the defense of any such claim, (iii) pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including counsel fees, and (iv) promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against the Servicer, the Issuer, the
Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer, the
Custodian or the Noteholders with respect to such Contracts.

                  SECTION 2.08      EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION.

         The appointment of Onyx as custodian shall become effective as of the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier of
(i) the execution of the Appointment of Custodian or (ii) the Class A-4 Final
Scheduled Distribution Date. If Onyx shall subsequently resign as Servicer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or if all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 7.01,
the appointment of the Servicer as Custodian may be terminated by the Insurer,
or if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, by Holders evidencing
not less than 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, acting
together as a single Class, or by the Indenture Trustee. As soon as practicable
after any termination of such appointment, Onyx as Custodian and Onyx as
Servicer shall, at the Servicer's expense, deliver or cause the delivery of all
Contract Documents and all Contract Files (including those held in microfiche or
electronic form) to the Indenture Trustee or its agent (or, if the Indenture has
been satisfied and discharged, as directed by the Trust, with the consent of the
Insurer) at such place or places as the applicable party may reasonably
designate and shall cooperate in good faith to effect such delivery. The
foregoing notwithstanding, if the Servicer is acting as Custodian, the Servicer
shall, at the request of the Insurer, deliver the Contract Documents to the
Indenture Trustee in the event that such delivery is required by any Rating
Agency to consider the Notes investment grade without consideration of the
Policy.

                  SECTION 2.09      NONPETITION COVENANT.

                  (a)      Neither the Seller nor the Servicer shall petition or
         otherwise invoke the process of any court or government authority for
         the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Issuer under
         any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or
         appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian,
         sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or any substantial
         part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the
         affairs of the Issuer.

                  (b)      The Servicer shall not, nor cause the Seller to,
         petition or otherwise invoke the process of any court or government
         authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against
         the Seller under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
         law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian,
         sequestrator or other similar official of the Seller or any substantial
         part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the
         affairs of the Seller.

                  SECTION 2.10      COLLECTING TITLE DOCUMENTS NOT DELIVERED AT
THE CLOSING DATE.

         In the case of any Funded Contract or Prefunded Contract in respect of
which, in place of a Title Document, the Custodian received on the Closing Date
or the Prefunding Closing Date, as applicable, written evidence from the Dealer
selling the related Financed Vehicle that, or otherwise in respect of which, the
Title Document for such Financed Vehicle showing Onyx as first lienholder has
been applied for from the Registrar of Titles, the Servicer shall use its best
efforts to collect (or to obtain evidence in the electronic title records of)
such Title Document from the Registrar of Titles as promptly as possible. If
such Title Document showing Onyx as first lienholder is not received by the
Servicer (or verified by the Servicer in the electronic title records) within
180 days after the Closing Date with respect to the Funded Contracts or within
180 days after the Prefunding Closing Date with respect to the Prefunded
Contracts, then the representation and warranty in Section 2.02(b)(iii) as to
any such Funded Contracts or the representation and warranty in Section
2.02(d)(iii) as to any such Prefunded Contracts in respect of such Contract
shall be deemed to have been incorrect in a manner that materially and adversely
affects the Noteholders, and the Seller shall be obligated to repurchase such
Contract in accordance with Section 2.03.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF CONTRACTS

                  SECTION 3.01      DUTIES OF SERVICER.

         The Servicer shall manage, service, administer, and make collections on
the Contracts. The Servicer agrees that its servicing of the Contracts shall be
carried out in accordance with reasonable care and, to the extent more exacting,
the procedures used by the Servicer in respect of such contracts serviced by it
for its own account; provided, however, that, subject to Section 3.02 as to
extensions, the Servicer shall not release or waive the right to collect the
unpaid balance of any Contract. The Servicer's duties shall include collection
and posting of all

                                      -43-

payments, responding to inquiries of Obligors on the Contracts, investigating
delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting tax information to
Obligors, accounting for collections, furnishing monthly and annual statements
to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Insurer with respect to
distributions and the preparation of U.S. Partnership Tax Returns (Form 1065)
for the Owner Trustee to sign and file on an annual basis, based on a tax year
for the Issuer that is the calendar year and any other tax forms required by any
federal, state or local tax authority including with respect to original issue
discount, if any. The Servicer shall have, subject to the terms hereof, full
power and authority, acting alone, and subject only to the specific requirements
and prohibitions of this Agreement, to do any and all things in connection with
such managing, servicing, administration, and collection that it may deem
necessary or desirable; provided, however, that the Servicer shall commence
repossession efforts in respect of any Financed Vehicle when any payment on the
related Contract of which is four or more months delinquent. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Indenture Trustee and
the Issuer to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the Issuer, the Insurer,
the Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee or any of them, any and all instruments
of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial or full release or discharge, and
all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Contracts or to the
Financed Vehicles. The Issuer shall furnish the Servicer any documents necessary
or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties hereunder. The Servicer may engage agents and subservicers
to fulfill its duties hereunder; provided, however, that the Servicer shall
remain at all times personally liable for the acts (and failures to act) of such
agents and subservicers.

         On or prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the
Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer a list of
Servicing Officers of the Servicer involved in, or responsible for, the
administration and servicing of the Contracts, which list shall from time to
time be updated by the Servicer on request of the Owner Trustee, the Trust
Agent, the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer.

         On the Closing Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the Collection
Account (i) all installments of Monthly P&I due on or after the Initial Cut-Off
Date and received by the Servicer at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) the proceeds of each Full Prepayment of any Contract and all
partial prepayments on Simple Interest Contracts received by the Servicer on or
after the Initial Cut-Off Date and at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds
received with respect to a Financed Vehicle to which an Initial Contract relates
received on or after the Initial Cut-Off Date and at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

         On each Prefunding Transfer Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the
Collection Account (i) all installments of Monthly P&I due on or after the
related Prefunding Cut-Off Date and received by the Servicer at least two
Business Days prior to such Prefunding Transfer Date; (ii) the proceeds of each
Full Prepayment of any Prefunded Contract and all partial prepayments on Simple
Interest Contracts received by the Servicer on or after the related Prefunding
Cut-Off Date and at least two Business Days prior to such Prefunding Transfer
Date; and (iii) all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds received
with respect to a Financed Vehicle to which a Prefunded Contract being
transferred on such date relates, received on or after the

                                      -44-
<PAGE>
related Prefunding Cut-Off Date and at least two Business Days prior to such
Prefunding Transfer Date.

         Subject to Section 4.02(a) respecting deposits in the Payahead Account,
the Servicer shall deposit in or credit to the Collection Account within two
Business Days of receipt all collections of Monthly P&I due on or after the
related Cut-Off Date received by it on the Contracts together with the proceeds
of all Full Prepayments on all Contracts and all partial prepayments on Simple
Interest Contracts, and any accompanying interest. The Servicer shall likewise
deposit in the Collection Account within two Business Days of receipt all Net
Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds. As of the last day of each
Collection Period, all amounts received in each Collection Period shall be
applied by the Servicer with respect to each Contract, first, to the Servicer as
additional servicing compensation any amounts due for late fees, extension fees
or similar charges, second to the payment of Monthly P&I, and third, in the case
of partial prepayments on Precomputed Contracts, to the Payahead Account. The
foregoing requirements for deposit in the Collection Account are exclusive, it
being understood that collections in the nature of late payment charges or
extension fees may, but need not, be deposited in the Collection Account and may
be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing compensation.

         With respect to payments of Monthly P&I made by Obligors to the
Servicer's lock box, the Servicer shall direct the Person maintaining the lock
box to deposit the amount collected on the Contracts within one Business Day to
the Clearing Account. Such amounts shall be withdrawn from the Clearing Account
and deposited in the Collection Account no later than the next following
Business Day.

         In order to facilitate the servicing of the Contracts by the Servicer,
the Servicer shall retain, subject to and only to the extent permitted by the
provisions of this Agreement, all collections on the Contracts prior to the time
they are remitted or credited, in accordance with such provisions, to the
Collection Account or the Payahead Account, as the case may be. The Servicer
acknowledges that the unremitted collections on the Contracts are part of the
Trust Property and the Servicer agrees to act as custodian and bailee of the
Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Insurer in holding such monies and
collections. The Servicer agrees, for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee, the
Issuer, the Noteholders and the Insurer, to act as such custodian and bailee,
and to hold and deal with such monies and such collections, as custodian and
bailee for the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Insurer, in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.

         The Servicer shall retain all data (including, without limitation,
computerized title records) relating directly to or maintained in connection
with the servicing of the Contracts at the address of the Servicer set forth in
Section 9.04 or, upon 15 days' notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee
and the prior written consent of the Insurer, at such other place where the
servicing offices of the Servicer are located, and shall give the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Insurer access to all data (including, without
limitation, computerized title records) at all reasonable times, and, while a
Servicer Default shall be continuing, the Servicer shall, on demand of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer, as the case may be, all data
(including, without limitation, computerized title records and, to the extent
transferable, related operating software)

                                      -45-
<PAGE>
necessary for the servicing of the Contracts and all monies collected by it and
required to be deposited in or credited to the Collection Account or the
Payahead Account, as the case may be.

         All deposits made by the Servicer in any Trust Account shall be made in
immediately available funds.

         The Servicer shall be responsible for the payment of the fees of the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Trust Agent; provided that any such
fees not paid as of a Distribution Date shall be paid as provided in Section
4.03(ii).

                  SECTION 3.02      COLLECTION OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts to collect all payments called
for under the terms and provisions of the Contracts as and when the same shall
become due and shall use its best efforts to cause each Obligor to make all
payments in respect of his or her Contract to the Servicer. Consistent with the
foregoing, the Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late payment charges
in connection with delinquent payments on a Contract or prepayment charges and
(ii) in order to work out a default or an impending default due to the financial
condition of an Obligor, grant up to six extensions of the Due Date of any
payment for periods of 30 days or less, such that the Maturity Date of no
Contract shall, under any circumstances, extend more than 180 days past the
originally scheduled date of the last payment on such Contract and in no event
beyond the Class A-4 Final Scheduled Distribution Date; provided, further, that
no more than two such extensions can be granted consecutively, no more than
three such extensions can be granted during any 12 month period and at least
three payments must be made between non-consecutive extensions. The Servicer
shall not extend the Maturity Date of a Contract except as provided in clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence. Except as explicitly permitted by this
paragraph, the Servicer shall not change any material term of a Contract,
including but not limited to the interest rate, the payment amounts or due
dates, or the property securing such Contract.

                  SECTION 3.03      REALIZATION UPON CONTRACTS.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts, consistent with the servicing
standard specified in Section 3.01, to repossess or otherwise convert the
ownership of the Financed Vehicle securing any Contract as to which no
satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments. In
connection with such repossession or other conversion, the Servicer shall follow
such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable and as
shall be normal and usual for prudent holders of retail installment sales
contracts and as shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, and, in
connection with the repossession of any Financed Vehicle or any contract in
default, may commence and prosecute any proceedings in respect of such Contract
in its own name or, if the Servicer deems it necessary, in the name of the
Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or on behalf of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee. The Servicer's obligations under this Section are subject to the
provision that, in the case of damage to a Financed Vehicle from an uninsured
cause, the Servicer shall not be required to expend its own funds in repairing
such motor vehicle unless it shall determine (i) that such restoration will
increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Contract, after
reimbursement to itself for such expenses and (ii) that such expenses will be
recoverable by it either as Liquidation Expenses or as expenses

                                      -46-
<PAGE>
recoverable under an applicable insurance policy or under an insurance reserve
established by the Servicer. The Servicer shall be responsible for all other
costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with any action taken in respect
of a Defaulted Contract; provided, however, that it shall be entitled to
reimbursement of such costs and expenses to the extent they constitute
Liquidation Expenses or expenses recoverable under an applicable insurance
policy. All Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds shall be
deposited directly in or credited to the Collection Account (without deposit in
any intervening account) to the extent required by Section 4.02.

                  SECTION 3.04      INSURANCE.

         The Servicer shall cause to be maintained the Blanket Insurance Policy,
and the Servicer shall cause the Indenture Trustee to be the named payee
thereunder with respect to the Contracts; provided, however, that this
obligation may be eliminated or modified in any manner (and this Agreement shall
be amended in accordance with any such elimination or modification as the
parties to the Insurance Agreement and the Rating Agencies may agree) with the
consent of the Insurer but without any requirement to obtain the consent of any
Noteholders.

                  SECTION 3.05      MAINTENANCE OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN
FINANCED VEHICLES.

         The Servicer shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain
continuous perfection and priority of the security interest created by each
Contract in the related Financed Vehicle, including but not limited to,
obtaining the execution by the related Obligor and the recording, registering,
filing, re-recording, re-registering, and refiling of all security agreements,
financing statements, continuation statements or other instruments as are
necessary to maintain the security interest granted by such Obligor under each
respective Contract. The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee each hereby authorize
the Servicer to take such steps as are necessary to re-perfect such security
interest on behalf of the Issuer in the event of the relocation of a Financed
Vehicle or for any other reason. In the event that the assignment of a Contract
to the Issuer and the subsequent pledge thereof by the Issuer to the Indenture
Trustee is insufficient, without a notation on the related Financed Vehicle's
certificate of title (or, if applicable, the electronic title record), or
without fulfilling any additional administrative requirements under the laws of
the state in which the Financed Vehicle is located, to grant to the Issuer a
perfected security interest in the related Financed Vehicle and to pledge such
perfected security interest to the Indenture Trustee, Onyx hereby agrees that
the identification of Onyx as the secured party on the certificate of title (or,
if applicable, the electronic title record) is deemed to be in its capacity as
agent of the Indenture Trustee and further agrees to hold such certificate of
title (or, if applicable, the electronic title record) as the Indenture
Trustee's agent and custodian; provided that, except as provided in Section 7.01
and the Insurance Agreement, neither the Servicer nor Onyx shall make, nor shall
the Issuer or Noteholders have the right to require that the Servicer or Onyx
make, any such notation on the related Financed Vehicles' certificate of title
(or, if applicable, the electronic title record) or fulfill any such additional
administrative requirement of the laws of the state in which a Financed Vehicle
is located.

                  SECTION 3.06      COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SERVICER.

         The Servicer hereby makes the following covenants, representations and
warranties on which (i) the Issuer is deemed to have relied in acquiring the
Contracts and (ii) the Insurer is deemed to have relied in issuing the Policy.
Such covenants, representations and warranties speak as of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date or the related Prefunding
Transfer Date, as applicable, but shall survive the sale, transfer and
assignment of the Contracts to the Issuer and the pledge thereof to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

                  (a)      The Servicer covenants as to the Contracts:

                  (i)               The Financed Vehicle securing each Contract
                                    shall not be released from the lien granted
                                    by the Contract in whole or in part, except
                                    as contemplated herein.

                  (ii)              The Servicer shall not impair the rights of
                                    the Noteholders or the Insurer in the
                                    Contracts.

                  (iii)             The Servicer shall not increase the number
                                    of payments under a Contract, nor increase
                                    the amount financed under a Contract, nor
                                    extend or forgive payments on a Contract,
                                    except as provided in Section 3.02.

                  (iv)              The Servicer may consent to the sale or
                                    transfer by an Obligor of any Financed
                                    Vehicle if the original Obligor under the
                                    related Contract remains liable under such
                                    Contract and the transferee assumes all of
                                    the Obligor's obligations thereunder and
                                    upon doing so the credit profile with
                                    respect to such Obligor will not be changed
                                    from adequate to speculative by virtue of
                                    the addition of the transferee's obligation
                                    thereunder.

                  (b)      The Servicer represents and warrants as of the
         Closing Date:

                  (i)               The Servicer (1) has been duly organized, is
                                    validly existing and in good standing as a
                                    corporation organized and existing under the
                                    laws of the State of Delaware, (2) has
                                    qualified to do business as a foreign

                                    jurisdiction where the character of its
                                    properties or the nature of its activities
                                    makes such qualification necessary, and (3)
                                    has full power, authority and legal right to
                                    own its property, to carry on its business
                                    as presently conducted, and to enter into

                                    of this Agreement are within the corporate

                                    of this Agreement, nor the consummation of
                                    the transactions herein contemplated, nor
                                    compliance with the provisions hereof, will
                                    conflict with or result in a breach of, or
                                    constitute a default under, any of the
                                    provisions of any law, governmental rule,
                                    regulation, judgment, decree or order
                                    binding on the Servicer or its properties or
                                    the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
                                    of the Servicer, or any of the provisions of
                                    any indenture, mortgage, contract or other
                                    instrument to which the Servicer is a party

                                    pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
                                    mortgage, contract or other instrument.

                  (iii)             Other than consents that have been obtained
                                    prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer is
                                    not required to obtain the consent of any
                                    other party or any consent, license,

                                    authority, bureau or agency in connection
                                    with the execution, delivery, performance,
                                    validity or enforceability of this
                                    Agreement.

                                    delivered by the Servicer and, assuming the
                                    due authorization, execution and delivery
                                    hereof by the Issuer, the Trust Agent and
                                    the Indenture Trustee, constitutes a legal,
                                    valid and binding obligation of the Servicer
                                    enforceable against the Servicer in
                                    accordance with its terms (subject to
                                    applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws
                                    and other similar laws affecting the
                                    enforcement of creditors' rights generally).

                  (v)               There are no actions, suits or proceedings
                                    pending or, to the knowledge of the
                                    Servicer, threatened against or affecting
                                    the Servicer, before or by any court,
                                    administrative agency, arbitrator or
                                    governmental body with respect to any of the
                                    transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
                                    or which will, if determined adversely to
                                    the Servicer, materially and adversely
                                    affect it or its business, assets,
                                    operations or condition, financial or
                                    otherwise, or materially and adversely
                                    affect the Servicer's ability to perform its
                                    obligations under this Agreement. The
                                    Servicer is not in default with respect to
                                    any order of any court, administrative
                                    agency, arbitrator or governmental body so
                                    as to materially and adversely affect the
                                    transactions contemplated by the
                                    above-mentioned documents.

                  (vi)              The Servicer has obtained or made all
                                    necessary consents, approvals, waivers and
                                    notifications of creditors, lessors and
                                    other nongovernmental persons, in each case,
                                    in connection with the

                                      -49-
<PAGE>
                                    execution and delivery of this Agreement,
                                    and the consummation of all the transactions
                                    herein contemplated.

                  SECTION 3.07      PURCHASE OF CONTRACTS UPON BREACH BY

offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the obligation of
the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information

                  SECTION 3.14      INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         Subject to Section 7.02, the Servicer agrees to indemnify and hold the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer,
the Custodian and the Noteholders harmless against any and all claims, losses,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs,
judgments, and any reasonable other costs, fees and expenses that the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer, the
Custodian or Noteholders may sustain because of the failure of the Servicer to
perform its duties and service the Contracts in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Servicer shall (i) immediately notify the Issuer, the
Insurer and the Indenture Trustee in writing if a claim is made by a third party
with respect to the Contracts, (ii) assume, with the consent of the Insurer, the
defense of any such claim, (iii) pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including counsel fees, and (iv) promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any

Servicer, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee,
the Insurer, the Custodian or the Noteholders.

                  (a)      The Indenture Trustee at its own expense shall

         described in Section 3.09(a) concurrently with the delivery of the
         statement described in Section 4.05 below.

                  (b)      The Indenture Trustee shall provide to any Noteholder

         in Section 3.10, or the annual audit report described in Section 3.11.
         The Indenture Trustee may require the Noteholder to pay a reasonable

         request.

                  (c)      The Indenture Trustee shall forward to the Rating
         Agencies and the Insurer the statement to Noteholders described in

                  SECTION 3.16      ACCESS TO LIST OF NOTEHOLDERS' NAMES AND
ADDRESSES.

         The Indenture Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Servicer, the Insurer and the Seller, within 15 days after receipt by the
Indenture Trustee of a written request therefor from the Servicer, the Insurer
or the Seller, a list, in such form as the Servicer, the Insurer or the Seller
may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Noteholders as of the
most recent Record Date. If three or more Noteholders, or one or more
Noteholders evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate outstanding principal
balance of the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Applicants"), apply in writing
to the Indenture Trustee, and such application states that the Applicants desire
to communicate with other Noteholders with respect to their rights hereunder or
under the Notes and such application is accompanied by a copy of the
communication that such Applicants propose to transmit, then the Indenture
Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application,
afford such Applicants access, during normal business hours, to the current list
of Noteholders. Each Noteholder, by receiving and holding a Note, agrees with
the Servicer, the Seller and the Indenture Trustee that none of the Servicer,
the Seller or the Indenture Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the
disclosure of any such information as to its name and address hereunder,
regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

                            STATEMENTS TO NOTEHOLDERS

                  SECTION 4.01      ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST ACCOUNTS.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall open,
         at a depository institution (which may be the same depository
         institution which is acting in the capacity as Indenture Trustee), the
         following accounts:

                  (i)               an account denominated "Collection Account -
                                    OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Indenture
                                    Trustee" (the "COLLECTION ACCOUNT");

                  (ii)              an account denominated "Payahead Account -
                                    OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent"
                                    (the "PAYAHEAD ACCOUNT");

                  (iii)             an account denominated "Spread Account - OT
                                    2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Indenture
                                    Trustee" (the "SPREAD ACCOUNT");

                  (iv)              an account denominated "Note Distribution
                                    Account - OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
                                    Indenture Trustee" (the "NOTE DISTRIBUTION
                                    ACCOUNT");

                  (v)               an account denominated "Prefunding Account -
                                    OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Indenture
                                    Trustee" (the "PREFUNDING ACCOUNT"); and

                                      -56-
<PAGE>
                  (vi)              an account denominated "Capitalized Interest
                                    Account - OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
                                    Indenture Trustee" (the "CAPITALIZED
                                    INTEREST ACCOUNT").

         In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall establish a trust account to
be maintained in the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee denominated
"Payment Account - OT 2003-A, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Indenture Trustee" (the
"PAYMENT ACCOUNT" and, together with the accounts described in clauses (i)
through (vi) above, the "TRUST ACCOUNTS"). The Trust Accounts shall be Eligible
Accounts (subject to the requirement that the Payment Account must be maintained
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) and relate solely to the
Notes and to the Contracts and, if applicable, the related Eligible Investments.
The location and account numbers of the Trust Accounts as of the Closing Date
are set forth on Schedule II. The Servicer shall give the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Trust Agent and the Indenture Trustee at least five Business Days'
written notice of any change in the location of any Trust Account and any
related account identification information, provided any such change may be made
only with the prior written consent of the Insurer. All amounts, financial
assets and investment property held in, deposited in or credited to, from time
to time, the Trust Accounts (other than the Payahead Account and investment
income credited to the Collection Account and the Capitalized Interest Account)
shall be part of the Trust Property and all amounts, financial assets and
investment property held in, deposited in or credited to, from time to time, the
Collection Account, the Spread Account, the Prefunding Account and the
Capitalized Interest Account shall be invested by the Indenture Trustee in
Eligible Investments pursuant to Section 4.01(c).

                  (b)      If as of the last day of a Collection Period a
         payment in an amount less than the scheduled payment of Monthly P&I has
         been made for a Precomputed Contract with respect to which amounts have
         been deposited in or credited to the Payahead Account in a preceding
         Collection Period in accordance with Sections 3.01 and 4.02(a), the
         Servicer shall withdraw from the Payahead Account and deposit into the
         Collection Account by the fifth Business Day preceding the Distribution
         Date immediately succeeding such Collection Period the amount equal to
         the difference between such scheduled payment of Monthly P&I and such
         actual payment, to the extent available from amounts deposited in or
         credited to the Payahead Account with respect to such Contract. Amounts
         on deposit in the Payahead Account shall be invested by the depository
         institution maintaining the Payahead Account upon the written direction
         of the Servicer in Eligible Investments which mature not later than the
         fifth Business Day prior to the Distribution Date to which such amounts
         relate, and any earnings on such Eligible Investments shall be payable
         to the Servicer monthly. The Payahead Account and all amounts on
         deposit therein or credited thereto shall not be considered part of the
         Trust Property.

                  (c)      All funds in the Collection Account, the Spread
         Account, the Prefunding Account and the Capitalized Interest Account
         shall be invested by the Indenture Trustee (if the Indenture Trustee
         maintains the applicable account), or on behalf of the Indenture
         Trustee by the depository institution maintaining such account, in
         Eligible Investments only upon the written direction from the Servicer
         or the Insurer, as described below. Subject to the limitations set
         forth herein, the Servicer may direct the depository institution
         maintaining the Collection Account, the Spread Account, the Prefunding

                                      -57-
<PAGE>
         Account and the Capitalized Interest Account in writing (with a copy of
         such direction to the Indenture Trustee, if the Indenture Trustee is
         not the applicable depository institution) to invest funds in the
         Collection Account, the Spread Account, the Prefunding Account and the
         Capitalized Interest Account in Eligible Investments; provided that (i)
         in the absence of such directions from the Servicer, the Insurer may so
         direct, and (ii) at any time during the continuance of a Servicer
         Default, only the Insurer, or for so long as an Insurer Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, only the Issuer, may give such
         investment directions. All such investments shall be in the name of the
         Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders. All income or
         other gain from investment of monies deposited in or credited to the
         Collection Account shall be paid by the depository institution
         maintaining the Collection Account to the Servicer monthly. All income
         or other gain from investment of monies deposited in or credited to the
         Spread Account, the Prefunding Account and the Capitalized Interest
         Account shall be deposited in or credited to such account immediately
         upon receipt, and any loss resulting from such investment shall be
         charged to such account. The maximum permissible maturities of any
         investments of funds in the Collection Account, the Spread Account and
         the Capitalized Interest Account on any date shall not be later than
         the Servicer Report Date immediately preceding the Distribution Date
         next succeeding the date of such investment; provided, however, that if
         the Indenture Trustee is maintaining the applicable account, such funds
         may be invested by the Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments of the
         entity that is serving as Indenture Trustee (or an entity which meets
         the criteria in clauses (i)(b) or (i)(c) of the definition of Eligible
         Account) that mature on the Business Day prior to such Distribution
         Date. The maximum permissible maturity of any investments of funds in
         the Prefunding Account on any date shall not be later than the next
         Business Day. No investment in Eligible Investments may be sold prior
         to its maturity. The funds on deposit in the Payment Account and the
         Note Distribution Account shall remain uninvested.

                  (d)      In the absence of written direction as provided
         above, all funds held in the Spread Account, the Collection Account,
         the Prefunding Account and the Capitalized Interest Account shall
         remain uninvested. In addition, if the applicable depository
         institution receives what it perceives to be conflicting directions
         regarding the investment of funds in the Collection Account, the Spread
         Account, the Prefunding Account or the Capitalized Interest Account,
         the directions of the Insurer shall control unless an Insurer Default
         shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the directions of
         the Servicer shall control unless a Servicer Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, in which case the directions of the Issuer
         shall control. In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall not in any way
         be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in any of the foregoing
         Trust Accounts held by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee resulting
         from any investment loss on any Eligible Investments.

                  SECTION 4.02      COLLECTIONS; TRANSFERS TO PAYAHEAD ACCOUNT;
REALIZATION UPON POLICY; NET DEPOSITS; TRANSFERS TO PAYMENT ACCOUNT.

                  (a)      Subject to the last sentence of this Section 4.02(a),
         the Servicer shall remit or credit all payments on a daily basis,
         within two Business Days of receipt, by or on behalf of Obligors on the
         Contracts, and all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance

                                      -58-
<PAGE>
         Proceeds and other monies as required to the Collection Account. Prior
         to the Servicer Report Date, amounts with respect to Precomputed
         Contracts which are otherwise required to be deposited in or credited
         to the Collection Account pursuant to the immediately preceding
         sentence shall instead be deposited in or credited to the Payahead
         Account to the extent that such amounts are installments of Monthly P&I
         which are due in a Collection Period relating to a Distribution Date
         subsequent to the Distribution Date immediately succeeding the date of
         receipt. The Servicer or the Seller, as the case may be, each shall
         remit or credit to the Collection Account each Purchase Amount to be
         remitted by it with respect to Purchased Contracts on the Business Day
         preceding the Servicer Report Date next succeeding (i) the end of the
         Collection Period in which the applicable Contract is repurchased by
         the Seller pursuant to Section 2.03, in the case of the Seller or (ii)
         the last day of the related cure period specified in Section 3.07, in
         the case of the Servicer.

                  (b)      On the Servicer Report Date, the Servicer shall
         determine the Insured Amount, if any, which exists with respect to the
         related Distribution Date and submit a Distribution Date Statement
         pursuant to Section 3.09.

                  (c)      The Indenture Trustee shall, no later than 10:00
         a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day prior to each
         Distribution Date (based solely on the information contained in the
         Distribution Date Statement, delivered on the applicable Servicer
         Report Date), make a claim under the Policy for the Insured Amount, if
         any, for such Distribution Date by delivering to the Insurer, with a
         copy to the Trust Agent and the Servicer, by hand delivery, telex or
         facsimile transmission, a written notice (a "Deficiency Notice")
         specifying the Insured Amount, if any, for such Distribution Date,
         separately identifying the amount of the Insured Amount payable in
         respect of each Class of Notes. Each Deficiency Notice shall direct the
         Insurer to remit such Insured Amount to the Indenture Trustee for
         deposit in the Payment Account. In making any such claim, the Indenture
         Trustee shall comply with all the terms and conditions of the Policy.
         Upon receipt of the Insured Amount, the Indenture Trustee shall apply
         the portion thereof, if any, representing the Deficiency Amount with
         respect to a Distribution Date as provided in Section 4.03. Any amounts
         received by the Indenture Trustee under the Policy that represent
         Avoided Payment Amounts shall be paid, in accordance with the Policy,
         to the applicable Noteholder(s).

                  (d)      So long as Onyx is the Servicer, the Servicer may
         make deposits in or credits to the Collection Account net of amounts to
         be paid to the Servicer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, the Servicer shall maintain the records and accounts for
         such deposits and credits on a gross basis.

                  (e)      On the Business Day immediately preceding each
         Distribution Date, based solely on the Distribution Date Statement, the
         Servicer shall cause funds equal to the amount of Net Collections
         available with respect to such Distribution Date on deposit in the
         Collection Account to be withdrawn from the Collection Account and
         deposited into the Payment Account to be distributed pursuant to
         Section 4.03.

                  SECTION 4.03      DISTRIBUTIONS.

         On each Distribution Date, based solely on the Distribution Date
Statement, the Indenture Trustee will apply the Net Collections available from
the Payment Account, along with any amounts deposited into the Payment Account
from the Prefunding Account and the Capitalized Interest Account, with respect
to such Distribution Date to make the following deposits and distributions in
the following amounts and order of priority:

                  (i)               to the Servicer, the Servicing Fee,
                                    including any accrued and unpaid Servicing
                                    Fees with respect to one or more prior
                                    Collection Periods;

                  (ii)              to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee
                                    and the Trust Agent, any accrued and unpaid
                                    fees (which amounts do not include any
                                    expenses) of the Indenture Trustee, the
                                    Owner Trustee and the Trust Agent, in each
                                    case to the extent such fees have not been
                                    previously paid by the Servicer or the
                                    Administrator;

                  (iii)             to the Note Distribution Account, the Note
                                    Interest Distributable Amount to be paid to
                                    the Holders of the Class A Notes at their
                                    respective Interest Rates;

                  (iv)              to the Note Distribution Account, if such
                                    Distribution Date is a Note Final Scheduled
                                    Distribution Date for any Class of Notes,
                                    the Note Principal Distributable Amount to
                                    the extent of the remaining principal amount
                                    of such Class of Notes, to be paid to the
                                    Holders of such Class of Notes;

                  (v)               if such Distribution Date is the Mandatory
                                    Partial Redemption Date, to the Note

                                    amount is less than or equal to $50,000, and
                                    to be distributed to the Holders of all

                                    outstanding principal balance of the Notes,
                                    if such amount exceeds $50,000;

                  (vi)              to the Note Distribution Account, solely
                                    from Net Collections (plus amounts

                                    through (vi) above, (A) any amounts,
                                    including the Premium, owing to the Insurer
                                    under the Insurance Agreement and (B) any
                                    unreimbursed Insurer Defense Costs;

                  (viii)            to the Spread Account, after giving effect
                                    to the distributions described in clauses

                                    required to increase the amount therein to
                                    the Spread Account Maximum for such

                  (ix)              any amounts remaining after distribution of
                                    the Accelerated Principal Distributable
                                    Amount as part of the Note Principal
                                    Distributable Amount, if applicable, shall
                                    be deposited into the Spread Account.

Any amounts deposited in the Payment Account pursuant to 4.04(b) with respect to
a Distribution Date and any amounts received by the Indenture Trustee as a
result of a claim under the Policy that represent the Deficiency Amount with
respect to such Distribution Date shall be applied by the Indenture Trustee
solely to make the deposits and distributions referred to in clauses (i) through
(iv) above, in that order of priority, but only to the extent that the Net
Collections (plus amounts transferred to the Payment Account from the Prefunding
Account, representing earnings from investments therein, and amounts transferred
to the Payment Account from the Capitalized Interest Account, if any) with
respect to such Distribution Date, after application as provided above, were
insufficient to make such deposit or distribution. In addition, if the Insurer
pays any amounts to the Indenture Trustee with respect to a Distribution Date in
connection with the Insurer's election to pay, as provided in the Policy, all or
a portion of any shortfalls in the amount of Net Collections (plus amounts
transferred to the Payment Account from the Prefunding Account, representing
earnings from investments therein, and amounts transferred to the Payment
Account from the Capitalized Interest Account, if any) with respect to such
Distribution Date available to distribute the amounts referred to in clause (vi)
above, the Indenture Trustee shall distribute the amounts so received from the
Insurer as provided in such clause.

                  SECTION 4.04      SPREAD ACCOUNT.

                  (a)      The Spread Account will be held for the benefit of
         the Noteholders and the Insurer.

                  (b)      On each Distribution Date, based solely on the
         Distribution Date Statement, the Indenture Trustee shall withdraw funds
         from the Spread Account, to the extent funds are on deposit therein,
         equal to the amount by which the sum of the amounts set forth in
         Section 4.03, clauses (i) though (iv) with respect to such Distribution
         Date

                                      -61-

         exceeds the amount of Net Collections (plus amounts transferred to the
         Payment Account from the Prefunding Account, representing earnings from
         investments therein, and amounts transferred to the Payment Account
         from the Capitalized Interest Account, if any) available with respect
         to such Distribution Date. The Indenture Trustee shall deposit any such
         funds withdrawn from the Spread Account into the Payment Account to be
         distributed pursuant to Section 4.03. Funds shall also be withdrawn
         from the Spread Account by the Indenture Trustee, as directed by the
         Insurer to reimburse the Insurer for draws with respect to any Avoided
         Payment Amount. If the amount of cash on deposit in the Spread Account
         on any Distribution Date (after giving effect to all deposits thereto
         or withdrawals therefrom on such Distribution Date other than
         withdrawals relating to distributions to be made pursuant to this
         sentence) exceeds the maximum amount of the cash component of the
         Spread Account, as specified in the definition of "Spread Account
         Maximum" set forth in the Insurance Agreement, the Indenture Trustee
         shall, based solely on the Distribution Date Statement, distribute any
         excess first, to the Insurer, to the extent of any amounts owing to the
         Insurer pursuant to the Insurance Agreement, and any unreimbursed
         Insurer Defense Costs, and second, to the Residual Distribution Account
         for distribution to holders of the Residual Interests pursuant to the
         Trust Agreement. Upon any such distributions to the Insurer or the
         holders of the Residual Interests, the Noteholders will have no further
         rights in, or claims to, such amounts.

                  (c)      Amounts held in the Spread Account shall be invested
         in the manner specified in Section 4.01(c), and such investments shall
         be made in accordance with written instructions from the Servicer;
         provided that, if the Indenture Trustee does not receive any such
         written instructions prior to any date on which an investment decision
         must be made, the funds held in the Spread Account will remain
         uninvested. All such investments shall be made in the name of the
         Indenture Trustee or its nominee and such investments shall not be sold
         or disposed of prior to their maturity.

                  (d)      Ninety-one (91) days following the termination of the
         Trust pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Trust Agreement, any amounts on
         deposit in the Spread Account, after payments of amounts due to the
         Noteholders or the Insurer pursuant to the Insurance Agreement, and any
         unreimbursed Insurer Defense Costs, shall be paid to the holders of the
         Residual Interests; provided, however, that if an insolvency event of
         the type described in Section 7.01(d) or (e) with respect to any of the
         Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
         (collectively, the "POTENTIAL PREFERENCE PARTIES") shall have occurred
         during the period ending ninety-one (91) days after payment in full to
         the Noteholders of all amounts payable with respect to the Notes and
         the payment in full of the Repayment Amount then the funds on deposit
         in the Spread Account shall be retained until the date all applicable
         statute of limitation periods with respect to all applicable preference
         actions and periods have expired and during which time no preference
         action or similar proceeding at law or in equity is commenced, at which
         time, the Insurer shall direct the Indenture Trustee in writing to
         release all amounts in the Spread Account to the holders of the
         Residual Interests, pro rata in proportion to percentage portion of the
         Residual Interest (the "PERCENTAGE INTEREST") of each such holder of
         the Residual Interests. In the event that any preference action
         referred to above is commenced during any applicable statute of
         limitations period, funds deposited in the Spread Account shall be
         retained until the date on which there is a final determination by

                                      -62-

         a court of competent jurisdiction as to whether any payment or payments
         made pursuant to this Agreement, the Indenture, the Indemnification
         Agreement or the Insurance Agreement is recoverable from any of the
         Insurer or the Noteholders. If it is so determined that a payment is so
         recoverable, funds deposited in the Spread Account shall be applied by
         the Indenture Trustee at the written direction of the Insurer first to
         pay any and all such claims with respect to such preference actions as
         the Noteholders and the Insurer may be required to pay and then to the
         holders of the Residual Interests, pro rata in proportion to their
         Percentage Interests. If it is determined that any such payment is not
         recoverable, the Insurer shall direct the Indenture Trustee in writing
         to release all amounts on deposit in the Spread Account to the holders
         of the Residual Interests, pro rata in proportion to their Percentage
         Interests, upon receipt by the Insurer of both a final order
         determining that such payments are not recoverable and an opinion of
         nationally recognized bankruptcy counsel to the effect that such appeal
         is final and not subject to appeal. For purposes of compliance with
         this Section 4.04(d), the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to rely
         on written instructions from the Insurer.

                  (e)      In the event any of the holders of the Residual
         Interests seek to have the amounts remaining on deposit in the Spread
         Account released to holders of the Residual Interests prior to the
         expiration of the ninety-one (91) day period specified in Section
         4.04(d) above, then, if (i) amounts payable with respect to the Notes
         have been fully paid to the Noteholders, (ii) the Repayment Amount and
         all other amounts owing to the Insurer pursuant to the Insurance
         Agreement, and any unreimbursed Insurer Defense Costs have been paid in
         full, (iii) no case or proceeding described in Sections 7.01(d) or (e)
         has occurred with respect to the Potential Preference Parties, and (iv)
         either (A) the long term unsecured debt of the Seller and the Servicer
         is rated "BBB-" or better by Standard & Poor's and "Baa3" or better by
         Moody's, (B) the Insurer shall have received a favorable opinion or
         opinions, satisfactory in form and substance to the Insurer, from
         counsel to Onyx, the Seller and the Servicer, to the effect that in the
         event a case or proceeding described in Sections 7.01(d) or (e) were to
         occur with respect to the Potential Preference Parties, no payment
         pursuant to this Agreement or the Insurance Agreement would be
         recoverable from either the Insurer or the Noteholders, and such other
         matters as the Insurer may reasonably request, or (C) the Insurer, in
         its sole discretion, elects to have the remaining amounts on deposit in
         the Spread Account paid to the holders of the Residual Interests, then,
         in any such event, all remaining amounts on deposit in the Spread
         Account shall be paid to the holders of the Residual Interests, pro
         rata in proportion to their Percentage Interests.

                  SECTION 4.05      STATEMENTS TO NOTEHOLDERS.

         (a)      On each Distribution Date, the Indenture Trustee shall make
available on its website at www.jpmorgan.com/absmbs to each Noteholder of record

Trustee shall release to the Seller from the Capitalized Interest Account an

an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Prefunded Contracts

Date by 1:00 p.m. California time on such Prefunding Transfer Date.

         (c)      If any amount remains on deposit in the Prefunding Account on
the last day of the Funding Period, such amount shall be invested at the written

Date, the Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee in writing to withdraw

                                      -66-

<PAGE>
by conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all the assets of the Seller as

Issuer, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer, which contains
an assumption by such successor entity of the due and punctual performance and
observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the
Seller under this Agreement.

Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer,

Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Custodian with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein and in the other Basic Documents, including, without
limitation, any sales, gross receipts, general corporation, tangible personal

Issuer, any taxes asserted with respect to, and as of the date of, the sale of
the Contracts to the Issuer or the issuance and original sale of the Notes, or
(ii) any taxes asserted with respect to ownership of the Contracts, or (iii) any
federal or other income taxes arising out of distributions on the Notes) and
costs and expenses in defending against the same.

         (c)      The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer,
the Custodian (if the Custodian is not the Servicer), their respective officers,
directors, agents and employees and the Noteholders from and against any and all
costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities to the extent that such

upon any such Person through, the negligence (other than errors in judgment),
willful misfeasance or bad faith of the Servicer or the Seller in the
performance of their respective duties under this Agreement.

         (d)      The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer,
the Custodian (if the Custodian is not the Servicer) and their respective
officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all costs,
expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or incurred in
connection with the acceptance or performance of the trusts and duties herein
and, in the case of the Owner Trustee and the Trust Agent, in the Trust
Agreement and, in the case of the Indenture Trustee, in the Indenture, except to
the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability (i) shall
be due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Owner Trustee,
the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Custodian, as the
case may be; (ii) relates to any tax other than the taxes with respect to which
either the Servicer shall be required to indemnify the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Custodian;
or (iii) shall arise from the Trust Agent's, the Owner Trustee's or the
Indenture Trustee's breach of any of their respective representations or
warranties set forth herein, in the Trust Agreement or in the Indenture.

         (e)      In addition to the indemnification obligations set forth

legal fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever in any way relating
to or arising out of the Trust Agreement, the other Basic Documents, the Trust
Estate (as defined in the Trust Agreement), the administration of the Trust
Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner Trustee, Trust Agent or any
co-trustee under the Trust Agreement, except to the extent that such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, taxes, claims, actions, suits, costs,
expenses and disbursements (i) shall be due to the willful misconduct or
negligence of the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, a co-trustee or

                                      -69-
<PAGE>
such other party seeking indemnification, as the case may be, or (ii) shall
arise from the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in Section
7.03 of the Trust Agreement expressly made by the Owner Trustee or the Trust
Agent, as the case may be. In the event of any claim, action or proceeding for
which indemnity will be sought pursuant to this Section 6.01(e), the choice of
legal counsel by the Owner Trustee or the Trust Agent, as applicable, shall be
subject to the approval of the Servicer, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

         (f)      Indemnification under this Section shall include, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation.
If the Servicer shall have made any indemnity payments pursuant to this section
and the recipient thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, the
recipient Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the Servicer, without
interest.

         (g)      This Section 6.01 shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Custodian and the Indenture Trustee and
the termination of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture.

                  SECTION 6.02      CORPORATE EXISTENCE; STATUS AS SERVICER;
MERGER.

         (a)      The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and will obtain and preserve its qualification to do business as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall
be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of the Contract
Documents and this Agreement.

         (b)      The Servicer shall not consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its
assets as an entirety to any Person or engage in any corporate transaction
pursuant to which the surviving or successor entity is not Onyx Acceptance
Corporation, unless (i) such entity is at least rated investment grade by the
Rating Agencies, (ii) the Insurer shall have consented thereto in writing and
(iii) such entity executes and delivers to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and
the Insurer an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer, which contains an assumption by
such successor entity of the due and punctual performance and observance of each
covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the Servicer under this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.03      PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS

         (a)      The Servicer shall punctually perform and observe all of its
obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement.

         (b)      The Servicer shall not take any action, or permit any action
to be taken by others, which would excuse any person from any of its covenants
or obligations under any of the Contract Documents or under any other instrument
included in the Trust Property, or which would result in the amendment,
hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the
validity or effectiveness of, any of the Contract Documents or any such
instrument, except as expressly provided herein and therein.

                  SECTION 6.04      SERVICER NOT TO RESIGN; ASSIGNMENT.

         (a)      The Servicer shall not resign from the duties and obligations
hereby imposed on it except upon determination by its Board of Directors that by
reason of change in applicable legal requirements the continued performance by
the Servicer of its duties hereunder would cause it to be in violation of such
legal requirements in a manner which would result in a material adverse effect
on the Servicer or its financial condition, said determination to be evidenced
by a resolution of its Board of Directors to such effect accompanied by an
Opinion of Counsel, satisfactory to the Issuer, the Insurer and the Indenture
Trustee, to such effect. No such resignation shall become effective unless and
until (i) the Indenture Trustee assumes all of the Servicer's obligations under
this Agreement or (ii) a new servicer acceptable to the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Insurer is willing to service the Contracts and enters into a
servicing agreement with the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer in
form and substance substantially similar to this Agreement and satisfactory to
the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer, and each Rating Agency
confirms that the selection of such new servicer will not result in the
qualification, reduction or withdrawal of its then-current rating of each Class
of Notes assigned by such Rating Agency. No such resignation by the Servicer
shall affect the obligation of the Servicer to repurchase Contracts pursuant to
Section 3.07.

         (b)      Except as specifically permitted in this Agreement, the
Servicer may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights, powers, duties or
obligations hereunder; provided that (i) the Servicer may assign this Agreement
in connection with a consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease made
in compliance with Section 6.02(b).

         (c)      Except as provided in Sections 6.04(a) and (b), the duties and
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement shall continue until this
Agreement shall have been terminated as provided in Section 8.01 or the Trust
shall have been terminated as provided by the terms of the Trust Agreement, and
shall survive the exercise by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Insurer
of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or the enforcement by the Issuer,
the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder, or the Insurer of any provision of the
Notes, the Insurance Agreement or this Agreement.

         (d)      The resignation of the Servicer in accordance with this
Section shall not affect the rights of the Seller hereunder. If the Servicer
resigns pursuant to this Section, its appointment as custodian may be terminated
pursuant to Section 2.08.

                  SECTION 6.05      LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF SERVICER AND
OTHERS.

         Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Issuer or the
Noteholders, except as provided under this Agreement, for any action taken or
for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the
Servicer or any such person against any liability that would otherwise be
imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors
in judgment) in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Servicer and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on

                                      -71-
<PAGE>
any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any
person respecting any matters arising under this Agreement.

         Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be under
any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that shall not
be incidental to its duties to service the Contracts in accordance with this
Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability;
provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable action that it
may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the other Basic
Documents and the rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents and the interests of the Noteholders under this Agreement
and the other Basic Documents.

Trustee and (ii) continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on

an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the failure by the Servicer or the
Seller generally to pay its debts as such debts become due or the taking of
corporate action by the Servicer or the Seller in furtherance of any of the

         (f)      any change of control of the Servicer in violation of the

Holders evidencing not less than 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the
Notes, acting together as a single Class, or the Indenture Trustee acting on
behalf of the Noteholders, and not the Seller, by notice then given in writing
to the Servicer (and to the Insurer, the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer if
given by the Noteholders) may terminate all the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement. Upon such termination, termination of the
Servicer as custodian, if the Servicer is acting as such, can be made pursuant
to Section 2.08. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice,
all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with
respect to the Notes, the Contracts or otherwise, shall, without further action,
pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee or such Successor Servicer as may
be appointed under Section 7.02; and, without limitation, the Indenture Trustee
and the Issuer are hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on
behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in fact or otherwise, any and all documents
and

                                      -73-
<PAGE>
other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement of the Contracts and related documents, or
otherwise. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and the
Issuer in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the
Servicer under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Indenture Trustee
for administration by it of all cash amounts that (i) shall at the time be held
by the Servicer for deposit in, or shall have been deposited by the Servicer in,
the Collection Account or Payahead Account or (ii) shall thereafter be received
by it with respect to any Contract.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Onyx is not the
Servicer, then all references to the Seller in this Section 7.01 shall be of no
force and effect, and no act of Seller shall constitute a Servicer Default
hereunder.

                  SECTION 7.02      TRUSTEE TO ACT; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.

         Upon the termination of the Servicer by the Insurer pursuant to Section
7.01 or resignation of the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04, the Insurer shall
appoint a successor servicer ("SUCCESSOR SERVICER"). Upon the termination of the
Servicer by the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders pursuant to Section 7.01,
or upon the resignation of the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04 in the event
that the Insurer is not entitled to appoint a successor servicer by operation of
Section 9.08, (i) if the Notes have not been paid in full, the Indenture Trustee
shall be the Successor Servicer, and (ii) if the Notes have been paid in full,
the Owner Trustee, acting at the direction of the Holders of Residual Interest
Instruments evidencing not less than 51% of the Percentage Interests shall
appoint a Successor Servicer. The Successor Servicer shall succeed to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement,
except that such Successor Servicer shall not be obligated to purchase Contracts
pursuant to Section 3.07. If the Indenture Trustee acts as Successor Servicer,
the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation (whether payable
out of the Collection Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been
entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of termination shall have
been given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Notes have not been paid in
full, the Indenture Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to act, or shall, if
it shall be legally unable to so act, appoint, or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint, any established financial institution, having a net
worth of not less than $50,000,000 and whose regular business shall include the
servicing of automotive retail installment sales contracts, as the successor to
the Servicer under this Agreement. Pending appointment of any such Successor
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee shall act in such capacity as provided above. In
connection with such appointment, the Indenture Trustee or any other Successor
Servicer may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out
of payments on Contracts as it, the Insurer and such successor shall agree;
provided, however, (i) that such amount shall equal the product of a fixed
percentage rate and the Principal Balance, as of the commencement of each
Collection Period, of each Contract and (ii) that no such compensation shall be
in excess of that previously permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. The
Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent with
this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

                  SECTION 7.03      NOTIFICATION TO NOTEHOLDERS AND RESIDUAL
INTERESTHOLDERS.

         Upon any termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer
pursuant to this Article, the Trust Agent shall give prompt written notice
thereof to Residual Interestholders at their respective addresses appearing in
the Certificate Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written
notice thereof to Noteholders at their respective addresses appearing in the
Note Register.

                  SECTION 7.04      WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.

         Upon the occurrence of a Servicer Default, unless an Insurer Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Insurer, and only the Insurer, may
waive any default by the Servicer or the Seller, as the case may be, in the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a
Servicer Default, if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, Holders
evidencing not less than 51% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes,
acting together as a single Class, on behalf of all Noteholders, shall have the
right to waive any default by the Servicer or the Seller, as the case may be, in
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement except a Servicer
Default in making any required deposits to or payment from the Trust Accounts in
accordance with this Agreement. A Servicer Default in making any required
deposits to or payment from the Trust Accounts in accordance with this Agreement
may only be waived with the consent of the Insurer (if no Insurer Default shall
have occurred and be continuing) or, if an Insurer Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, by Holders evidencing 100% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes. No such waiver shall impair the Insurer's or the
Noteholders' rights with respect to subsequent defaults.

                  SECTION 7.05      INSURER DIRECTION OF INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS.

         The Indenture Trustee, upon the actual knowledge of a Responsible
Officer of the Indenture Trustee, shall promptly notify the Insurer of (i) the
commencement of any of the events or proceedings (individually, an "INSOLVENCY
PROCEEDING") described in the Section 7.01(d) or 7.01(e) hereof or otherwise
defined as an "Insolvency Proceeding" in the Policy and (ii) the making of any
claim in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding seeking the avoidance as a
preferential transfer (a "PREFERENCE CLAIM") of any payment of principal of, or
interest on, any Notes. Any Avoided Payment Amounts paid by the Insurer shall be
reimbursed to the Insurer as provided in Section 4.03 and 4.04(b). Each
Noteholder, by its purchase of Notes, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent and the
Indenture Trustee hereby agree that, so long as no Insurer Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Insurer may at any time during the continuation of an
Insolvency Proceeding direct all matters relating to such Insolvency Proceeding,
including, without limitation, (i) all matters relating to any Preference Claim,
(ii) the direction of any appeal of any order relating to any Preference Claim
and (iii) the posting of any surety or performance bond pending any such appeal.
The Insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent and each Noteholder in the conduct of any
Insolvency Proceeding, including, without limitation, all rights of any party to
an adversary proceeding action with respect to any court order issued in
connection with any such Insolvency Proceeding.

                                   TERMINATION

                  SECTION 8.01      OPTIONAL PURCHASE OF ALL TRUST PROPERTY;
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF THE INDENTURE.

         (a)      On each Distribution Date as of which the Pool Balance is 10%
or less of the Original Pool Balance, the Servicer shall have the option to
purchase the remaining Trust Property from the Trust. Notice of the exercise of
such option shall be given by the Servicer to the Issuer, the Trust Agent, the
Indenture Trustee and the Insurer not later than the 10th day prior to the
specified Distribution Date and not earlier than the 15th day of the month prior
to the month of the specified Distribution Date. To exercise such option, the
Servicer shall pay to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders,
by deposit in the Collection Account on the Business Day immediately preceding
the related Distribution Date, the greater of (i) the sum of (x) the Pool
Balance on the date of repurchase plus (y) accrued and unpaid interest on the
Contracts and (ii) the sum of (x) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Notes plus (y) accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus (z) all amounts due to
the Insurer under the Insurance Agreement, and any unreimbursed Insurer Defense
Costs. Such purchase shall be deemed to have occurred on the last day of the
related Collection Period.

         (b)      Notice of any termination of the Trust shall be given by the
Servicer to the Owner Trustee, the Trust Agent, the Insurer and the Indenture
Trustee as soon as practicable after the Servicer has received notice thereof.
Such notice shall conform to the notice described in Section 9.01(c) of the
Trust Agreement.

         (c)      Following the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture and
the payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Notes, the Residual
Interestholders will succeed to the rights of the Noteholders hereunder and the
Owner Trustee and, on its behalf, the Trust Agent, will succeed to the rights
of, and assume the obligations of, the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02      TRANSFER TO THE INSURER.

         If (i) there are one or more Outstanding Contracts at the end of the
Collection Period ending immediately prior to the Class A-4 Final Scheduled
Distribution Date and (ii) an amount sufficient to pay the Note Distributable
Amount on the Class A-4 Final Scheduled Distribution Date has been deposited
with the Indenture Trustee by the Insurer for the benefit of the Noteholders,
then on the Class A-4 Final Scheduled Distribution Date, the Class A-4 Notes
shall be deemed to be transferred by the Class A-4 Noteholders to the Insurer or
its designee as purchaser thereof at the opening of business on the Class A-4
Final Scheduled Distribution Date and the Indenture Trustee shall execute, and
the Trust Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Insurer or its designee,
in the name of the Insurer or its designee, as the case may be, a new Class A-4
Note evidencing the entire outstanding principal amount of the Class A-4 Notes.
Such new Class A-4 Note shall have the same terms as the Class A-4 Notes deemed
transferred by the Class A-4 Noteholders. No service charge shall be made for
the issuance of such Class A-4 Note to the Insurer or its designee, but the
Indenture Trustee or Trust Agent may require payment of a

                                      -76-
<PAGE>
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in
connection therewith. Such transfer shall not diminish or restrict the Insurer's
rights hereunder or under the Insurance Agreement.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 9.01      AMENDMENT.

         (a)      This Agreement may be amended by the Issuer, the Seller, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Trust Agent, collectively, with the
prior written consent of the Insurer, but without the consent of any
Noteholders, provided the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied, to cure any
ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions in this Agreement which are
inconsistent with the provisions herein, or to make any other provisions with
respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement which are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that any
such action shall not materially and adversely affect the interests of any
Noteholder; and provided, further, that any such amendment shall be deemed not
to materially and adversely affect the interests of any Noteholder if the Rating
Agency Condition is satisfied.

         (b)      This Agreement may also be amended by the Issuer, the Seller,
the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Trust Agent, with the consent of the
Insurer and the Holders of Notes evidencing in the aggregate not less than 51%
of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, acting together as a
single Class, provided the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied, for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of the provisions of this Agreement, or of modifying in any manner the rights of
the Noteholders; provided, however, that no such amendment shall (i) increase or
reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of,
collections of payments on the Contracts or distributions that shall be required
to be made for the benefit of the Noteholders or (ii) reduce the aforesaid
percentage of the outstanding amount of the Notes the Holders of which are
required to consent to any such amendment, without the consent of all affected
Noteholders.

         (c)      Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent,
the Indenture Trustee shall furnish the written notification of the substance of
such amendment or consent to each Noteholder, respectively.

         (d)      It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders
pursuant to Section 9.01(b) to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing
the authorization by Noteholders of the execution thereof shall be subject to
such reasonable requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe. Any consent
by a Noteholder to an amendment of the Agreement shall be conclusive and binding
on such Noteholder and upon all future Noteholders of such Note and of any Note
issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange thereof or in lieu thereof
whether or not notation of such consent is made upon such Note.

be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects the Trust Agent's
or the Indenture Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement
or otherwise and any such amendment shall be unenforceable in its entirety
absent the execution of such amendment by the Trust Agent and the Indenture
Trustee.

the Trust Agent and the Insurer in the Contracts and in the proceeds thereof.
The Servicer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Trust Agent and the
Indenture Trustee file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any document
filed as provided above, as soon as available following such filing.

identity or corporate structure in any manner that would, could or might make
any financing statement or continuation statement filed in accordance with
Section 9.02(a) seriously misleading within the meaning of Section 9-508(b) of
the UCC, unless it shall have given the Insurer, the Trust Agent and the
Indenture Trustee at least 60 days' prior written notice thereof.

         (c)      The Seller and the Servicer shall give the Insurer, the Trust
Agent and the Indenture Trustee at least 60 days' prior written notice of any
relocation of the state of organization of the Seller and the Servicer if, as a
result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require
the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation
statement or of any new financing statement. The Servicer shall at all times
maintain each office from which it shall service Contracts, and its principal
executive office, within the United States.

         (d)      The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained accounts

computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale under this Agreement
of the Contracts to the Issuer, the Servicer's master computer records
(including any backup archives) that shall refer to a Contract indicate clearly
the interest of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in such Contract and that
such Contract is owned by the Issuer and has been pledged to the Indenture
Trustee.

         (f)      If at any time the Seller or the Servicer shall propose to
sell, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in

the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer and their respective agents, at any time

written notice to the other parties. Any notice required or permitted to be to
be mailed to a Noteholder shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid,

mailed within the time prescribed herein shall be conclusively presumed to have
been duly given, whether or not such Noteholder shall receive such notice.

                  SECTION 9.05      SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.

         If the covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement
shall be for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants,
agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement
or of the Notes or the rights of the Holders thereof.

                  SECTION 9.06      ASSIGNMENT.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as
provided in Sections 5.02 and 6.02, neither the Seller nor the Servicer may
transfer or assign all, or a portion of, its rights, obligations and duties
under this Agreement unless such transfer or assignment (i) (A) will not result
in a reduction or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of the rating then assigned by

consented to such transfer or assignment, or (ii) the Insurer, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and Holders of Notes of each Class evidencing not less than
51% of the outstanding amount of Notes of such Class consent thereto. Any

the event of a transfer or assignment pursuant to clause (ii) above, each Rating
Agency shall be provided with notice of such transfer or assignment.

                  SECTION 9.07      THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.

Agreement.

         So long as an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be
continuing, the Insurer shall have the right to exercise all rights, including
voting rights, which the Noteholders are entitled to exercise pursuant to this
Agreement, without any consent of such Noteholders; provided, however, that
without the consent of each Noteholder or Residual Interestholder affected
thereby, the Insurer shall not exercise such rights to amend this Agreement in
any manner that

                                      -81-

would (i) reduce the amount of, or delay the timing of, collections of payments
on the Contracts or distributions which are required to be made on any Note or
Residual Interest Instrument, (ii) adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of the Holders of any Notes or Residual Interest Instruments or (iii)
alter the rights of any such Holder to consent to such amendment.

         Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, for so
long as an Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Insurer
shall not have the right to take any action under this Agreement or to control
or direct the actions of the Trust, the Seller, the Indenture Trustee, the
Servicer or the Trust Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, nor shall
the consent of the Insurer be required with respect to any action (or waiver of
a right to take action) to be taken by the Trust, the Seller, the Indenture
Trustee, the Servicer, the Trust Agent or the Holders of the Notes pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement; provided, that the consent of the Insurer shall be
required at all times with respect to any amendment of this Agreement.

         The headings of the various Articles and Sections herein are for
convenience of reference only and shall not define or limit any of the terms or
provisions hereof.

         The Seller hereby acknowledges and consents to any mortgage, pledge,

Insurer of all right, title and interest of the Issuer in, to and under the
Trust Property and/or the assignment of any or all of the Issuer's rights and
obligations hereunder to the Indenture Trustee.

                  SECTION 9.11      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF OWNER TRUSTEE AND

instrument has been executed by The Bank of New York (Delaware) not in its

JPMorgan Chase Bank not in its individual capacity but in its capacity as
