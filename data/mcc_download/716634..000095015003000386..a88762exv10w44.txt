            (c) Except as expressly prohibited in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this

            (d) If Citadel shall have received any payment or distribution in

      or Citadel Event of Default, as the case may be. Nationwide shall confirm
      in writing, in response to a written request from Citadel or any of its

      of any obligation of SHC to Nationwide specified in such request. If such
      confirmation is not provided within ten (10) Business Days following
      Nationwide's receipt thereof, the requesting party can assume that such
      payment(s) had not been made. Failure to give any of such notices in the
      foregoing sentences shall not affect the subordination of the Citadel
      Indebtedness to the Nationwide Indebtedness as provided herein.

            (f) The provisions of this Section 2.02 shall not modify or limit in
      any way the application of Section 2.04.

            (b) In the event of a Citadel Agreement Payment Default, Citadel is
      entitled to exercise all rights and remedies pursuant to the terms of the
      Citadel Agreement and the Subordinated Documents. In the event of a
      Citadel Event of Default other than a Citadel Agreement Payment Default,

      time period set forth in clause (iv) of this paragraph (b) and prior to
      the occurrence of the event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
      then, for all purposes of this Agreement, such Citadel Event of Default

      connection with an assignment of the Nationwide Indebtedness, sell or
      exchange, its Lien on the Equity Collateral unless and until the
      Nationwide Indebtedness shall have been Fully Paid or Citadel shall have
      given its prior consent to such release, and (ii) if Citadel shall be
      subrogated to the rights and interests of Nationwide pursuant to Section
      2.06 hereof or shall acquire the Nationwide Indebtedness pursuant to
      Section 2.11(h) hereof, Nationwide shall assign to Citadel, without

      any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property,

      character, whether in cash, securities or other property (including any

      provisions of this Section 2.04, shall be paid by SHC, as debtor in
      possession, or any bankruptcy trustee or other agent or other Person
      making such payment or distribution directly to Nationwide, until all
      Nationwide Indebtedness remaining unpaid is Fully Paid, after giving
      effect to any concurrent payments or distributions to or for Nationwide
      for application to the payment of the Nationwide Indebtedness, or any of
      the events described in Section 2.02(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall have
      occurred; and

            (c) If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
      2.04, Citadel shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of
      SHC, or the estate created by the commencement of any such Insolvency or
      Liquidation Proceeding, of any kind or character in respect of the Citadel
      Indebtedness, whether in cash, securities or other property, before all
      Nationwide Indebtedness shall have been Fully Paid, such payment or
      distribution shall be received and held in trust for Nationwide, and shall
      promptly be paid over or delivered to


                                       9
<PAGE>

      Nationwide, for the benefit of Nationwide, until all Nationwide
      Indebtedness then remaining unpaid is Fully Paid, after giving effect to
      any concurrent payments or distributions to or for Nationwide for
      application to the Nationwide Indebtedness, or any of the events described
      in Section 2.02(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall have occurred.

      Section 2.05. Liens. The Liens on the Collateral in favor of Citadel shall
be subject and subordinate in all respects to the Liens in favor of Nationwide.

      Section 2.06 Citadel to Be Subrogated to Rights of Nationwide. Only after
the Nationwide Indebtedness shall have been Fully Paid, Citadel, to the extent
of any payments or distributions of cash, securities and other assets with
respect to the Citadel Indebtedness made to or for Nationwide pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be subrogated to the rights of Nationwide to receive any and
all payments or distributions of cash, securities and other assets payable with
respect to the Nationwide Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Citadel
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full. For the purpose of such subrogation,
no such payments or distributions to or for Nationwide that otherwise would have
been made to Citadel but for this Agreement shall, as between SHC and Citadel,
be deemed to be payment by SHC on account of the Citadel Indebtedness; provided,
however, that (x) unless and until, as between Nationwide and Citadel, the
Nationwide Indebtedness is Fully Paid, Citadel shall not have the right, ability
or power to exercise any rights or remedies in respect of or by reason of such
subrogation and (y) such rights of subrogation, and any claims of Citadel with
respect thereto, are nevertheless limited by and subject to Section 11.12 of the
Citadel Agreement.

      Section 2.07. Relative Rights. (a) This Agreement defines the relative
rights of Citadel, on the one hand, and Nationwide, on the other hand. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to or shall:

                  (i) impair, as between SHC and Citadel, the obligation of SHC
      to pay the amounts payable with respect to the Citadel Indebtedness as and
      when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with its terms;
      or

                  (ii) affect the relative rights against SHC of Citadel and
      creditors of Citadel other than Nationwide.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary, if
      SHC fails, because of this Agreement or otherwise, to pay principal of or
      interest on the Citadel Indebtedness on the due date thereof, such failure
      shall still be considered an Event of Default under paragraph (a) of
      Section 9.1 of the Citadel Agreement except as otherwise provided in said
      paragraph (a).

      hereunder, shall not be affected, modified or impaired in any manner or to
      any extent by: (i) any amendment, modification or termination of or
      supplement to the Nationwide Indebtedness or the Nationwide Agreement, or
      any agreement, instrument or document executed or delivered pursuant
      thereto; (ii) the validity or enforceability of any such document; (iii)
      the release, sale, exchange or surrender, in whole or in part, of any
      collateral security, now or hereafter existing, for any of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or any other indebtedness, liability or obligations of SHC to
      Nationwide, now existing or hereafter arising; (iv) any exercise or
      non-exercise of any right, power or remedy under or in respect of the
      Nationwide Indebtedness or any of such instruments and documents referred
      to in clause (i) above or arising at law; or (v) any waiver, consent,
      release, indulgence, extension, renewal, modification, delay or other
      action, inaction or omission in respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness or
      any of the agreements, instruments or documents referred to in clause (i)
      above or in respect of any collateral security for the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or any other indebtedness, liability or obligation of SHC to
      Nationwide, now existing or hereafter arising, all whether or not Citadel
      shall have had notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing and whether or
      not Citadel shall have consented thereto.

            (b) The terms of this Agreement, and the rights of Citadel and the
      obligations of Nationwide arising hereunder, shall not be affected,
      modified or impaired in any manner or to any extent by: (i) any amendment,
      modification or termination of or supplement to the Citadel Indebtedness
      or the Subordinated Documents, or any agreement, instrument or document
      executed or delivered pursuant thereto; (ii) the validity or
      enforceability of any such document; (iii) the release, sale, exchange or
      surrender, in whole or in part, of any collateral security, now or

      indebtedness, liability or obligations of SHC to Citadel, now existing or
      hereafter arising; (iv) any exercise or non-exercise of any right, power
      or remedy under or in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness or any of such

      modification, delay or other action, inaction or omission in respect of
      the Citadel Indebtedness or any of the agreements, instruments or
      documents referred to in clause (i) above or in respect of any collateral
      security for the Citadel Indebtedness or any other indebtedness, liability
      or obligation of SHC to Citadel, now existing or hereafter arising, all
      whether or not Nationwide shall have had notice or knowledge of any of the
      foregoing and whether or not Nationwide shall have consented thereto.

      Section 2.09 Provisions to Effectuate Subordination of Citadel
Indebtedness.

            (a) In the event of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding,
      Nationwide is irrevocably authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to
      make and present for and on behalf of Citadel such proofs of claim against
      SHC on account of the Citadel Indebtedness or other motions or pleadings
      as Nationwide may deem expedient or proper, to vote such proofs of claim
      in any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, to the extent permitted
      by law, and to receive and collect any and all payments or distributions
      made thereon in whatever form and to apply such payments or distributions
      on account of any of the Nationwide Indebtedness. Citadel irrevocably
      authorizes and empowers Nationwide to demand, sue for, collect and receive
      each of such payments and distributions and to file claims and take such
      other actions, in the name of Nationwide or Citadel or otherwise, as
      Nationwide may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of this
      Agreement. To the extent that payments or distributions are made in
      property other than cash, Citadel authorizes Nationwide to sell such
      property to such buyers and on such terms as Nationwide, in its reasonable
      discretion, shall determine. Citadel will execute and deliver to
      Nationwide such powers of attorney, assignments and other instruments or
      documents as may be requested by Nationwide in order to enable Nationwide
      to enforce any and all claims upon or with respect to the Citadel
      Indebtedness and to collect and receive any and all payments and
      distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time with respect
      thereto.

            (b) Nationwide agrees that it will not exercise any of the rights or
      remedies under paragraph (a) of this Section 2.09 unless Citadel has
      failed to implement any action in question within ten (10) days prior to
      when such action is required pursuant to an Insolvency or Liquidation
      Proceeding.

            (c) Citadel specifically waives: unless Nationwide shall otherwise
      give its prior written consent or the Nationwide Indebtedness is Fully
      Paid, (i) the right to seek to give its credit (secured or otherwise) to
      SHC in any way under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code unless the same is
      subordinated in all respects to the Nationwide Indebtedness in accordance
      with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) the right to take a
      position inconsistent with or contrary to that of Nationwide (including a
      position by Nationwide to take no action) if SHC seeks to use, sell or
      lease the Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or seeks to
      accept or reject any executory contract or lease under Section 365 of the
      Bankruptcy Code; (iii) the right to receive any collateral (including any
      "super priority" or equal or "priming" or replacement Lien) for the
      Citadel Indebtedness, other than the Equity Collateral and the Borrower
      Collateral, in each case subject to Nationwide's Liens thereon to the
      extent provided herein; and (iv) the right to seek adequate protection in
      respect of the Collateral under Section 363 or 361 of the Bankruptcy Code,
      unless and then only to the extent that


                                       12
<PAGE>

      Nationwide does and then only to the extent consistent with the
      subordinated position of Citadel.

      Section 2.10 Subordination not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of SHC or
Nationwide. (a) No right of Nationwide to enforce subordination as provided
herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or
failure to act on the part of SHC or, except as provided in Section 2.10(c), by
any act or failure to act by Nationwide, or by any noncompliance by SHC with the
provisions and covenants of the Nationwide Agreement or the Subordinated
Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof that Nationwide may have or be
otherwise charged with and regardless of whether such action or failure to act
diminishes or destroys any subrogation or other rights that Citadel may have or
reduces or eliminates any eventual recovery in respect of the Citadel
Indebtedness. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Nationwide may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or
notice to Citadel, except as provided in Section 2.10(c), without incurring
responsibility to Citadel and without impairing or releasing the subordination
and other benefits provided in this Agreement or the obligations hereunder of
Citadel to Nationwide, do any one or more of the following even if any right to
reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Citadel is affected,
impaired or extinguished thereby:

                  (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend,
      renew, modify or amend the terms of the Nationwide Indebtedness or any
      agreement or instrument evidencing, securing or guarantying any Nationwide
      Indebtedness (including increasing the amount of principal, changing the
      time and amount of repayments, increasing the rate of interest or
      otherwise changing the terms of the Nationwide Agreement), exercise or
      delay in or refrain from exercising any right or remedy against SHC and
      otherwise deal freely with SHC or any liability of SHC;

                  (ii) release, exercise or delay in or refrain from exercising
      any right or remedy against, change the terms of any agreement or
      instrument with or otherwise deal freely with any guarantor or any other
      Person liable or contingently liable in any manner for the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or any such liability or contingent liability;

                  (iii) settle or compromise any of the Nationwide Indebtedness
      or any other liability of SHC or any guarantor of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness to Nationwide and apply any sums by whomsoever paid and
      however realized to any liability (including, without limitation, the
      Nationwide Indebtedness) in any manner or order; and

                  (iv) fail to take or to record or otherwise perfect, for any
      reason or for no reason, any Lien securing the Nationwide Indebtedness by
      whomsoever granted, and release, sell, exercise or delay in or refrain
      from exercising any right or remedy against, exchange, enforce, realize
      upon, or otherwise deal freely with, in any manner and in any order, any
      of the Collateral.


                                       13
<PAGE>

            (b) Except as provided in Section 2.10(c), Citadel hereby waives any
      and all notice of the creation, modification, renewal, extension or
      accrual of any Nationwide Indebtedness and notice of or proof of reliance
      by Nationwide upon this Agreement, and the Nationwide Indebtedness shall
      conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in
      reliance upon this Agreement, and all dealings between SHC and Nationwide
      shall be deemed to have been consummated in reliance on this Agreement.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any
      other agreement to the contrary, the consent of Citadel shall be required
      for (i) any amendment or modification of the Nationwide Agreement (any of
      the foregoing being a "Change") (A) changing the dates of payment of
      interest, principal, fees or costs in respect of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or shortening the maturity of or requiring the earlier
      payment of any principal or interest in respect of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness, (B) increasing the rate of interest or the amount of any
      payments (including the amount of any fees payable in respect of the
      Nationwide Indebtedness), except for the increase in rate provided for
      therein following maturity thereof, whether at stated maturity, by
      acceleration or otherwise, or (C) adding any requirement for SHC to pay
      any additional fees in respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness, or (ii) any
      Change making any material terms and conditions of the Nationwide
      Agreement more restrictive or burdensome on SHC than the terms and
      conditions of the Nationwide Agreement delivered to Citadel and in effect
      on the date hereof. If any Change is made in contravention of this Section
      2.10(c), any additional liabilities or obligations to Nationwide imposed
      thereby on SHC shall not constitute obligations secured by the Collateral
      and, with respect to such additional liabilities or obligations,
      Nationwide shall not be entitled to any of the benefits of this Agreement,
      the Security Agreement or the Pledge Agreement.

      Section 2.11 Additional Agreements and Waivers.

            (a) Citadel hereby waives (i) any requirement for marshaling of
      assets by Nationwide in connection with any foreclosure of the Liens of
      Nationwide on any Collateral or any other realization upon such
      Collateral, and (ii) any other principle of election of remedies.

            (b) Nationwide shall not have any obligation or duty, nor shall
      Citadel have any right to direct Nationwide, to retain, perfect, protect
      or release any Collateral (except as provided in Section 2.03(c)), to
      foreclose or refrain from foreclosing the Lien of Nationwide on any
      Collateral, to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Nationwide
      Event of Default, to act or refrain from acting with respect to the
      collection of any claim from any account debtor, guarantor or any other
      party, to realize upon any collateral or otherwise to


                                       14
<PAGE>

      exercise or refrain from exercising any rights or remedies in respect of
      such Lien or such Collateral. Except with respect to a violation of
      Section 2.03(c), Nationwide shall not be subject to any liability on
      account of taking or refraining from taking any action referred to in this
      Section 2.11(b), and Citadel waives and agrees to refrain from asserting
      against Nationwide any claim seeking damages or other relief by way of
      specific performance, injunction or otherwise, with respect to any action
      taken or not taken by Nationwide with respect to SHC, the Collateral or
      any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, Citadel waives the right
      to commence or pursue any legal action on account of the exercise or
      non-exercise of rights, remedies or other conduct of Nationwide under the
      Nationwide Agreement or any document entered into in connection therewith,
      including allegations based on a theory of breach of fiduciary obligations
      of Nationwide, duty of care, duty of good faith, duty of reasonableness,
      negligence, equitable subordination of claims, interference with
      contractual relationships, conflicts of interest or otherwise, except for
      willful misconduct by Nationwide or a violation of Section 2.03(c) hereof.

            (c) Solely between Nationwide and Citadel, Citadel assumes
      responsibility for keeping itself informed as to the condition (financial
      or otherwise), business, assets and operations of SHC, the condition of
      the Collateral and all other circumstances that might in any way affect
      Citadel's risk under the Subordinated Documents and this Agreement
      (including without limitation the risk of non-payment of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness), and Nationwide shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever
      to obtain or disclose to Citadel any information or documents relative to
      such condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or operations of
      SHC, such Collateral or such risk, whether acquired by Nationwide in the
      course of its relationship with SHC or otherwise. The terms of this
      Section 2.11(c) shall not impair or affect SHC's obligations arising under
      any Credit Agreement or any of the Subordinated Documents.

            (d) Citadel agrees that the subordination hereunder applies
      regardless of the validity or enforceability of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness or the Nationwide Agreement or the validity, perfection or
      enforceability of the Liens securing the Nationwide Indebtedness.

            (e) Citadel agrees not to (i) take any action to challenge the
      validity, enforceability or amount of any guaranty of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness given by any other Person, (ii) induce any other Person to
      take such action, or (iii) cooperate with any other Person in taking such
      action.

            (f) Within fifteen (15) days following the written request from
      Nationwide or SHC, Citadel shall deliver to SHC and Nationwide an estoppel
      certificate setting forth (i) the amount of principal and interest then
      due, if any, and other amounts then payable (to the extent then
      ascertainable), if any, in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness and (ii)
      whether or not the Subordinated Documents have been amended since the date
      hereof or the date of the


                                       15
<PAGE>

      last such certificate delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be, and
      if so, providing a copy of the relevant amendment documents.

            (g) Within fifteen (15) days following the written request from
      Citadel, each of Nationwide and SHC shall deliver to Citadel an estoppel
      certificate setting forth (i) the amount of principal and interest then
      due, and other amounts then payable (to the extent ascertainable), in
      respect of the Nationwide Indebtedness and (ii) whether or not the
      Nationwide Agreement has been amended since the date hereof or the date of
      the last such certificate delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be,
      and, if so, providing a copy of the relevant amendment documents.
      Nationwide confirms that, as of the date hereof, the outstanding principal
      sum of the Nationwide Indebtedness is eleven million Dollars
      ($11,000,000), and no other sums are now accrued or payable under the
      Nationwide Agreement except accrued interest, not currently due, in
      accordance with the terms of the Nationwide Agreement.

            (h) (i) At any time following a Trigger Event, upon the request of
      Citadel and upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to
      Nationwide, Nationwide will assign to Citadel, without any recourse to, or
      representation or warranty by, Nationwide, the Nationwide Agreement (other
      than Nationwide's claims, if any, in respect of interest and other fees
      and costs thereunder, to the extent not included in the Nationwide
      Accrual) (the "Retained Claims"), which Retained Claims shall be retained
      by and remain the property of Nationwide) upon the payment to Nationwide,
      or as it may direct in writing, of the sum of (x) the principal amount of
      the Nationwide Indebtedness or $11,000,000, whichever is less, and (y) the
      Nationwide Accrual; provided, however, that the Nationwide Indebtedness
      and the Nationwide Agreement, as assigned, will then be subject to Section
      11.12 of the Citadel Agreement. Upon such assignment, this Agreement shall
      terminate and all rights and obligations between Nationwide and Citadel
      shall terminate, except as provided in this Section 2.11(h). Upon such
      assignment, the combined assigned Nationwide Indebtedness and the Citadel
      Indebtedness shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as if such
      combined Indebtedness were the Nationwide Indebtedness and the Retained
      Claims shall be treated as if such Retained Claims were the Citadel
      Indebtedness; provided, however, that nothing herein shall affect, limit
      or impair the right of Nationwide to enforce, collect and retain free from
      any limitations or restrictions of this Agreement payment of the Retained
      Claims from any Person other than SHC.

            (ii) At Citadel's election, payment to Nationwide or an Affiliate
      thereof for the amount required to be paid pursuant to subsection
      2.11(h)(i) may be made by it or an Affiliate making and delivering a note
      for the full amount due, payable in full ninety (90) days from its date,
      with interest thereon payable at the rate of 8.25% monthly in arrears and
      on the date of payment in full (increasing to 9.75% following maturity
      thereof, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise);
      provided, however, that Nationwide (or such


                                       16
<PAGE>

      Affiliate) may require that the maturity date of the note be extended to
      such later date, not beyond the expiration of the Initial Term of the
      Lease Agreement as may be requested by Nationwide (or such Affiliate) in a
      notice given to Citadel not later than sixty (60) days prior to the
      originally stated maturity date of such note, in which case the maker of
      the note and, if applicable, the guarantor thereof shall execute and
      deliver such additional documents to confirm such extension as may be
      appropriate. Such note, if made by an Affiliate of Citadel, shall be fully
      guaranteed as to payment by Citadel, or may in the first instance be made
      by Citadel (in which case no guaranty shall be required). The note and, if
      applicable, the guaranty shall be on terms and conditions reasonably
      satisfactory to Nationwide. The option provided herein in favor of Citadel
      to pay through delivery of a note and, if applicable, a guaranty shall not
      be available in connection with the exercise of the Purchase Option
      pursuant to the Lease Agreement and any such note shall be pre-payable in
      full upon the closing pursuant to the Purchase Option or the purchase or
      other acquisition by Citadel (or an Affiliate) of the Membership Interest
      in SHC.

                  (iii) Upon the payment to Nationwide of the amount required to
      be paid to it pursuant to subsection 2.11(h)(i) (whether in cash or by the
      making and delivery of a note and, if applicable, a guaranty), Nationwide
      shall, as Citadel may request, either satisfy or assign (without recourse
      to, or representation or warranty by, Nationwide) as Citadel shall direct
      any and all Liens securing the Nationwide Indebtedness and any claims
      (other than the Retained Claims) with respect thereto; provided, however,
      that such Liens and claims, if so assigned, will be subject to the
      limitations of Section 11.12 of the Citadel Agreement. Any and all
      Retained Claims shall be unsecured claims and any judgment thereon shall
      not be enforced against or be or become Liens on any assets of SHC.

                  (iv) If the Trigger Event is a Citadel Proceeding and if a Bad
      Faith Determination is entered with respect thereto, then Citadel shall be
      liable: (x) to Nationwide, for all costs and expenses (including
      reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other professional advisors)
      incurred by Nationwide in connection with the Citadel Proceeding and in
      seeking such Bad Faith Determination and for interest (at the
      Reimbursement Rate) on any taxes paid by Nationwide as a result of the
      transfer or repayment of the Nationwide Indebtedness for the period from
      the date such taxes were paid until the date such taxes would have been
      paid if the Nationwide Indebtedness had been repaid at the maturity date
      thereof; and (y) to SHC and its Affiliates, for all costs and expenses
      (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other professional
      advisors) incurred by SHC and its Affiliates in connection with the
      Citadel Proceeding and in seeking such Bad Faith Determination. If
      following the initiation of a Citadel Proceeding either Nationwide or any
      of its Affiliates or SHC or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person
      acting in concert with or with the support of any of them, unsuccessfully
      asserts a claim for a Bad Faith Determination, then Nationwide (if it or
      any of its Affiliates asserted such claim) or James J. Cotter and Michael

            (a) Each Creditor shall not at any time sell, assign, pledge,
      hypothecate, or otherwise transfer its Credit Agreement (or any of its
      respective rights or interests therein), unless and until the transferee,
      pledgee, or other appropriate party shall have assumed in a writing,
      reasonably satisfactory to the other, all of the transferring, pledging,
      or hypothecating Creditor's obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) Each Creditor warrants and represents to the other Creditor that
      it has not previously assigned any interest in its respective
      Indebtedness, that no party owns an interest in its Indebtedness other
      than itself and that its entire Indebtedness is owing only to it. Each
      Creditor covenants that its entire Indebtedness shall continue to be owing
      only to it, unless assigned or transferred in accordance with the terms of
      this Agreement.

      Section 2.13. Representations and Warranties. (a) Each Creditor hereby
represents and warrants for the benefit of the other as follows: (i) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement are within its corporate
power and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each Creditor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by equitable principles or by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally; and (ii) all consents for, in the case of
Nationwide, the amending of the Existing Nationwide Agreement to the Nationwide
Agreement and, in the case of Citadel, the funding to SHC pursuant to the
Citadel Agreement have been obtained and are in effect (or will be obtained and

      whether or not Nationwide is then the holder of the Nationwide
      Indebtedness.

      Section 2.14. Restriction on Amendments to Subordinated Documents. Neither
SHC nor Citadel shall, without the prior written consent of Nationwide, waive,
amend or modify any of the terms and conditions of any Subordinated Document if
the effect of such waiver, amendment or modification is to (a) advance maturity
dates, (b) increase rates or amounts of payments, (c) change any provision
herein, or (d) otherwise make any such terms and conditions more restrictive or
burdensome on SHC than the terms and conditions of the Subordinated Documents
delivered to Nationwide and in effect on the date hereof or at the time of such
amendment or modification.

      Section 2.15. Continuing Agreement of Subordination. This is a continuing
agreement of subordination and Nationwide may continue, at any time and without
notice to Citadel, to extend credit or other financial accommodations to or for
the benefit of SHC in reliance hereon. This Agreement shall be effective and may
not be terminated or otherwise revoked by Citadel until the Nationwide
Indebtedness has been Fully Paid. If Citadel shall have any right under
Applicable Law or otherwise to terminate or revoke this Agreement which cannot
be waived, then, to the extent permitted by law, such termination or revocation
shall not be effective until written notice of such termination or revocation,
signed by Citadel, is given to the holder of such Nationwide Indebtedness. Any
such termination or revocation shall not affect this Agreement in relation to
(a) any Nationwide Indebtedness which arose prior to the receipt thereof, or (b)
any of the Nationwide Indebtedness created after receipt thereof, if such
Nationwide Indebtedness was incurred either through committed advances or
re-advances by Nationwide pursuant to the Nationwide Agreement.

      Section 2.16. Further Assurances.

            (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Nationwide
      Default, Citadel shall duly and promptly take such action as Nationwide
      may reasonably request (a) to collect the Citadel Indebtedness for the
      account of Nationwide and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claims
      in respect of the Citadel Indebtedness, (b) to execute and deliver to
      Nationwide such assignments or other instruments as Nationwide may
      reasonably request in order to enable it to enforce any and all claims
      with respect to the Citadel Indebtedness and any security interests
      securing payment of the Citadel Indebtedness, and (c) to collect and
      receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or
      deliverable with respect to the Citadel Indebtedness.

            (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect Citadel's
      obligations to make any advances pursuant to the terms of the Citadel
      Agreement.
