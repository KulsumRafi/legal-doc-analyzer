THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of MARCH 26, 2001 is made by and between INTERMET
CORPORATION, a Georgia corporation having its principal place of business in
Troy, Michigan (the "Company"), and TERRY GRAESSLE (the "Executive").

WHEREAS, the Company desires the services of the Executive, and the Executive is

WHEREAS, in order to secure the continued services of the Executive, the Company
believes it should provide the Executive with an agreement for severance

NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

                      Article 1 - Termination of Employment

     immediately after the Date of Termination that portion of the Executive's
     then current annual base salary which is accrued but unpaid as of such Date
     of Termination. The Executive will not be entitled to receive any other
     compensation or benefits under this Agreement.

1.2  Termination of Employment for Death or Disability. If, before the end of
     the Contract Term, the Executive's employment terminates due to death or
     Disability, the Company shall pay to the Executive (or to the Executive's
     estate), in accordance with Company policy following the Date of
     Termination:

(a)  that portion of the Executive's annual base salary which is accrued but
     unpaid as of the Date of Termination;

(b)  the amount of any Annual Bonus applicable to any Annual Bonus Period which
     ended prior to the Date of Termination, but which is unpaid as of the Date

(c)  disability, life insurance, and other benefits as typically provided to an
     executive under the Company's employee welfare benefit plans as a result of
     such an executive's death or Disability; and

(d)  a pro rata portion of the Annual Bonus applicable to the Annual Bonus
     Period during which the Date of Termination occurs based upon actual
     performance for the Annual Bonus Period (such pro rata bonus shall be based
     on the portion of such Annual Bonus Period that expired prior to the Date
     of Termination, shall be payable following such Annual Bonus Period in
     accordance with Company policy and shall be determined without regard to
     any reduction in earnings on account of interest

     paid on additional debt incurred by the Company in connection with any
     Change in Control).

1.3  Termination of Employment By the Company Without Cause or By the Executive
     for Good Reason (other than following a Change of Control). If, before the
     end of the Contract Term, unless such event follows a Change of Control,
     the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by
     the Executive for Good Reason (as that term is defined in the following
     Section 1.4), the Executive shall receive the following:

(a)  In a lump sum, that portion of the Executive's annual base salary which is
     accrued but unpaid as of the Date of Termination and any unpaid Annual
     Bonus applicable to any Annual Bonus Period which ended prior to the Date
     of Termination;

(b)  In monthly payments, the amount of the Executive's annual base salary (not
     taking into account any reductions which would constitute Good Reason)
     which would be payable for the period beginning on the Date of Termination
     and ending on the date that is one (1) year following the Date of
     Termination;

(c)  Following the Annual Bonus Period during which the Date of Termination
     occurs and in accordance with Company policy, a pro rata portion of the
     Annual Bonus applicable to such Annual Bonus Period based upon actual
     performance for the Annual Bonus Period (such pro rata bonus shall be based
     on the portion of such Annual Bonus Period that expired prior to the Date
     of Termination, shall be payable following such Annual Bonus Period in
     accordance with Company policy and shall be determined without regard to
     any reduction in earnings on account of interest paid on additional debt
     incurred by the Company in connection with any Change in Control); and

(d)  During the period in which the Executive is receiving the payments set
     forth in subsection 1.3(b) above, the employee benefits to which the

     of a Company vehicle. The Executive will not be entitled to participate in
     the Company's 401(k) plan, employee stock ownership plan, or similar
     retirement savings plan following the Date of Termination. The amount of
     any employee benefits payable under this Section 1.3(d) and the use of the
     Company vehicle shall be reduced or eliminated to the extent the Executive
     becomes entitled to duplicative benefits by virtue of his/her subsequent
     employment after the Date of Termination.

1.4  For purposes of the foregoing Section 1.3, the term "Good Reason" means the
     occurrence of any one of the following events:

(a)  assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent with the
     Executive's current position (or such other position to which he/she may
     have been promoted), or any other action that results in a material and
     adverse change in the




                                       3
<PAGE>
     Executive's position, status, title or responsibilities, provided, however,
     that (i) a change of title or change in reporting relationship that does
     not otherwise result in a material diminution of status or
     responsibilities, or (ii) a change that results in the Executive not
     serving as a member of the Company's highest level executive committee
     (currently designated as the Company's Operating Committee) will not
     constitute Good Reason,

(b)  the failure of the Company to assign this Agreement to a successor to the
     Company,

(c)  any reduction in the Executive's annual base salary or any change in the

     Control, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without
     Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason (as that term is defined in the
     following Section 1.6), the Executive shall receive the following:

(a)  In a lump sum, that portion of the Executive's annual base salary which is

     Bonus applicable to any Annual Bonus Period which ended prior to the Date
     of Termination;

(b)  In monthly payments, the amount of the Executive's annual base salary (not
     taking into account any reductions which would constitute Good Reason)
     which would be payable for the period beginning on the Date of Termination
     and ending on the date that is two (2) years following the Date of
     Termination;

(c)  Following the Annual Bonus Period during which the Date of Termination
     occurs and in accordance with Company policy, a pro rata portion of the
     Annual Bonus applicable to such Annual Bonus Period based upon actual
     performance for the Annual Bonus Period (such pro rata bonus shall be based
     on the portion of such Annual Bonus Period that expired prior to the Date
     of Termination, shall be payable following such Annual Bonus Period in
     accordance with Company policy and shall be determined without regard to
     any reduction in earnings on account of interest paid on additional debt
     incurred by the Company in connection with any Change in Control); and

     similar retirement savings plan following the Date of Termination. The
     amount of any employee benefits payable under this Section 1.5(d) shall be
     reduced or eliminated to the extent the Executive becomes entitled to
     duplicative benefits by virtue of his/her subsequent employment after the
     Date of Termination.

     occurrence of any one of the following events:

                                       5
<PAGE>
     substantially equivalent to the benefits provided under the Company's
     current annual bonus plan, provided, however, that the Company shall

     Executive remains employed; and, provided further, that notwithstanding

(3)  any act or omission with respect to which a determination could properly
     have been made that the Executive met the applicable standard of conduct

     which the Company is governed, in each case in effect at the time of such

(a)  any "person" (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and as used in Sections 13(d)(3)
     and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes a "beneficial owner" (as
     defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of
     securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting
     power of the Company's then outstanding securities eligible to vote for the
     election of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Voting
     Securities") provided, however, that the event described in this paragraph
     shall not be deemed to be a Change in Control by virtue of any of the
     following acquisitions: (i) by the Company or, direct or indirect,
     majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, (ii) by any employee benefit
     plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled
     by the Company, (iii) by any underwriter temporarily holding securities
     pursuant to an offering of such securities, (iv) pursuant to a Non-Control
     Transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)), (v) pursuant to any acquisition
     by the Executive or any group of persons including the Executive, or (vi)
     in which Company Voting Securities are acquired from the Company, if a
     majority of the Board of Directors of the Company approves a resolution
     providing expressly that the acquisition pursuant to this clause (vi) does
     not constitute a Change in Control under this paragraph (a);

(b)  individuals who, on MARCH 26, 2001, constitute the Board of Directors of
     the Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at
     least a majority thereof, provided that (i) any person becoming a director
     subsequent to MARCH 26, 2001, whose election, or nomination for election,
     by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least
     three-quarters of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board (either by a
     specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which
     such person is named as a nominee for director, without objection to such
     nomination) shall be, for purposes of this paragraph (b), considered as
     though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; Provided however,
     that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the
     Company as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
     respect to directors or any other actual or threatened solicitation of
     proxies or consents by or on behalf of any person other than the Board of
     Directors shall be deemed to be a member of the Incumbent Board;

(c)  the consummation of a merger or consolidation or similar form of corporate
     reorganization, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
     the assets, of the Company (a "Business Combination") is consummated,
     unless immediately following such Business Combination: (i) more than 50%
     of the total voting power of the corporation resulting from such Business
     Combination (including, without limitation, for purposes of making such 50%
     determination, any shares owned through any entity which directly or
     indirectly has beneficial ownership of the Company Voting Securities or all
     or substantially all of the Company's assets) eligible to elect directors
     of such corporation is represented by shares held by shareholders of the
     Company immediately prior to such Business Combination (either by remaining
     outstanding or being converted), (ii) no person (other than any




                                       7
<PAGE>
     holding company resulting from such Business Combination, any employee
     benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company (or the corporation
     resulting from such Business Combination), or any person which beneficially
     owned, immediately prior to such Business Combination, directly or
     indirectly, 30% or more of the Company Voting Securities) becomes the
     beneficial owner, directly or indirectly of 30% or more of the total voting
     power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of
     the corporation resulting from such Business Combination, and (iii) at
     least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
     corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the
     Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or
     action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Business Combination
     (a "Non-Control Transaction"); or

(d)  the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or
     dissolution of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur
solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 30% of the
Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Company Voting
Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Company Voting
Securities outstanding, increases the percentage of shares beneficially owned by
such person; provided, that if a Change in Control would occur as a result of
such an acquisition by the Company (if not for the operation of this sentence),
and after the Company's acquisition such person becomes the beneficial owner of
additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of
outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, then a
Change in Control shall occur.

2.8  "Good Reason" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1.4 or 1.6, as
     the case may be.

                        Article 3 - Restrictive Covenants

3.1  Trade Secrets. Confidential and Proprietary Business Information

(a)  The Company has advised the Executive and the Executive acknowledges that
     it is the policy of the Company to maintain as secret and confidential all
     Protected Information (as defined below), and that Protected Information
     has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the
     Company. "Protected Information" means trade secrets, confidential and
     proprietary business information of the Company, any information of the
     Company other than information which has entered the public domain (unless
     such information entered the public domain through the efforts of or on
     account of the Executive), and all valuable and unique information and
     techniques acquired, developed or used by the Company relating to its
     business, operations, employees and customers, which give the Company a
     competitive advantage over those who do not know the information and
     techniques and which are protected by the Company from unauthorized
     disclosure, including but not limited to, customer lists (including
     potential customers), sources of supply




                                       8
<PAGE>
     processes, plans, materials, pricing information, internal memoranda,
     marketing plans, internal policies, and products and services which may be
     developed from time to time by the Company and its agents or employees.

(b)  The Executive acknowledges that the Executive will acquire Protected
     Information with respect to the Company and its successors in interest,
     which information is valuable, special and a unique asset of the Company's
     business and operations and that disclosure of such Protected Information
     would cause irreparable damage to the Company.

(c)  The Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish or make
     accessible to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity
     (otherwise than as may be required in the regular course of the Executive's
     employment) nor use in any manner, either during or after termination of
     employment by the Company any Protected Information or cause any such
     information of the Company to enter the public domain.

3.2  Non-Competition.

(a)  The Executive agrees that the Executive shall not during the Executive's
     employment with the Company, and, if the Executive's employment is
     terminated for any reason other than termination of employment without
     Cause or for Good Reason, thereafter for a period of one (1) year directly
     or indirectly, in any capacity, engage or participate in or become employed
     by or render advisory or consulting or other services in connection with
     any Prohibited Business as defined below.

(b)  The Executive agrees that if the Executive's employment is terminated
     without Cause or for Good Reason, thereafter during the period in which the
     Executive is receiving payments under either Section 1.3(b) or 1.5(b)
     hereof, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, engage or participate in
     or become employed by or render advisory or consulting or other services in
     connection with any Prohibited Business as defined below.

(c)  Notwithstanding Section 3.2(b) above, at any time during which the
     Executive is receiving the payments and benefits due the Executive pursuant
     to Sections 1.3(b) and 1.3(d), or Sections 1.5(b) and 1.5(d), as the case
     may be, the Executive may elect by written notice to the Company to forego
     and release the Company from paying such payments and providing such
     benefits. From and after the date of such notice (i) the Company shall have
     no further obligation to make such payments or provide such benefits, and
     (ii) the obligation of the Executive set forth in Section 3.2(b) shall
     terminate.


(d)  The Executive agrees that the Executive shall not during the Executive's
     employment with the Company, and, if the Executive's employment is
     terminated for any reason, thereafter for a period of one (1) year, make
     any financial investment,



                                       9
<PAGE>
     whether in the form of equity or debt, or own any interest, directly or
     indirectly, in any Prohibited Business. Nothing in this Section 7.02 shall,
     however, restrict the Executive from making any investment in any Company
     whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded
     in the over-the-counter market; provided that (i) such investment does not
     give the Executive the right or ability to control or influence the policy
     decisions of any Prohibited Business, and (ii) such investment does not
     create a conflict of interest between the Executive's duties hereunder and
     the Executive's interest in such investment.

(e)  "Prohibited Business" shall be defined as any business and any branch,
     office or operation thereof, which is a direct and material competitor of
     the Company wherever the Company does business, in the United States or
     abroad, and which has established or seeks to establish contact, in
     whatever form (including but not limited to solicitation of sales, or the
     receipt or submission of bids) with any entity who is at any time a client,
     customer or supplier of the Company (including but not limited to all
     subdivisions of the federal government).

3.3  Undertaking Regarding Employees. From the date hereof until two years after
     the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not, directly or
     indirectly, (a) encourage any employee of the Company or its successors in
     interest to leave their employment with the Company or its successors in
     interest; or (b) employ, hire, solicit or cause to be employed or hired or
     solicited (other than by the Company or its successors in interest), or
     establish a business with, or encourage others to hire, any person who
     within two (2) years prior thereto was employed by the Company or its
     successors in interest.

3.4  Disclosure of Employee-Created Trade Secrets. Confidential and Proprietary
     Business Information. The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the
     Company all Protected Information developed in whole or in part by the
     Executive during the Executive's employment with the Company and which
     relate to the Company's business. Such Protected Information is, and shall
     remain, the exclusive property of the Company. All writings created during
     the Executive's employment with the Company (excluding writings unrelated
     to the Company's business) are considered to be "works-for-hire" for the
     benefit of the Company and the Company shall own all rights in such
     writings.
