                           Re: Amendment Number Seven
                    to Financing Agreement and Loan Documents

TWIN LABORATORIES INC.

Hauppauge, New York 11788

Gentlemen:

      Reference is made to the Financing Agreement between The CIT
Group/Business Credit, Inc. as lender and agent thereunder ("Agent"), the other
lenders party thereto ("Lenders"), and Twin Laboratories Inc. ("Twinlab") and
certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers thereunder (collectively, the
"Companies"), dated as of March 29, 2001 (as amended and modified, from time to
time, the "Financing Agreement"). Initially capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Financing Agreement.

      As of the date of this Amendment, Twinlab is repaying $5,000,000 of
outstanding Revolving Loans with the proceeds from the sale by Bronson of the
Acquired Assets (as such term is defined in that certain Consent Letter, dated
January 17, 2003, from the Agent to Bronson and Bronson Nutritionals, LLC (the
"Consent")), and the aggregate commitment of the Lenders under the Financing
Agreement is being reduced by such amount.

      In light of the forgoing, Agent, Lenders and the Companies wish to amend
certain provisions of the Loan Documents.

      Therefore, pursuant to mutual agreement, it is hereby agreed as follows:

            I. AMENDMENT TO CLAUSE (D) OF THE DEFINITION OF AVAILABILITY
RESERVE. Clause (d) of the definition of "Availability Reserve" set forth in
Section 1 of the Financing Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

             "(d) $5,000,000, throughout the term hereof unless otherwise agreed
      by Agent, in its discretion;"

      II. AMENDMENT TO DEFINITION OF EBITDA. The definition of "EBITDA" set
forth in Section 1 of the Financing Agreement is hereby amended to read as
follows:

            "EBITDA shall mean, in any period, all consolidated earnings of the
      Companies and their consolidated Subsidiaries before all (i) interest and
      tax obligations, (ii) depreciation, and (iii) amortization for said
      period, all determined in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with
      the latest audited financial statements of the Companies, but excluding
      (a) the effect of extraordinary and/or non-reoccurring gains or losses for
      such period, (b) for the period commencing September 1, 2002 through
      December 31, 2002, reclamation charges to the extent actually recorded in
      an amount not to exceed $8,800,000, and (c) for the period commencing
      January 1, 2002 through November 30, 2002, Restructuring Charges, to the
      extent actually recorded, in an amount not to exceed $19,500,000, and for
      the period commencing December 1, 2002 through March 31, 2004,
      Restructuring Charges, to the extent actually recorded, in an amount not
      to exceed $4,000,000."

      III. AMENDMENT TO DEFINITION OF LINE OF CREDIT. The definition of "Line of
Credit" set forth in Section 1 of the Financing Agreement is hereby amended to
read as follows:

            "LINE OF CREDIT shall mean the aggregate commitment of the Lenders
      to (a) make Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 3 of this Financing
      Agreement, (b) assist any of the Companies in opening Letters of Credit
      pursuant to Section 14 of this Financing Agreement, and (c) make the Term
      Loan pursuant to Section 4 of this Financing Agreement, in the aggregate
      amount equal to $45,000,000, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed
      to increase any Lender's commitment hereunder, which commitment shall be
      set forth opposite such Lender's name on the signature pages hereof, or in
      the Assignment and Transfer Agreement executed by such Lender by which it
      becomes a Lender hereunder, as such pro rata share may be adjusted
      pursuant to Assignment and Transfer Agreements executed pursuant to
      Section 12.9 hereof."

      IV. AMENDMENT TO ADD DEFINITION OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. A new definition
of "Restructuring Charges" is hereby added to Section 1 of the Financing
Agreement and shall read as follows:

            "RESTRUCTURING CHARGES shall mean, on a consolidated basis for the
      Companies and their consolidated Subsidiaries, all (i) asset impairment
      charges; (ii) severance and related benefits payable to any of the
      Blechmans; (iii) professional fees; (iv) rents; (v) clean up costs,

      V. AMENDMENT OF SECTION 6.11(A). Section 6.11(a) of the Financing
Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

                  "(a) maintain at the end of each month, on a rolling, trailing
      12-month basis, EBITDA of not less than the amounts set forth below for
