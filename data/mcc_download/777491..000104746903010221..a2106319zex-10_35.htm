under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of the Participant's employment by the Company, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company,
subject to the terms of any separate employment agreement, at any time to terminate such employment or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the
time of the election. Nothing in this Plan shall limit or impair the Company's right to terminate the employment of any employee. Whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or
government service, shall constitute a termination of employment shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Participation in this Plan is a matter entirely separate from any pension
right or entitlement the Participant may have and from the terms or conditions of the Participant's employment. Participation in this Plan shall not affect in any way a Participant's pension rights or
entitlements or terms or conditions of employment. Any Participant who leaves the employment of the Company shall not be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or any benefit or
prospective right or benefit under this Plan which the Participant might otherwise have enjoyed whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful dismissal or other breach of
contract or by way of compensation for loss of office or otherwise. </FONT></P>
