contains provisions for the acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the
happening of certain events, for optional or mandatory prepayments of the
principal hereof prior to the maturity thereof, for a higher rate of interest
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and for certain security interests
granted by the Borrower and certain related entities. Reference is made to the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents for a statement of the terms and
conditions under which the Revolving Credit Loans evidenced hereby have been
secured.

                  Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of
