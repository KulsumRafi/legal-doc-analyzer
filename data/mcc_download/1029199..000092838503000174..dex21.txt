5.   WARRANTIES

5.1  The Seller, upon the execution of this Agreement, warrants to the Buyer in
     the terms of the Warranties. The Seller acknowledges that the Warranties
     are incorporated into this Agreement.

5.2  Each Warranty is given subject only to matters disclosed in the Disclosure
     Letter. The provisions of Schedule 4 shall apply to limit liability under
     the Warranties as set out in clause 5.8 below. For this purpose, and for
     all purposes under this Agreement, the expression "disclosed" means
     disclosed in such a manner as is required by English law to make such
     disclosure effective.

     deemed disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, no fact, matter, event or
     circumstance of which the Buyer has knowledge (actual or constructive)
     shall prejudice any claim made by the Buyer under the Warranties or operate
     to reduce any amount recoverable. The Buyer confirms to the Seller that it
     is not aware of any matter or thing which based on the Buyer's current
     knowledge of such matter or thing could give rise to a claim under the
     Warranties.

5.4  The Warranties shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
     Completion.

                                       10

<PAGE>

5.5  Each Warranty shall be separate and independent and, save as expressly
     provided, shall not be limited by reference to any other Warranty or any
     other provision in this Agreement.

5.6  Where any statement in the Warranties is qualified by the expression "to
     the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the Seller" or "so far
     as the Seller is aware" or any similar expression, the Seller shall be
     deemed to have knowledge of anything of which any of Jeffrey Newman, Janusz
     Diemko, Ron Delnevo, Debbie Smyth and Paul Hughes has actual knowledge.

5.7  The Seller confirms to the Buyer that it has made due and careful enquiry
     (including, without limitation, due and careful enquiry of Jeffrey Newman,
     Janusz Diemko, Ron Delnevo, Debbie Smyth and Paul Hughes to establish the
     truth of each Warranty and the Seller agrees to disclose to the Buyer in
     writing, immediately upon its becoming aware of the same, full details of
     any fact or circumstance which renders or might render untrue or misleading
     any Warranty.

5.8  Any claim under the Warranties shall be limited in accordance with the
     provisions of Schedule 4 provided that none of the provisions in Schedule 4
     shall apply if the Seller fraudulently, dishonestly, or deliberately makes
     or omits to make a disclosure in the Disclosure Letter in such a way as to
     render the relevant Warranties (when read with the Disclosure Letter)
     untrue or misleading.

5.9  The Seller agrees with the Buyer:

     5.9.1  that save as agreed in the Comfort Letters the giving by the Company
            and/or any of its officers, employees, agents or advisers (past or
            present) to the Seller or its agents or advisers (past or present)
            of any information or opinion in connection with the Warranties or
            the Tax Deed or the Disclosure Letter or otherwise in relation to
            the business or affairs of the Company or in connection with the
            negotiation and preparation of this Agreement, the Tax Deed or the
            Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be a representation,
            warranty or guarantee to the Seller of the accuracy of such
            information or opinion;

     5.9.2  save as agreed in the Comfort Letters to waive any right or claim
            which it may have against the Company and/or any of its

                                       11

<PAGE>

            officers, employees, agents or advisers for any error, omission or
            misrepresentation in any such information or opinion; and

     5.9.3  that any such right or claim shall not constitute a defence to any
            claim by the Buyer under or in relation to this Agreement (including
            the Warranties) or the Tax Deed.

6.   PROTECTION OF GOODWILL

6.1  The Seller undertakes to the Buyer to procure that:

     6.1.1  no member of the Retained Group shall for a period of 12 months
            following Completion, enter into or perform (either directly or
            indirectly) any agreement with a bank or building society in the
            United Kingdom under which it provides ATM management or operation
            services with respect to less than 75 ATM locations. It shall not be
            a violation of this provision for any member of the Retained Group
            to provide ATM management and operation services to independent
            owners/operators of ATMs (including, without limitation, Moneybox
            and TRM) or to banks or building societies when Euronet's agreement
            with such bank or building society covers more than 75 ATM locations
            which are operational at the date the agreement is entered into; and

     6.1.2  no member of the Retained Group shall for a period of 36 months
            following Completion, engage in any "Independent ATM Network
            Business," as defined below, in the United Kingdom. In this
            Agreement "Independent ATM Network Business" shall mean owning and
            commercially exploiting off-branch ATMs. The ownership and
            commercial exploitation of ATMs under, or as a result of, any
            agreement for outsourced ATM management or operation services
            between any member of the Retained Group and a bank, building
            society or independent owner/operator of ATMs which is not
            prohibited by 6.1.1 above shall not fall within the definition of
            Independent ATM Network Business.

6.2  The Seller acknowledges that the Company is in a position to provide many
     of the services required locally in the United Kingdom ("Local Services")
     by the Retained Group to provide ATM services to banks and building
     societies in the United Kingdom ("Euronet UK Customers"). The Company shall
     for a period of 36 months following Completion be offered the right to
     match

                                       12

<PAGE>

       competitive quotes offered to the Retained Group for the provision of
       Local Services under contracts to be entered into with Euronet UK
       Customers, and if the Company is able to match such quotes the Company
       shall be selected as the provider of Local Services. For the purposes of
       the previous sentence, the Company shall be considered to have matched a
       competitive quote if it is able to provide (utilising its resources in
       existence at the time the competitive quote is notified to it) the full
       range of services proposed to be provided by the other potential
       provider, in accordance with performance and technical standards that are
       at least as high as those offered, and at prices that are as favourable,
       taking into account any and all discounts or other elements of
       consideration being offered by the other providers to Euronet. This
       agreement shall not apply to any Local Services if the Retained Group
       provides such Local Services through its own group employees nor shall it
       apply if any member of the Retained Group proposes to enter into an
       arrangement or obtain Local Services from any other provider if such
       arrangement is required for any reason by a Euronet UK Customer as part
       of an arms length negotiation. In addition this provision shall not apply
       to any commercial agreement to be entered into with a manufacturer of
       ATMs where such agreement includes the sale of hardware or software. The
       following additional provision apply with respect to this clause 6.2:

       6.2.1   Within 5 days of receiving the quote, the relevant member of the
               Retained Group will give the Company written notice under Section
               6.2 that it has received a competitive quote negotiated at arms
               length to obtain Local Services from a provider in the UK, and
               the Company shall have a period of 15 days, within which to
               confirm that it is interested in providing such Local Services
               and provide the relevant member of the Retained Group with a
               matching quote. If the Company does not provide the relevant
               member of the Retained Group with such response within 15 days,
               the relevant member of the Retained Group may consider that the
               Company cannot or is not willing to match such competitive quote.

       6.2.2   During the conduct of the procedures set forth in Section 6.2 and
               for a period of 12 months thereafter, the Company shall not and
               shall procure that none of the Buyer's Group nor Bridgepoint
               Capital Limited nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall
               approach any of the Retained Group's proposed commercial partners
               in the transaction underlying any notice given by the relevant
               member of the Retained Group to the Company

                                       13

<PAGE>


               hereunder in connection with such transactions.

6.3    The Seller undertakes to the Buyer that it will not, directly or
       indirectly:

       6.3.1   at any time prior to or during the period of 36 months from the
               Completion Date, solicit the custom of or deal with any bank or
               building society in the United Kingdom with which the Company
               had, prior to the Completion Date provided or prepared to provide
               ATM management or operation services with respect to less than 75
               ATM locations or any such bank or building society who had any
               dealings with the Company at any time during the period of 18
               months prior to the Completion Date so as to compete with, or
               harm the goodwill of, the Company;

       6.3.2   at any time prior to or during the period of 36 months from the
               Completion Date, interfere or endeavour to interfere with the
               continuance of supplies to the Company (or the terms relating to
               those supplies) by any person who at any time during the period
               of 18 months prior to the Completion Date was a supplier of any
               goods or services to the Company; or

       6.3.3   at any time prior to or during the period of 36 months from the
               Completion Date, solicit or entice away, or endeavour to solicit
               or entice away, from the Company any person who was at the
               Completion Date, or who at any time during the period of 18
               months prior to the Completion Date had been, a senior employee
               of the Company whether or not such person would commit a breach
               of his employment contract by reason of leaving service, save
               that this clause shall not apply to any employee employed by the
               Company in a non-managerial or non-technical or purely
               administrative role.

6.4    Nothing contained in clause 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 shall prevent the Seller from
       holding by way of bona fide personal investment any units of any
       authorised unit trust and from being the holder or beneficial owner of
       any class of securities in any company if such class of securities is
       listed, or dealt in, on a Recognised Investment Exchange provided that it
       neither holds nor is beneficially interested in more than a total of 1%
       of any single class of the securities in that company.

                                       14

<PAGE>

6.5    Each of the undertakings contained in clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 is a
       separate undertaking by the Seller and shall be enforceable by the Buyer
       separately and independently of its right to enforce any one or more of
       the other covenants contained in clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4. If any such
       undertaking shall be found to be void but would be valid if some part
       were deleted, then such undertaking shall apply with such deletions as
       may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

6.6    For the purposes of clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4, "directly or indirectly"
       shall (without limiting the expression) mean the Seller acting either
       alone or jointly with or on behalf of any other person whether as
       principal, partner, manager, employee, contractor, director, consultant,
       investor (subject to clause 6.4) or otherwise.

7.     CONFIDENTIALITY

The Seller shall (and shall procure that each other member of the Retained Group
shall) in all respects keep confidential and not at any time disclose or make
known in any other way to anyone whomsoever or use for its own or any other
person's benefit or to the detriment of the Company any Confidential
Information, provided that:

7.1    such obligation shall not apply to information which becomes generally
       known (other than through a breach by the Seller of this clause);

7.2    the Seller shall be entitled at all times to disclose such information as
       may be required by law or by any competent judicial or regulatory
       authority including the SEC, or by any Recognised Investment Exchange
       (provided that, so far as practicable, the Seller shall consult with the
       Buyer prior to making such disclosure); and

7.3    the Seller shall be entitled to disclose to its officers, employees,
       agents or advisers such information as may be necessary to enable them to

       information confidential for as long as the Seller is obliged to do so in
       accordance with this clause).

               its obligations (the "Obligations") under this Agreement and any
               other agreement or arrangement required to be entered into by it
               and/or any other member of the Retained Group in connection with

               any law, regulation or order. In each such case (a) every

               arrangement and any part of the Obligations are transferred to
               any other person, the provisions of clauses 12.2 to 12.5 shall,

3.     FINANCIAL LIMITS

       Threshold for Relevant Claims

3.1    No liability shall attach to the Seller in respect of a Relevant Claim
       (other than a claim under the Tax Deed) unless the aggregate amount of
       liabilities of the Seller in respect of all Relevant Claims (other than a
       claim under the Tax Deed) (excluding reasonable legal costs and any other
       costs and expenses incurred in ascertaining the existence or the amount
       of such Relevant Claims ("Relevant Costs")) shall exceed the total sum of
       (pounds)312,500 (the "Threshold") and if the aggregate amount of such
       liabilities shall exceed the Threshold the Seller shall be liable for the
       whole of such aggregate amount and not merely for the amount in excess of
       the Threshold.

3.2    Relevant Claims in the amount of (pounds)3,125 or less (excluding
       Relevant Costs) shall be deemed not to be Relevant Claims and accordingly
       no liability whatsoever shall attach to the Seller in respect of such
       Relevant Claims. Where more than one Relevant Claim arises out of the
       same facts or circumstances all such claims shall be aggregated together
       for the purposes of this paragraph 3.2.

       Ceiling on Relevant Claims

3.3    The aggregate liability of the Seller to make payment to the Buyer in
       respect of all or any Relevant Claim(s) shall not in any circumstances
       exceed (pounds)20,312,500 (excluding Relevant Costs), and accordingly the
       Seller shall not be liable for Relevant Claims in excess of such amount.

4.     DOUBLE CLAIMS

4.1    If the Buyer is entitled to claim under the Tax Deed or under the
       Warranties in respect of the same subject matter, the Buyer may choose to
       claim under either or both but payments under the Tax Deed shall pro
       tanto satisfy and discharge any Warranty Claim in respect of the same
       subject matter and vice versa.

4.2    The Buyer shall not be entitled to recover the damages or obtain
       reimbursement or restitution or payment from the Seller to the extent it
       has already recovered in respect of a particular fact, circumstance,
       matter, event or thing constituting or giving rise to a Relevant Claim.

5.     DISCLOSURE

       The Buyer shall not be entitled to claim that any fact, circumstance,
       matter, event or thing constitutes or gives rise to a Relevant Claim
       (other than a claim under the Tax Deed), if such fact, circumstance,
       matter, event or thing has been disclosed by this Agreement (or arises
       from the implementation of this Agreement), including any of the
       Schedules, or in the Disclosure Letter.

6.     SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS

               referred to in the notes to the 2002 Audited Accounts;

       6.1.2   it would not have arisen but for any change after Completion in
               the accounting principles or practices of the Company or in
               generally accepted accounting principles;

       6.1.3   it occurs as a result of:-

               (a)  any legislation or practice of any governmental authority or

                    or omission occurs:-

                    (i)    as part of the Company's ordinary course of business;
                           or

                    (ii)   pursuant to a legally binding obligation of the

                    (iii)  with the written approval of the Seller.

6.2    If any liability of the Seller is in respect of a liability of the
       Company which is contingent when the Relevant Claim (other than a claim
       under the Tax Deed) is notified to the Seller, the Seller shall not be
       obliged to make any payment in respect of the liability until such time
       as the contingent liability becomes an actual liability.

6.3    The specific exclusions and limitations set out in clause 3 of the Tax
       Deed will apply to all Tax Claims.

7.     NOTICE OF CLAIMS AND PROCEDURE

7.1    If after Completion there comes to the notice of the Buyer or the
       Company, any matter or claim or event or thing which may constitute or

               Claim to the Seller giving details of the Warranty Claim so far
               as then known to the Buyer or the Company, including the nature
               of the claim and the circumstances giving rise to it, together
               with the Buyer's bona fide estimate of any alleged loss and
               assessment of the amount that and the date on which the Buyer
               anticipates that

                                       75

<PAGE>

               the Seller will be required to make a payment in respect of the
               Warranty Claim and any Relevant Claim;

       7.1.2   not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise with
               any person, body or authority in relation to the Warranty Claim
               without the prior agreement of the Seller (which shall not be
               unreasonably withheld or delayed);

       7.1.3   give the Seller and their professional advisers access to the
               premises, personnel and advisers of the Buyer and the Company, as

               access so as to enable the Seller and their professional advisers
               to examine such chattels, accounts, documents and records and
               take extracts or photocopies of them for the purpose of
               determining the nature and extent of the Warranty Claim (and any
               related Relevant Claim) and the steps that may be appropriate to
               remedy or avert it.

7.2    Following the Buyer giving notice to the Seller of a Warranty Claim, the
       Buyer shall take such reasonable steps as the Seller considers desirable
       to remedy or avert the Warranty Claim or any related Relevant Claim.

7.3    The Seller may require the Buyer to take such action and give such
       information and assistance in connection with the affairs of the Buyer or
       the Company and as the Seller may reasonably request to avoid, resist,
       appeal or compromise the Warranty Claim subject to the Seller
       indemnifying the Buyer for itself and as trustee for the Company against
       all costs and expenses which it or they may properly incur in connection
       with such assistance.

       reasonably request to enforce such recovery and any amount so recovered
       shall be take into account in determining the liability of the Seller in
       respect of any related Relevant Claim.

8.   MITIGATION

     Nothing in this Schedule shall in any way restrict or limit the general

     damage which it may suffer in consequence of any breach by the Seller of
     the terms of this Agreement.

9.   NO RESCISSION: REMEDY IN DAMAGES

     The Buyer shall have no right to rescind or terminate this Agreement for
     any reason whatsoever. After Completion the Buyer's sole remedy for any
     breach by the Seller of any of the terms of this Agreement (including a
     Relevant Claim) or under the provisions of the Misrepresentation Act 1967
     shall be against the Seller in damages and any such remedy shall be subject
     to the limitation contained in this Agreement.

10.  REDUCTION IN CONSIDERATION

     Payments made by the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall
     constitute a repayment of and a reduction in the consideration for the
     Shares.

11.  THIRD PARTY RECOVERY

11.1 If, before the Seller has made a payment in respect of a Relevant Claim
     (other than a claim under the Tax Deed), the Buyer and/or the Company shall
     recover or be finally entitled to recover (whether by payment, discount,
     credit or otherwise including from insurers or any Taxation Authority) any
     sum by reason of or in respect of the matter giving rise to the Relevant
     claim the Buyer and/or the Company shall take such recovery (less any
     reasonable costs and expenses properly incurred in relation to such
     recovery) into account in determining the amount of the Relevant Claim.

11.2 If the Seller has made any payment of a Relevant Claim (other than a claim
     under the Tax Deed) and the Buyer and/or the Company subsequently receives
     a benefit which was not taken into account in determining any liability of
     the Seller in respect of the Relevant Claim and which would have reduced
     such liability had the benefit been taken into account (including under any
     insurance) the Buyer (for itself or on behalf of the relevant company as
     the case may be) shall immediately repay to the Seller an amount equal to
     the lesser of:-

                                       77

<PAGE>

     11.2.1    an amount corresponding to the benefit (including the amount of
               any such refund but, in all cases, after deduction of any
               reasonable costs or expenses properly incurred in such recovery
               as well as all Taxation on such amount); and

               Claim.

12.  GUARANTEES

     The following provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the guarantees,
     indemnities, undertakings and agreements listed in the Disclosure Letter
     ("Guarantees"). The Buyer shall procure the release of the Seller from the
     Guarantees as soon as reasonably practicable or by such later date as the
     Seller may in its absolute discretion agree. The Buyer undertakes to the
     Seller that it will indemnify the Seller and keep the Seller indemnified
     from and against any and all liability (including in respect of claims,
     proceedings, costs and interest) in relation to any claims made, or
     obligations arising, after Completion under or pursuant to any of the
     Guarantees. The Buyer agrees to use its best efforts to procure the release
     of the Seller from any other guarantees, indemnities, undertakings and
     agreements to the extent they relate to the Company subject to being
     satisfactorily indemnified by the Seller in respect of any cost associated
     with such efforts.

13.  TAX DEED

     If any limits on the liability of the Seller under the Tax Deed conflict
     with the provisions of this Schedule then the provisions of the Tax Deed
     shall prevail.

     upon any representation or promise other than the Warranties.

                            CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT

                         PART I - 2002 AUDITED ACCOUNTS

1.     The Seller shall procure that draft 2002 Audited Accounts and Statement
       of Working Capital Value are prepared as soon as practicable following 31
       December 2002 and, in any event, by no later than 31 March 2003.

2.     Except as otherwise agreed in Part III of this Schedule 7, the draft 2002
       Audited Accounts shall exclude any effects of the changes in control or
       ownership contemplated by this Agreement, shall be prepared on the going
       concern basis and shall take no account of post balance sheet events or
       information occurring or becoming available after the delivery of the
       draft 2002 Audited Accounts by the Seller to the Buyer.

3.     The 2002 Audited Accounts shall be prepared on a basis which is
       consistent with the manner in, and the principles, bases and policies on
       which the Accounts were prepared and, in accordance with generally
       accepted accounting standards in England and Wales. The Buyer shall
       provide the Seller's Accountants with access to all documentation,
       information and data in or relating to the Company reasonably considered
       appropriate by the Seller's Accountants in order to prepare and audit the
       2002 Audited Accounts.

4.     When draft 2002 Audited Accounts have been prepared, the Seller shall
       promptly deliver a copy of the draft 2002 Audited Accounts and Statement
       of Working Capital Value to the Buyer for review.

5.     Within 15 Business Days after the Seller has delivered the draft 2002
       Audited Accounts to the Buyer, the parties shall procure that the
       Auditors and the Seller's Accountants meet to review the draft 2002
       Audited Accounts and to satisfy themselves that they have been duly
       prepared in accordance with this Agreement and that the Statement of
       Working Capital Value has been correctly stated. The Seller shall
       promptly provide, and render or cause the provision and rendering to the
       Buyer of such information and assistance as the Buyer may reasonably
       require for the purposes of agreeing the 2002 Audited Accounts and the
       Statement of Working Capital Value. The Buyer shall then, within 10
       Business Days following such meeting either:

                                       81

<PAGE>

       5.1      confirm in writing (a "Satisfaction Notice") to the Seller that
                they agree that the draft 2002 Audited Accounts have been duly
                prepared and that the Working Capital Value has been correctly
                stated; or

       5.2      give notice in writing (a "Dissatisfaction Notice") to the
                Seller explaining in reasonable detail why they are unable so to
                confirm.

6.     If the Buyer fails to give a Satisfaction Notice or a Dissatisfaction
       Notice when required, the draft 2002 Audited Accounts and the Statement
       of Working Capital Value shall be deemed to have been finally accepted
       and agreed by the Seller and the Buyer.

7.     If the Buyer gives a Dissatisfaction Notice the parties shall endeavour
       to resolve all matters in dispute as soon as is practicable.

8.     If the parties fail to resolve such matters within 10 Business Days of
       the date of the giving of the Dissatisfaction Notice (the "Resolution
       Period") any party may refer all matters in dispute for resolution to an
       independent chartered accountant (the "Accountant").

9.     The identity of the Accountant shall be agreed between the parties and he
       shall be appointed within five Business Days of the expiry of the
       Resolution Period (the "Appointment Period"). If there is a failure to
       appoint the Accountant within the Appointment Period, the Accountant
       shall be appointed by the President for the time being of the Institute
       of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales within five Business Days
       of the expiry of the Appointment Period, on the application of either the
       Buyer or the Seller.

10.    The Accountant shall be instructed to determine the dispute in accordance
       with the provisions of this Schedule 7 and to make such determination as
       soon as is practicable and, in any event, within 20 Business Days of his
       being instructed. In making such determination the Accountant shall act
       as an expert and not as an arbitrator and his decision shall (in the
       absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the parties.

11.    The costs of the Accountant shall be borne by the parties in the
       proportions the Accountant may direct or, in the absence of direction, as
       to one half by the Buyer and as to the other half by the Seller.

<PAGE>

                        PART II - CONSIDERATION RETENTION

1.     The Consideration Retention (together with any interest accrued in the
       Consideration Retention Account) shall be applied in accordance with the
       provisions of this Schedule 7 Part II.

2.     If the Working Capital Value is not more than (pounds)30,000 less than
       the Target Working Capital Value, the parties shall procure that the
       Consideration Retention is released to the Seller's Solicitors on the
       Consideration Retention Release Date provided that, if at such time an
       Agreed Claim or an Unagreed Claim remains unsatisfied in whole or in
       part, the provisions of paragraph 11 below shall apply.

3.     If the Working Capital Value is more than (pounds)30,000 less than the
       Target Working Capital Value, the parties shall procure that on the
       Consideration Retention Release Date:

       3.1      the Consideration Retention or, if less, an amount of the
                Consideration Retention equal to the amount of the Adjustment
                shall be released to the Buyer's Solicitors; and

       3.2      the residue (if any) of the Consideration Retention remaining
                (the "Released Amount") shall be released to the Seller's
                Solicitors,

       provided that, if at such time an Agreed Claim or an Unagreed Claim
       remains unsatisfied in whole or in part, the provisions of paragraph 11
       below shall apply.

4.     The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct the amount of any Agreed Claim
       from, the Consideration Retention or the Released Amount (as the case may
       be) prior to its release and any deduction shall pro tanto satisfy the
       liability concerned.

5.     If an Unagreed Claim is made prior to the release of the Consideration
       Retention or the Released Amount (as the case may be), the Buyer shall
       use all reasonable endeavours to quantify the maximum amount of such
       Unagreed Claim (if capable of estimation) and shall notify the Seller in
       writing of the estimated amount of such Unagreed Claim (the "Estimate")
       or of the fact that the same is incapable of estimation.

6.     If the maximum amount of any Unagreed Claim is so estimated, the parties
       shall procure that the amount (if any) by which the balance of the
       Consideration Retention or the Released Amount (as the case may be)

                                       83

<PAGE>

       exceeds the aggregate of the Estimates of all such Unagreed Claims shall
       be released to the Seller's Solicitors on the Consideration Retention
       Release Date (or, if later, within ten Business Days of the date on which
       the Estimate or, if more than one Unagreed Claim has been made, of the
       date on which the aggregate of the Estimates has been notified).

7.     If the maximum amount of any Unagreed Claim cannot be quantified, the
       Consideration Retention or the Released Amount (as the case may be) shall
       be held in the Consideration Retention Account until such time as all
       Unagreed Claims are finally settled or otherwise determined.

8.     Upon the final settlement or determination of all Unagreed Claims, the
       parties shall procure that the balance of the Consideration Retention or
       the Released Amount (as the case may be) shall immediately be applied in
       or towards the discharge of the amount agreed or determined to be payable
       to the Buyer in respect of all such Unagreed Claims and the residue (if
       any) remaining after the complete discharge of such Unagreed Claims shall
       be released to the Seller's Solicitors.

9.     The receipt of the Buyer's Solicitors or the Seller's Solicitors of any
       payment made out of the Consideration Retention Account shall be an
       absolute discharge of the paying party.

10.    The parties shall promptly give to the Seller's Solicitors and the
       Buyer's Solicitors all written instructions as shall be necessary to give
       effect to the provisions of this Schedule 7 Part II.

11.    Interest which accrues on the Consideration Retention Account shall
       follow the capital and be released to the party or parties entitled the
       capital contemporaneously with, and proportionately to, the release of
       the capital (subject to deduction of tax as required by law).

       Further Adjustment

12.    If, on the Consideration Retention Release Date, the amount of the
       Adjustment is greater than the amount of the Consideration Retention, the
       Seller shall, in addition to the release of that part of the
       Consideration Retention as is to be paid to the Buyer's Solicitors in
       accordance with paragraph 4, pay a cash amount equal to the Adjustment
       less the Consideration Retention to the Buyer's Solicitors and the
       receipt of the Buyer's Solicitors of such payment shall be an absolute
       discharge of the Seller.

                                       84

<PAGE>

13.    Each of the Parties agrees to pursue all matters relating to any Unagreed
       Claim promptly and with a view to resolving such matter as soon as
       reasonably practicable.
