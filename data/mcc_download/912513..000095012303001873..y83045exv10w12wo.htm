<DIV align="center"><FONT size="2">(as amended through December&nbsp;9, 2002)
</FONT></DIV>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. This Plan was originally adopted by the Company effective as of
January&nbsp;1, 1996 and was amended effective as of January&nbsp;21, 2002 and was
further amended effective as of December&nbsp;9, 2002. This Plan&#146;s purpose is to
allow the Company to avoid exceeding the Section&nbsp;162(m) Limits by providing for
the discretionary deferral of certain amounts that otherwise would be paid to
executives under the I. C. Plan
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferrals.
No later than June&nbsp;30 of each calendar
year (a &#147;Plan Year&#148;) commencing with the 2003 Plan Year, a Participant may
elect to defer any compensation paid to him in the year after such Plan Year
with respect to such Plan Year&#146;s performance that is in excess of the
deductible Section&nbsp;162(m) Limits as determined for such Plan Year by so
notifying the Secretary to the Committee. No deferral will be made pursuant to
this Plan for the 2003 Plan Year and subsequent years in the absence of such
election. With respect to the 2002 Plan Year, no deferral will be
made unless a Participant confirms that such deferral should be made
within 15&nbsp;days after December&nbsp;9, 2002, the date this
amendment was adopted. For the avoidance of doubt and by way of example, a Participant may
elect, on or before June&nbsp;30, 2003 to defer compensation payable in 2004
with respect to the 2003 Plan Year that is in excess of the deductible Section
162(m) Limits as computed for the 2003 Plan Year. Such deferrals were
automatic for the 2001 Plan Year and preceding years. Each Participant shall
have established in his/her name a Deferred Cash Account. If with respect to
any Plan Year of the Company (provided, with respect to the 2002 and subsequent
Plan Years, only if the Participant has timely made a deferral election with
respect to such Plan Year), the deductible
