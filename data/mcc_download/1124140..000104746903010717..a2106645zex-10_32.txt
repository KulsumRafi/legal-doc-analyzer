        quoted by THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Eastern Edition, on the last business
        day of each calendar quarter in which such payments are accrued.

        made when due will accrue interest beginning on the first day following
        the due date. The interest shall be compounded at the rate of one and
        one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month, compounded monthly until such
        overdue payment is received by APOGENT.

5.1     CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the Term, the Parties may exchange
        information from time to time that they consider to be confidential.
        "Confidential Information" hereunder shall, subject to Article 5.3, mean
        the substance of this Agreement and any information or materials that
        are disclosed by one Party (the "Discloser") to another Party (the
        "Recipient") whether orally, visually, or in tangible form, and all
        copies thereof. Tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential
        Information shall be marked by Discloser as "Confidential,"
        "Proprietary" or the substantial equivalent thereof. Confidential
        Information that is disclosed orally or visually shall be identified by
        Discloser as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a
        written summary by Discloser, which shall mark such summary as
        "Confidential," "Proprietary" or the substantial equivalent thereof, and
        deliver it to Recipient by the end of the month following the month in
        which disclosure occurs. Such information shall be treated as
        Confidential Information pending receipt of such summary.

5.2     TREATMENT OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Recipient of Confidential
        Information shall employ all reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy
        and confidentiality of such Confidential Information, such efforts to be
        no less than the degree of care employed by the Recipient to preserve
        and safeguard its own Confidential Information. The information shall
        not be disclosed or revealed to anyone except employees of the Recipient
        who have a need to know the information and who have entered into a
        secrecy agreement with the Recipient under which such employees are
        required to maintain confidential the proprietary information of the
        Recipient and such employees shall be advised by the Recipient of the
        confidential nature of the Confidential Information and that the
        Confidential Information shall be treated accordingly. Each Sublicensee
        shall be bound, as a Recipient, not to disclose the Confidential
        Information of APOGENT, whether such Confidential Information is
        provided by APOGENT or by EXACT;

                                     Page 5
<Page>

        and both the Sublicensee and EXACT shall be jointly and severally liable
        for any breach of such obligation by the Sublicensee.

5.3     EXCEPTIONS. The Recipient's obligations under this Article 5 shall not
        extend to any part of the information that:

                (i)   can be demonstrated to have been in the public domain or
                      publicly known prior to the date of the disclosure; or

                (ii)  can be demonstrated from written records to have been in
                      the Recipient's possession or readily available to the
                      Recipient from another source not under obligation of
                      secrecy to the Discloser prior to the disclosure; or

                (iii) becomes part of the public domain or publicly known other
                      than as a result of any unauthorized act by the Recipient;
                      or

                (iv)  is demonstrated from contemporaneous written records to
                      have been developed by or for the Recipient without
                      reference to confidential information disclosed by the
                      Discloser; or

                (v)   is required to be disclosed by law, government regulation
                      or court order.

        However, the exception set forth in Section 5.3(v) shall only apply if,
        prior to making any legally required disclosure of the Discloser's
        Confidential Information, the Recipient notifies the Discloser and
        affords the Discloser a reasonable opportunity to defend against or
        limit such required disclosure.

5.4     INJUNCTION. In view of the difficulties of placing a monetary value on
        the Confidential Information, the Discloser shall be entitled to a
        preliminary and final injunction without the necessity of posting any
        bond or undertaking in connection therewith to prevent further breach of
        this Article 5 or further unauthorized use of its Confidential
        Information. This remedy is separate from any other remedy the Discloser
        may have.

5.5     TREATMENT UPON TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT. Upon the expiration or
        termination, for any reason, of this Agreement, or upon the demand of
        the Discloser at any time, Recipient shall return promptly to Discloser
        or destroy, at Discloser's option, all tangible materials that disclose
        or embody Confidential Information of the Discloser.

8.1     NO OTHER WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY
        MAKES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED PRODUCTS AND DISCLAIMS
        ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THOSE

        FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE, TO THE EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

8.2     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER
        PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS ARISING
        UNDER OR CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

                       ARTICLE 9 - TECHNOLOGY EXCLUSIVITY

9.1     USE AND SUBLICENSING IN CONNECTION WITH [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
        REQUESTED]/*/ Commencing on the date on which any Result is first

<Page>

        [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ without relying on the Licensed
        Process. However, if EXACT [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ then
        the exclusive license granted pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be converted
        to a non-exclusive license. Similarly, commencing on the date on which
        any Result is first obtained for cash consideration and continuing
        throughout the Term, EXACT shall not [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
        REQUESTED]/*/ without also requiring such third-party to become a
        Sublicensee hereunder and license the Licensed Process on terms that do
        not materially differ from the terms of this Agreement.

                        ARTICLE 10 - TERM AND TERMINATION

10.1    TERM. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
        remain effective for a period of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/
        unless earlier terminated as provided by this Agreement (the "Term").
        This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for two successive periods
        of five years each (such renewal period also part of the "Term"), unless
        at least six months prior to the expiration of the then current Term or
        renewal Term, EXACT notifies APOGENT in writing of its desire to
        terminate this Agreement at the end of the then current Term or renewal
        Term. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for a
        successive periods of one year each (each such renewal period also part
        of the "Term"), unless at least six months prior to the expiration of
        the then current renewal Term, one party notifies the other in writing
        of its desire to terminate this Agreement at the end of the then current
        Term.

10.2    TERMINATION FOR BREACH. Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the
        other Party materially breaches its obligations hereunder, and such
        breach is not cured within sixty (60) days after written noticed thereof
        to such other Party.

10.3    EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Upon early termination of this Agreement for any
        reason, EXACT shall notify each Sublicensee of the termination and
        APOGENT shall have the right, upon the Sublicensee's delivery to APOGENT
        no later than thirty days after the termination date of a written
        request for continuation of the Sublicensee's sublicense. Upon receipt
        of such request and receipt of proof from the Sublicensee, if reasonably
        requested by APOGENT, of the Sublicensee's ability to pay APOGENT
        royalties when due, Apogent will continue the Sublicensee's sublicense
        for the period equal to the shorter of the unexpired term of this
        Agreement or the unexpired term of the Sublicensee's sublicense from
        EXACT on condition that such Sublicensee remains in compliance with the
        terms and conditions of its sublicense agreement, and continues its
        payment obligations directly to APOGENT.

10.4    SURVIVAL. The following Articles shall survive the termination of this
        Agreement for any reason: Articles 1, 2.4, 5-8, 10.3, 10.4, 11 and 12.

                         ARTICLE 11 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION

11.1    DISPUTE RESOLUTION. If a dispute arises between the Parties relating to
        (i) the interpretation or performance of the Agreement; or (ii) the
        grounds for the

                                     Page 9
<Page>

        termination of the Agreement, the Parties agree to convene a Dispute
        Resolution Committee (the "Committee"), consisting of two EXACT
        representatives with decision-making authority and two APOGENT
        representatives with decision-making authority to attempt in good faith
        to negotiate a resolution of the dispute prior to pursuing other
        available remedies. Either Party may request the convening of a
        Committee by written notice to the other Party. A Committee shall
        convene for an initial meeting within forty-five (45) days of such
        written notice. If the Parties have not succeeded in negotiating a
        resolution of the dispute, within thirty (30) days after the initial
        meeting of the Committee, the dispute shall be submitted for binding
        arbitration under the then current Commercial Rules of the American
        Arbitration Association ("AAA").

11.2    Any arbitration under this Article 11 shall be held in Boston,
        Massachusetts. The Parties shall select three (3) arbitrators from a
        list of seven (7) arbitrators provided by the AAA. The Parties shall
        bear the costs of the arbitration equally unless the arbitrators,
        pursuant to their right, but not their obligation, require the
        non-prevailing Party to bear all or any unequal portion of the
        prevailing Party's costs. The arbitrators shall make decisions in
        accordance with applicable Federal and Massachusetts law and the factual
        evidence presented. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and
        may be sued on or enforced by the Party in whose favor it runs in any
        court of competent jurisdiction at the option of the successful Party.
        The arbitrators will be instructed to prepare and deliver a written,
        reasoned opinion conferring their decision. The rights and obligations
        of the Parties to arbitrate any dispute relating to the interpretation
        or performance of this Agreement or the grounds for the termination
        thereof shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement
        for any reason. Nothing in this Agreement prevents either Party from
        seeking equitable relief at any time to prevent irreparable harm or for
        specific enforcement of the terms of this Agreement, except that no
        equitable relief shall be sought to prevent or avoid arbitration under
        the terms of this Agreement.

12.3    INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. The Parties agree that, in the performance of
        this Agreement, they are and shall be independent contractors. Nothing
        herein shall be construed to constitute a partnership or joint venture
        between the Parties nor shall any Party be construed as the agent of any
        other Party for any purpose whatsoever, and no Party shall bind or
        attempt to bind any other Party to any contract or the performance of
        any obligation, or represent to any third party that it has any right to
        enter into any binding obligation on the other Party's behalf.

12.4    SEVERABILITY. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is
        held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or
        enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in
        any way be affected or impaired thereby.

12.5    NON-ASSIGNABILITY. Neither this Agreement nor any part of the Agreement
        is assignable by either Party without the express written consent of the
        other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
        conditioned. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, either Party may
        assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, without
        the consent of the other Party, to an acquirer of all or substantially
        all of such Party's business or assets, whether by merger, sale,
        acquisition or other change of control transaction. This Agreement shall
        be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
        respective successors and assigns.

12.6    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This instrument contains the entire Agreement between
        the Parties. No verbal agreement, conversation or representation between
        any officers, agents, or employees of the Parties either before or after
        the execution of

                                     Page 11
<Page>

        this Agreement may affect or modify any of the terms or obligations
        herein contained.

12.7    MODIFICATIONS IN WRITING. No change, modification, extension, or waiver
        of this Agreement, or any of the provisions herein contained is valid
        unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
        each Party.

12.8    GOVERNING LAW. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the
        legal relations of the Parties to it are governed by the laws of the
        Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to any choice of law
        principal that would dictate the application of the law of another
        jurisdiction. The Parties agree that any legal action arising out of or
        in connection with this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or
        state courts of Massachusetts, and the Parties irrevocably submit for
        all purposes to the jurisdiction of each such court.

12.9    CAPTIONS. The captions are provided for convenience and are not to be
        used in construing this Agreement.

12.10   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
        which shall be deemed an original and all of which when taken together
        shall be deemed but one instrument.

12.11   FORCE MAJEURE. If either Party fails to fulfill its obligations
        hereunder (other than an obligation for the payment of money), when such
        failure is due to an act of God, or other circumstances beyond its
        reasonable control, including but not limited to fire, flood, civil
        commotion, riot, war (declared and undeclared), acts of terrorism,
        revolution, or embargoes, then said failure shall be excused for the
        duration of such event and for such a time thereafter as is reasonable
        to enable the Parties to resume performance under this Agreement.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this agreement to be executed
in quadruplicate by their duly authorized representatives as of the date first
above written.
