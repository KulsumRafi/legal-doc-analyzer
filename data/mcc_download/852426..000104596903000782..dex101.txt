                           LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

     LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT is made as of this 14th day of March, 2003, by
and among FLEET CAPITAL CORPORATION ("Fleet"), a Rhode Island corporation with
an office at One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1400, Chicago, Illinois 60606,
individually as a Lender and as Agent ("Agent") for itself and any other
financial institution which is or becomes a party hereto (each such financial
institution, including Fleet, is referred to hereinafter individually as a
"Lender" and collectively as the "Lenders"), the LENDERS and EXTRUSION
TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Colorado corporation with its chief executive office and
principal place of business at 1710 Broadway, Suite 1710, Denver, Colorado 80290
("ETI") and MID-STATES PLASTICS, INC., a Kentucky corporation with its chief
executive office and principal place of business at 280 Midland Trail, Mt.
Sterling, Kentucky 40353 ("Mid-States"). ETI and Mid-States are sometimes
hereinafter referred to individually as a "Borrower" and collectively as
"Borrowers." Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings assigned
to them in Appendix A, General Definitions. Accounting terms not otherwise
specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

                           SECTION 1. CREDIT FACILITY

     Subject to the terms and conditions of, and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties made in, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, Lenders agree to make a Total Credit Facility of up to Twenty-Five
Million Dollars ($25,000,000) available upon Borrowers' request therefor, as
follows:

     1.1   Loans.

           1.1.1      Revolving Credit Loans. Each Lender agrees, severally and
not jointly, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to make
Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers from time to time during the period from the
date hereof to but not including the last day of the Term, as requested by ETI,
on behalf of each Borrower, in the manner set forth in subsection 3.1.1 hereof,
up to a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding equal to the lesser of
(i) such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment minus the product of such Lender's
Revolving Loan Percentage and the LC Amount minus the product of such Lender's
Revolving Loan Percentage and reserves, if any, minus the outstanding principal
balance of the Term Loan and the Equipment Loans owed to such Lender and (ii)
the product of such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and an amount equal to
the Borrowing Base at such time minus the LC Amount minus reserves, if any.
Agent shall have the right to establish reserves in such amounts, and with
respect to such matters, as Agent shall deem necessary or appropriate in its
sole judgment, against the amount of Revolving Credit Loans which ETI, on behalf
of each Borrower, may otherwise request under this subsection 1.1.1, including,
without limitation, with respect to (i) price adjustments, damages, unearned
discounts, returned products or other matters for which credit memoranda are
issued in the ordinary course of any Borrower's business; (ii) potential
dilution related to Accounts; (iii) shrinkage, spoilage and obsolescence of any
Borrower's Inventory; (iv) slow moving Inventory; (v) other sums chargeable
against Borrowers' Loan Account as Revolving Credit Loans under any section of
this Agreement; (vi) amounts owing by any Borrower to any Person to the extent
secured by a Lien on, or trust over, any Property of any Borrower; (vii) amounts
owing by any Borrower in connection with Product Obligations; and

<PAGE>

(viii) such other specific events, conditions or contingencies as to which
Agent, in its sole judgment, determines reserves should be established from time
to time hereunder. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be repayable in accordance
with the terms of the Revolving Notes and shall be secured by all of the
Collateral.

           1.1.2      Overadvances. Insofar as ETI, on behalf of each Borrower,
may request and Agent or Majority Lenders (as provided below) may be willing in
their sole and absolute discretion to make Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers
at a time when the unpaid balance of Revolving Credit Loans plus the sum of the
LC Amount plus the amount of LC Obligations that have not been reimbursed by
Borrowers or funded with a Revolving Credit Loan, plus reserves, exceeds, or
would exceed with the making of any such Revolving Credit Loan, the Borrowing
Base (and such Loan or Loans being herein referred to individually as an
"Overadvance" and collectively, as "Overadvances"), Agent shall enter such
Overadvances as debits in the Loan Account. All Overadvances shall be repaid on
demand, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall bear interest as provided
in this Agreement for Revolving Credit Loans generally. Any Overadvance made
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be made by all Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Revolving Loan Percentages. Overadvances in the aggregate
amount of $250,000 or less may, unless a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, be made in the sole and absolute discretion of
Agent. Overadvances in an aggregate amount of more than $250,000 but less than
$500,000 may, unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, be made in the sole and absolute discretion of the Majority Lenders.
Overadvances in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or more and Overadvances to be
made after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event
of Default shall require the consent of all Lenders. The foregoing
notwithstanding, in no event, unless otherwise consented to by all Lenders, (w)
shall any Overadvances be outstanding for more than sixty (60) consecutive days,
(x) after all outstanding Overadvances have been repaid, shall Agent or Lenders
make any additional Overadvances unless sixty (60) days or more have expired
since the last date on which any Overadvances were outstanding, (y) shall
Overadvances be outstanding on more than ninety (90) days within any one hundred
eighty day (180) period or (z) shall Agent make Revolving Credit Loans on behalf
of Lenders under this subsection 1.1.2 to the extent such Revolving Credit Loans
would cause a Lender's share of the Revolving Credit Loans to exceed such
Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment minus such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage
of the LC Amount.

           1.1.3      Use of Proceeds. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be used
solely for (i) satisfaction of Indebtedness of Borrowers owed under Borrowers'
existing senior credit facility, (ii) payment of a portion of the purchase price
due under the Acquisition Agreement, (iii) Borrowers' general operating capital
needs in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and all
applicable laws, and (iv) other purposes permitted under this Agreement.

           1.1.4      Intentionally Omitted.

           1.1.5      Agent Loans. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Agent, in its sole discretion, may make
Revolving Credit Loans on behalf of Lenders, in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $1,000,000, if Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems that
such Revolving Credit Loans are necessary or desirable (i) to protect all or any
portion of the Collateral, (ii) to enhance the likelihood, or maximize the
amount of,

                                        2

<PAGE>

repayment of the Loans and the other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other
amount chargeable to Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, including without
limitation costs, fees and expenses as described in Sections 2.8 and 2.9
(hereinafter, "Agent Loans"); provided, that in no event shall (a) the maximum
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans exceed the aggregate Revolving
Loan Commitments and (b) Majority Lenders may at any time revoke Agent's
authorization to make Agent Loans. Any such revocation must be in writing and
shall become effective prospectively upon Agent's receipt thereof. Each Lender
shall be obligated to advance its Revolving Loan Percentage of each Agent Loan.
If Agent Loans are made pursuant to the preceding sentence, then (a) the
Borrowing Base shall be deemed increased by the amount of such permitted Agent
Loans, but only for so long as Agent allows such Agent Loans to be outstanding,
and (b) all Lenders that have committed to make Revolving Credit Loans shall be
bound to make, or permit to remain outstanding, such Agent Loans based upon
their Revolving Loan Percentages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     1.2   Letters of Credit; LC Guaranties. Agent agrees, for so long as no
Default or Event of Default exists and if requested by ETI, on behalf of each or
any Borrower, to (i) issue its, or cause to be issued by Bank or another
Affiliate of Agent, on the date requested by ETI, on behalf of each or any
Borrower, Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower or (ii) execute LC
Guaranties by which Agent, Bank, or another Affiliate of Agent, on the date
requested by ETI, on behalf of each or any Borrower, shall guaranty the payment
or performance by Borrowers of their reimbursement obligations with respect to
letters of credit; provided that the LC Amount shall not exceed $1,000,000 at
any time. No Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty may have an expiration date after
the last day of the Term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Borrowers, Agent and Lenders hereby agree that all LC Obligations and
all obligations of Borrowers relating thereto shall be satisfied by the prompt
issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Portions,
which Borrowers hereby acknowledge are requested and Lenders hereby agree to
fund. In the event that Revolving Credit Loans are not, for any reason, promptly
made to satisfy all then existing LC Obligations, each Lender hereby agrees to
pay to Agent, on demand, an amount equal to such LC Obligations multiplied by
such Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage, and until so paid, such amount shall be
secured by the Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the same
rate and in the same manner as Base Rate Portions. Immediately upon the issuance
of a Letter of Credit or an LC Guaranty under this Agreement, each Lender shall
be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from
Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation
therein equal to such LC Obligations multiplied by such Lender's Revolving Loan
Percentage.

     1.3   Term Loan and Equipment Loans.

           1.3.1      Term Loan. Each Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees
to make a term loan (collectively, the "Term Loan") to Borrowers on the Closing
Date, in the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's Term Loan Commitment,
which shall be repayable in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan Notes and
shall be secured by all of the Collateral. The proceeds of the Term Loan shall
be used solely for the purposes for which the proceeds of the Revolving Credit
Loans are authorized to be used. The aggregate amount of all Term Loan
Commitments is $5,000,000.

                                        3

<PAGE>

           1.3.2      Equipment Loans. Each Lender agrees, severally and not
jointly, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to make Equipment
Loans from time to time to Borrowers as requested by ETI, on behalf of each
Borrower, in the manner set forth in subsection 3.1.1 hereof, up to a maximum
principal amount equal to the product of such Lender's Equipment Loan Percentage
multiplied by $1,500,000. The Equipment Loans shall be repayable in accordance
with the terms of the Equipment Loan Notes and shall be secured by all of the
Collateral. No repayment in respect of any Equipment Loan may be reborrowed.
Each Lender will make Equipment Loans only if each of the following conditions
is satisfied:

     (a)   Borrowers shall have provided evidence to Agent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, that Borrowers will use the proceeds
of each requested Equipment Loan to purchase new production Equipment (i) used
in Borrowers' business operations, (ii) to be located at a location in
compliance with this Agreement, and (iii) subject to no Liens other than those
in favor of Agent;

     (b)   Agent shall have received the invoice from the seller of the
Equipment evidencing the cost of the Equipment Borrowers propose to purchase
with the proceeds of each Equipment Loan, and such invoice discloses that the
original principal amount of such requested Equipment Loan, when aggregated with
all other Equipment Loans (if any) with respect to such Equipment, does not
exceed eighty percent (80%) of the cost thereof, exclusive of transportation,
installation, taxes, perishable tooling and other soft costs (as determined by
Agent in its reasonable credit judgment) pertaining thereto;

     (c)   Agent shall have received, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent, evidence of insurance covering the Equipment Borrowers
propose to purchase with the proceeds of each Equipment Loan;

     (d)   the requested Equipment Loan is in a minimum original principal
amount of $500,000;

     (e)   the requested Equipment Loan would be the only Equipment Loan funded
by Lenders during Borrowers' then existing fiscal quarter;

     (f)   Borrowers shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to Agent and
each Lender any and all documents, agreements and instruments deemed reasonably
necessary by Agent or any Lender in connection with the making of such Equipment
Loan; and

     (g)   after giving effect to any such Equipment Loan, no Overadvance would
exist and be continuing.

The proceeds of the Equipment Loans shall be used solely for the purposes
specified in this subsection 1.3.2.

                      SECTION 2. INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES

     2.1   Interest.

           2.1.1      Rates of Interest. Interest shall accrue on the principal
amount of the Base Rate Revolving Portions, the Base Rate Term Portions and Base
Rate Equipment Portions outstanding at the end of each day at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect plus the Base Rate. Said
rate of interest shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase
or decrease in the Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business on the day
that any such change in the Base Rate occurs. If Borrowers exercise their LIBOR
Option as provided in Section 3.1, interest shall accrue on the principal amount
of the LIBOR Revolving Portions, the LIBOR Term Portions and the LIBOR Equipment
Portions outstanding at the end of each day at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin then in effect plus the LIBOR applicable to each LIBOR Portion
for the corresponding Interest Period.

           2.1.2      Default Rate of Interest. At the option of Agent or the
Majority Lenders, upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and
during the continuation thereof, the principal amount of all Loans shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.0% plus the interest rate otherwise
applicable thereto (the "Default Rate").

           2.1.3      Maximum Interest. In no event whatsoever shall the
aggregate of all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under the Notes and
charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to the
Notes exceed the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of
competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto.
If any provisions of this Agreement or the Notes are in contravention of any
such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to conform thereto (the
"Maximum Rate"). If at any time, the amount of interest paid hereunder is
limited by the Maximum Rate, and the amount at which interest accrues hereunder
is subsequently below the Maximum Rate, the rate at which interest accrues
hereunder shall remain at the Maximum Rate, until such time as the aggregate
interest paid hereunder equals the amount of interest that would have been paid

accordance with Agent's current schedule of fees in effect from time to time in
connection with audits of the books and records and Properties of Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries and such other matters as Agent shall deem appropriate in its
sole judgment, plus all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Agent in
connection with such audits, whether such audits are conducted by employees of
Agent or by third parties hired by Agent. Such audit fees and out-of-pocket

whether or not an Event of Default then exists, (i) Agent incurs legal or
accounting expenses or any other costs or out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with (1) the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, any amendment of or modification of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, or any syndication or attempted syndication of the
Obligations (including, without limitation, printing and distribution of

relating to the Collateral, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or
any Borrower's, any of their Subsidiaries' or any Guarantor's affairs; (2) any
attempt to enforce any rights of Agent or any Lender against any Borrower or any
other Person which may be obligated to Agent or any Lender by virtue of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the

restore, collect, sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the

pocket expenses of Agent or any Lender, as applicable, shall be charged to
Borrowers; provided, that Borrowers shall not be responsible for such costs and
out-of-pocket expenses to the extent incurred because of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Agent or any Lender. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers
under this Section 2.8 shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral,
shall be payable on demand to Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and
shall bear interest from the date such demand is made until paid in full at the
rate applicable to Base Rate Revolving Portions from time to time. Borrowers
shall also reimburse Agent for expenses incurred by Agent in its administration
of the Collateral to the extent and in the manner provided in Sections 2.9 and
2.10 hereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, Borrowers shall not be required to
reimburse Agent or any Lender for any costs or expenses incurred in any action
where there is entered a final non-appealable court order pursuant to which
Agent or Lenders are not the prevailing party (as determined by said order).

     2.9   Bank Charges. Borrowers shall pay to Agent, on demand, any and
all fees, costs or expenses which Agent or any Lender pays to a bank or other
similar institution arising out of or in connection with (i) the forwarding to

<PAGE>

Agreement and (ii) the depositing for collection by Agent or any Lender of any
check or item of payment received or delivered to Agent or any Lender on account
of the Obligations.

     2.10  Collateral Protection Expenses; Appraisals. All out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in protecting, storing, warehousing, insuring, handling,
maintaining and shipping the Collateral, and any and all excise, property,
sales, and use taxes imposed by any state, federal, or local authority on any of
the Collateral or in respect of the sale thereof shall be borne and paid by
Borrowers. If Borrowers fail to promptly pay any portion thereof when due, Agent
may, at its option, but shall not be required to, pay the same and charge
Borrowers therefor. Additionally, from time to time, Agent may, at Borrowers'
expense, obtain appraisals from appraisers (who may be personnel of Agent),
stating the then current fair market value of all or any portion of the real
estate or personal property of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, including
without limitation the Inventory of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries; provided
that unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Agent shall not
be permitted to obtain at Borrowers' expense more than one such appraisal, with
respect to each type or category of Borrowers' assets, per calendar year.

     2.11  Payment of Charges. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under
this Agreement shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral, shall be,
unless specifically otherwise provided, payable on demand and shall bear
interest from the date demand was made or such amount is due, as applicable,

time to time.

     2.12  No Deductions. Any and all payments or reimbursements made
hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto; excluding, however, the following: taxes imposed on the
income of Agent or any Lender or franchise taxes by the jurisdiction under the
laws of which Agent or any Lender is organized or doing business or any
political subdivision thereof and taxes imposed on its income by the
jurisdiction of Agent's or such Lender's applicable lending office or any
political subdivision thereof or franchise taxes (all such taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect
thereto excluding such taxes imposed on net income and franchise taxes, herein
"Tax Liabilities"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any such
Tax Liabilities from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to Agent or any
Lender, then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so
that, after all required deductions are made, Agent or such Lender receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.

     Credit Loan shall be made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following
     manner: (a) ETI, on

                                        8

<PAGE>

     behalf of each Borrower, may give Agent notice of Borrowers' intention to
     borrow, in which notice ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall specify the
     amount of the proposed borrowing of a Revolving Credit Loan and the
     proposed borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day, no later than 11:00
     a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on the proposed borrowing date (or in
     accordance with subsection 3.1.7, 3.1.8 or 3.1.9, as applicable, in the
     case of a request for a LIBOR Revolving Portion), provided, however, that
     no such request may be made at a time when there exists a Default or an
     Event of Default; and (b) the becoming due of any amount required to be
     paid under this Agreement, or the Notes, whether as interest or for any
     other Obligation, shall be deemed irrevocably to be a request for a
     Revolving Credit Loan on the due date in the amount required to pay such
     interest or other Obligation.

                     (ii)    Equipment Loans. A request for an Equipment Loan
     shall be made in the following manner: ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, may
     give Agent notice of the intention to borrow an Equipment Loan, in which
     ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall specify the amount of the proposed
     borrowing (consistent with subsection 1.3.2) and the proposed borrowing
     date, which shall be a Business Day, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago,
     Illinois time) on the date 2 Business Days prior to such proposed borrowing
     date (or in accordance with subsection 3.1.7, 3.1.8 or 3.1.9, as
     applicable, in the case of a request for a LIBOR Equipment Portion);
     provided, however, that no such request may be made at a time when there
     exists a Default or an Event of Default. In addition, Borrowers shall also
     comply with the requirements of subsection 1.3.2 with respect to such
     Equipment Loan.

           3.1.2      Disbursement. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize
Agent to disburse the proceeds of each Loan requested, or deemed to be
requested, pursuant to subsection 3.1.1(a) as follows: (i) the proceeds of each
Revolving Credit Loan requested under subsection 3.1.1(a) shall be disbursed by
Agent in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available
funds, in the case of the initial borrowing, in accordance with the terms of the
written disbursement letter from Borrowers, and in the case of each subsequent
borrowing, by wire transfer to such bank account as may be agreed upon by
Borrowers and Agent from time to time or elsewhere if pursuant to a written
direction from Borrowers; (ii) the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan deemed
requested under subsection 3.1.1(b) shall be disbursed by Agent by way of direct
payment of the relevant interest or other Obligation; and (iii) the proceeds of
each Equipment Loan requested under subsection 3.1.1(ii) shall be disbursed by
Agent in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available
funds, as directed by ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, in writing with respect
to such Equipment Loan. If at any time any Loan is funded by Agent or Lenders in
excess of the amount requested or deemed requested by Borrowers, Borrowers agree
to repay the excess to Agent immediately upon the earlier to occur of (a) any
Borrower's discovery of the error and (b) notice thereof to Borrowers from Agent
or any Lender.

           3.1.3      Payment by Lenders. Agent shall give to each Lender prompt
written notice by facsimile, telex or cable of the receipt by Agent from ETI of
any request for a Revolving Credit Loan or Equipment Loan. Each such notice
shall specify the requested date and amount of such Revolving Credit Loan or
Equipment Loan, whether such Revolving Credit Loan or Equipment Loan shall be
subject to the LIBOR Option, and the amount of each Lender's

                                        9

<PAGE>

advance thereunder (in accordance with its applicable Revolving Loan Percentage
or Equipment Loan Percentage). Each Lender shall, not later than 12:00 p.m.
(Chicago time) on such requested date, wire to a bank designated by Agent the
amount of that Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage of the requested Revolving
Credit Loan or Equipment Loan Percentage of the requested Equipment Loan, as
applicable. The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Loans to be
made by it shall not release any other Lender of its obligations hereunder to
make its Revolving Credit Loan. Neither Agent nor any other Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit
Loan to be made by such other Lender. The foregoing notwithstanding, Agent, in
its sole discretion, may from its own funds make a Revolving Credit Loan on
behalf of any Lender. In such event, the Lender on behalf of whom Agent made the
Revolving Credit Loan shall reimburse Agent for the amount of such Revolving
Credit Loan made on its behalf, on a weekly (or more frequent, as determined by
Agent in its sole discretion) basis. On each such settlement date, Agent will
pay to each Lender the net amount owing to such Lender in connection with such
settlement, including without limitation amounts relating to Loans, fees,
interest and other amounts payable hereunder. The entire amount of interest
attributable to such Revolving Credit Loan for the period from the date on which
such Revolving Credit Loan was made by Agent on such Lender's behalf until Agent
is reimbursed by such Lender, shall be paid to Agent for its own account.

           3.1.4      Authorization. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize
Agent, in Agent's sole discretion, to advance to Borrowers, and to charge to
Borrowers' Loan Account hereunder as a Revolving Credit Loan (which shall be a
Base Rate Revolving Portion), a sum sufficient to pay all interest accrued on
the Obligations during the immediately preceding month and to pay all fees,
costs and expenses and other Obligations at any time owed by any Borrower to
Agent or any Lender hereunder.

           3.1.5      Letter of Credit and LC Guaranty Requests. A request for
a Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty shall be made in the following manner: ETI, on
behalf of each Borrower, may give Agent and Bank a written notice of its request
for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty, not later than 11:00 a.m.
(Chicago, Illinois time), one Business Day before the proposed issuance date
thereof, in which notice ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall specify the
proposed issuer, issuance date and format and wording for the Letter of Credit
or LC Guaranty being requested (which shall be satisfactory to Agent and the
Person being asked to issue such Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty); provided,
that no such request may be made at a time when there exists a Default or Event
of Default. Such request shall be accompanied by an executed application and
reimbursement agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Agent and the
Person being asked to issue the Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty, as well as any
required resolutions.

           3.1.6      Method of Making Requests. As an accommodation to
Borrowers, unless a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence, (i)
Agent shall permit telephonic or electronic requests for Revolving Credit Loans
or Equipment Loans to Agent; provided that in the case of requested for
Equipment Loans, Borrowers have previously delivered to Agent the written
materials required pursuant to subsection 1.3.2, (ii) Agent and Bank may, in
their discretion, permit electronic transmittal of requests for Letters of
Credit and LC Guaranties to them, and (iii) Agent may, in Agent's discretion,
permit electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements or
reports to Agent. Unless Borrowers specifically direct Agent or

                                       10

<PAGE>

Bank in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or electronic
communications from any Borrower, neither Agent nor Bank shall have any
liability to Borrowers for any loss or damage suffered by any Borrower as a
result of Agent's or Bank's honoring of any requests, execution of any
instructions, authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports
communicated to it telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been
sent to Agent or Bank by a Borrower, and neither Agent nor Bank shall have any
duty to verify the origin of any such communication or the authority of the
Person sending it. Each telephonic request for a Revolving Credit Loan,
Equipment Loan, Letter of Credit or LC Guaranty accepted by Agent and Bank, if
applicable, hereunder shall be promptly followed by a written confirmation of
such request from ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, to Agent and Bank, if
applicable.

           3.1.7      LIBOR Portions. Provided that as of both the date of the
LIBOR Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of
Default exists, in the event Borrowers desire to obtain a LIBOR Portion, ETI, on
behalf of each Borrower, shall give Agent a LIBOR Request no later than 11:00
a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on the third Business Day prior to the requested
borrowing date. Each LIBOR Request shall be irrevocable and binding on
Borrowers. In no event shall Borrowers be permitted to have outstanding at any
one time LIBOR Portions with more than three (3) different Interest Periods.

           3.1.8      Conversion of Base Rate Portions. Provided that as of both
the date of the LIBOR Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no
Default or Event of Default exists, ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, may, on any
Business Day, convert any Base Rate Portion into a LIBOR Portion. If Borrowers
desire to convert a Base Rate Portion, ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall
give Agent a LIBOR Request no later then 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on
the third Business Day prior to the requested conversion date. After giving
effect to any conversion of Base Rate Portions to LIBOR Portions, Borrowers
shall not be permitted to have outstanding at any one time LIBOR Portions with
more than three (3) different Interest Periods.

           3.1.9 Continuation of LIBOR Portions. Provided that as of both the
date of the LIBOR Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default
or Event of Default exists, ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, may, on any
Business Day, continue any LIBOR Portions into a subsequent Interest Period of
the same or a different permitted duration. If Borrowers desire to continue a
LIBOR Portion, ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall give Agent a LIBOR Request
no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on the third Business Day
prior to the requested continuation date. After giving effect to any
continuation of LIBOR Portions, Borrowers shall not be permitted to have
outstanding at any one time LIBOR Portions with more than three (3) different
Interest Periods. If ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall fail to give timely
notice of its election to continue any LIBOR Portion or portion thereof as
provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted, such LIBOR
Portion or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Portion shall be repaid, shall
automatically be converted into a Base Rate Portion at the end of the Interest
Period then in effect with respect to such LIBOR Portion.

           3.1.10     Inability to Make LIBOR Portions. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive,
or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall
make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this subsection 3.1.10, the
term "Lender" shall include the office or branch where such Lender or any
corporation or bank then controlling such Lender makes or maintains any LIBOR
Portions) to

                                       11

<PAGE>

make or maintain its LIBOR Portions, or if with respect to any
Interest Period, Agent is unable to determine the LIBOR relating thereto, or
adverse or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law relating to, the
London interbank market make it, in the reasonable judgment of Agent,
impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Portions, or make the projected
LIBOR unreflective of the actual costs of funds therefor to any Lender, the
obligation of Agent and Lenders to make or continue LIBOR Portions or convert
Base Rate Portions to LIBOR Portions hereunder shall forthwith be suspended
during the pendency of such circumstances and Borrower shall, if any affected
LIBOR Portions are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent, convert
such affected LIBOR Portions into Base Rate Portions.

     3.2   Payments. Except where evidenced by notes or other instruments issued
or made by any Borrower to any Lender and accepted by such Lender specifically
containing payment instructions that are in conflict with this Section 3.2 (in
which case the conflicting provisions of said notes or other instruments shall
govern and control), the Obligations shall be payable as follows:

           3.2.1      Principal.

                      (i)    Revolving  Credit  Loans.  Principal  on account of
     Revolving Credit Loans shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent for the
     ratable benefit of Lenders immediately upon the earliest of (i) the receipt
     by Agent or any Borrower of any proceeds of any of the Collateral (except
     as otherwise provided herein), including without limitation pursuant to
     subsections 3.3.1 and 6.2.4, to the extent of said proceeds, subject to
     Borrowers' rights to reborrow such amounts in compliance with subsection
     1.1.1 hereof; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of
     which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to accelerate the maturity and
     payment of the Obligations, or (iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant
     to Section 4 hereof; provided, however, that, if an Overadvance shall exist
     at any time, Borrowers shall, on demand, repay the Overadvance. Each
     payment (including principal prepayment) by Borrowers on account of
     principal of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied first to Base Rate
     Revolving Portions and then to LIBOR Revolving Portions.

                      (ii)   Term Loan. Principal payable on account of the Term
     Loan shall be payable by Borrowers in accordance with the terms of the Term
     Notes.

                      (iii)  Equipment Loans. Principal payable on account of
     the Equipment Loans shall be payable by Borrowers in accordance with the
     terms of the Equipment Loans.

           3.2.2      Interest.

                      (i)    Base Rate Portion. Interest accrued on the Base
     Rate Portion shall be due and payable on the earliest of (1) the first
     calendar day of each month (for the immediately preceding month), computed
     through the last calendar day of the preceding month, (2) the occurrence of
     an Event of Default in consequence of which Agent or Majority Lenders elect
     to accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations or (3)
     termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

                                       12

<PAGE>

                      (ii)   LIBOR Portion. Interest accrued on each LIBOR
     Portion shall be due and payable on each LIBOR Interest Payment Date and on
     the earlier of (1) the occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of
     which Agent or Majority Lenders elect to accelerate the maturity and
     payment of the Obligations or (2) termination of this Agreement pursuant to
     Section 4 hereof.

           3.2.3      Costs, Fees and Charges. Costs, fees and charges payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent, as and when
provided in Section 2 or Section 3 hereof, as applicable to Agent or a Lender,
as applicable, or to any other Person designated by Agent or such Lender in
writing.

           3.2.4      Other Obligations. The balance of the Obligations
requiring the payment of money, if any, shall be payable by Borrowers to Agent
for distribution to Lenders, as appropriate, as and when provided in this
Agreement, the Other Agreements or the Security Documents, or on demand,
whichever is later.

           3.2.5      Prepayment of/Failure to Borrow LIBOR Portions. Borrowers
may prepay a LIBOR Portion only upon at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice to Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable). Borrowers shall pay
to each Lender, upon request of such Lender, such amount or amounts as shall be
sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate such Lender
for any loss, cost, or expense incurred as a result of: (i) any payment of a
LIBOR Portion on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
LIBOR Portion; (ii) any failure by Borrowers to borrow a LIBOR Portion on the
date specified by Borrowers' LIBOR Request; or (iii) any failure by Borrowers to
pay a LIBOR Portion on the date for payment specified in Borrowers' written
notice. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrowers shall pay to each Lender a
"yield maintenance fee" in an amount computed as follows: the current rate for
United States Treasury securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be
converted to a bond equivalent) with a maturity date closest to the Interest
Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Portion as to which the prepayment is made,
shall be subtracted from the LIBOR in effect at the time of prepayment. If the
result is zero or a negative number, there shall be no yield maintenance fee. If
the result is a positive number, then the resulting percentage shall be
multiplied by the amount of the principal balance being prepaid. The resulting
amount shall be divided by 360 and multiplied by the number of days remaining in
the Interest Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Portion as to which the
prepayment is made. Said amount shall be reduced to present value calculated by
using the above referenced United States Treasury securities rate and the number
of days remaining in the term chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Portion as to which
prepayment is made. The resulting amount shall be the yield maintenance fee due
to the applicable Lender upon the prepayment of a LIBOR Portion. If by reason of
an Event of Default, Agent or Majority Lenders elect to declare the Obligations
to be immediately due and payable, then any yield maintenance fee with respect
to a LIBOR Portion shall become due and payable in the same manner as though
Borrowers had exercised such right of prepayment.

     3.3   Mandatory and Optional Prepayments.

           3.3.1      Proceeds of Sale, Loss, Destruction or Condemnation of
Collateral. Except as provided in subsections 6.4.2 and 8.2.9, if any Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries sells

                                       13

<PAGE>

any of the Collateral or if any of the Collateral is lost or destroyed or taken
by condemnation, Borrowers shall, unless otherwise agreed by Majority Lenders,
pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders as and when received by such
Borrower or such Subsidiary and as a mandatory prepayment of the Loans, as
herein provided, a sum equal to the proceeds (including insurance payments but
net of costs and taxes incurred in connection with such sale or event) received
by such Borrower or such Subsidiary from such sale, loss, destruction or
condemnation. To the extent that the Collateral sold, lost, destroyed or
condemned consists of Equipment (other than Equipment that was financed with the
proceeds of Equipment Loans), real Property, or other Property other than
Accounts or Inventory, the applicable prepayment shall be applied first to the
installments of principal due under the Term Notes ratably, to be applied to
future installment payments in inverse order of maturity until paid in full,
second to the installments of principal due under the Equipment Loan Notes
ratably, to be applied to future installment payments in inverse order of
maturity until paid in full, and third to repay outstanding principal of
Revolving Credit Loans, on a pro rata basis. To the extent that Collateral sold,
lost, destroyed or condemned consists of Equipment that was financed with the
proceeds of Equipment Loans, the applicable prepayment shall be applied first to
the installments of principal due under the applicable Equipment Loan Notes,
ratably, to be applied to future installment payments in inverse order of
maturity until paid in full, second to installments of principal due under the
other Equipment Loan Notes, ratably, to be applied to future installment
payments in inverse order of maturity, third to installments of principal due
under the Term Notes, ratably, to be applied to future installment payments in
inverse order of maturity, and fourth to repay outstanding principal of
Revolving Credit Loans, on a pro rata basis. To the extent that the Collateral
sold, lost, destroyed or condemned consists of Accounts or Inventory, the
applicable prepayment shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal
balance of the Revolving Credit Loans, but shall not permanently reduce the
Revolving Loan Commitments.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing:

                  (x)   if the proceeds of insurance (net of costs and taxes
incurred) with respect to any loss or destruction of Equipment, Inventory or
real Property (i) are less than $500,000, unless an Event of Default is then in
existence, such amounts shall be provisionally applied to reduce the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans and provided no Default or Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrowers shall be permitted
within 180 days (or such longer period as reasonably consented to by Agent)
after the receipt by the applicable Borrower of such proceeds to reborrow such
proceeds in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for use in replacing or
repairing the damaged or lost Collateral. If such damaged or lost Collateral is
not replaced or repaired within such 180-day (or such longer period as
reasonably consented to by Agent) period, all such proceeds shall be applied to
installments of principal due under the Term Notes in the manner specified in
the second sentence of this Section 3.3.1 until payment thereof in full; and

                  (y)   if (i) the net sales proceeds received by any Borrower
in connection with any sale of Equipment (other than Equipment purchased, in
part, with the proceeds of Equipment Loans) or real Property exceed 125% of the
most recent appraised value of such Equipment or real Property (as determined by
Agent in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (ii) no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, and (iii) at the time of such sale, if average
Availability for the sixty (60) days immediately prior to such sale equals or
exceeds $6,000,000,

                                       14

<PAGE>

then the excess of such net sale proceeds over 125% of such appraised value of
the sold Equipment or real Property shall be applied to reduce the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans.

           3.3.2      Excess Cash Flow Recapture. Borrowers shall prepay the
Loans in amounts equal to Borrowers' Excess Cash Flow with respect to each
fiscal year of ETI during the Term hereof, commencing with the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2003, such prepayments to be based upon, and made within 5
Business Days following the due date for delivery by Borrowers to Agent of the
annual financial statements required by subsection 8.1.3(i) hereof and each such
prepayment shall be applied to the Loans in the manner specified in the second
sentence of subsection 3.3.1 until payment thereof in full; provided, however,
that the maximum amount of prepayments required pursuant to this subsection
3.3.2 shall be equal to $1,000,000.

           3.3.3      Proceeds from Issuance of Additional Indebtedness or
Equity. If any Borrower issues any additional Indebtedness or obtains any
additional equity in a manner permitted under this Agreement, Borrowers shall
pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders, when and as received by such
Borrower and as a mandatory prepayment of the Obligations, a sum equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the net proceeds to the applicable Borrower of the
issuance of such Indebtedness or equity. Any such prepayment shall be applied to
the Loans in the manner specified in the second sentence of subsection 3.3.1
until payment thereof in full.

           3.3.4      LIBOR Portions. If the application of any payment made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 at a time when no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing would result in termination of a LIBOR
Portion prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Portion, the
amount of such prepayment shall not be applied to such LIBOR Portion, but will,
at Borrowers' option, be held by Agent in a non-interest bearing account at a
Lender or another bank satisfactory to Agent in its discretion, which account is
in the name of Agent and from which account only Agent can make any withdrawal,
in each case to be applied as such amount would otherwise have been applied
under this Section 3.3 at the earlier to occur of (i) the last day of the
relevant Interest Period or (ii) the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default.

           3.3.5      Optional Prepayments. Borrowers may, at their option from
time to time upon not less than 3 days prior written notice to Agent, prepay
installments of the Term Notes or the Equipment Loan Notes, provided that the
amount of any such prepayment is at least $500,000 and in integral multiples of
$100,000 above $500,000, and that such prepayments are made ratably with respect
to all Term Notes or all Equipment Loan Notes, as applicable. Each such
prepayment shall be applied to the installments of principal due under the Term
Notes or Equipment Loan Notes, as applicable, in the inverse order of maturity.
Optional prepayments made on or prior to December 31, 2004, shall be applied to
Loans in the manner specified in the second sentence of subsection 3.3.1 until
payment thereof in full. Any such optional prepayment made after December 31,
2004 shall be credited against the amount of the mandatory prepayment required
under subsection 3.3.2 for the fiscal year in which such optional prepayment was
made. Except for charges under subsection 3.2.5 applicable to prepayments of
LIBOR Term Portions or LIBOR Equipment Portions, and except for charges under
Section 2.6, such prepayments shall be without premium or penalty.

                                       15

     3.4   Application of Payments and Collections.

           3.4.1      Collections. All items of payment received by Agent by
12:00 noon, Chicago, Illinois, time, on any Business Day shall be deemed
received on that Business Day. All items of payment received after 12:00 noon,
Chicago, Illinois, time, on any Business Day shall be deemed received on the
following Business Day. If as the result of collections of Accounts as
authorized by subsection 6.2.4 hereof or otherwise, a credit balance exists in
the Loan Account, such credit balance shall not accrue interest in favor of
Borrowers, but shall be disbursed to Borrowers or otherwise at ETI's, on behalf
of each Borrower, direction in the manner set forth in subsection 3.1.2, upon
ETI's, on behalf of each Borrower, request at any time, so long as no Default or
Event of Default then exists. Agent may at its option, offset such credit
balance against any of the Obligations upon and during the continuance of an
Event of Default.

           3.4.2      Apportionment, Application and Reversal of Payments.
Principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among Lenders
(according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments
relate held by each Lender). All payments shall be remitted to Agent and all
such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not
constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts, or, except
as provided in subsection 3.3.1, other Collateral received by Agent, shall be
applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, first, to pay any
fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements (other than amounts related to
Product Obligations) then due to Agent or Lenders from Borrowers; second, to pay
interest due from Borrowers in respect of all Loans, including and Agent Loans;
third, to pay or prepay principal of Agent Loans; fourth, to pay or prepay
principal of the Revolving Credit Loans (other than Agent Loans) and unpaid
reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit; fifth, to pay an
amount to Agent equal to all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations to be held
as cash Collateral for such Obligations; sixth, to pay or prepay principal of
the Term Loan; seventh, to pay or prepay principal of the Equipment Loans;
eighth, to the payment of any other Obligation (other than amounts related to
Product Obligations) due to Agent or any Lender by Borrowers; and ninth, to pay
any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements related to Product Obligations.
After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent
shall have the continuing exclusive right to apply and reapply any and all such
payments and collections received at any time or times hereafter by Agent or its
agent against the Obligations, in such manner as Agent may deem advisable,
notwithstanding any entry by Agent or any Lender upon any of its books and
records.

     3.5   All Loans to Constitute One Obligation. The Loans and LC Guarantees
shall constitute one general Obligation of Borrowers, and shall be secured by
Agent's Lien upon all of the Collateral.

     3.6   Loan Account. Agent shall enter all Loans as debits to a loan account
(the "Loan Account") and shall also record in the Loan Account all payments made
by Borrowers on any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral which are finally
paid to Agent, and may record therein, in accordance with customary accounting
practice, other debits and credits, including interest and all charges and
expenses properly chargeable to Borrowers.

     3.7   Statements of Account. Agent will account to Borrowers monthly with a
statement of Loans, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement during
the

                                       16

<PAGE>

immediately preceding month, and such account rendered by Agent shall be
deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers absent demonstrable error
unless Agent is notified by ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, in writing to the
contrary within 30 days of the date each accounting is received by Borrowers.
Such notice shall only be deemed an objection to those items specifically
objected to therein.

     3.8   Increased Costs. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) adopted or implemented after the date of this Agreement and having
general applicability to all banks or finance companies within the jurisdiction
in which any Lender operates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the effect
of and phasing in of capital requirements or other regulations or guidelines
passed prior to the date of this Agreement), or any interpretation or
application thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance of such Lender
therewith, shall:

                 (i)    (1)  subject such Lender to any tax with respect to this
     Agreement (other than (a) any tax based on or measured by net income or
     otherwise in the nature of a net income tax, including, without limitation,
     any franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital, net worth or
     comparable basis for measurement and (b) any tax collected by a withholding
     on payments and which neither is computed by reference to the net income of
     the payee nor is in the nature of an advance collection of a tax based on
     or measured by the net income of the payee) or (2) change the basis of
     taxation of payments to such Lender of principal, fees, interest or any
     other amount payable hereunder or under any Loan Documents (other than in
     respect of (a) any tax based on or measured by net income or otherwise in
     the nature of a net income tax, including, without limitation, any
     franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital, net worth or comparable
     basis for measurement and (b) any tax collected by a withholding on
     payments and which neither is computed by reference to the net income of
     the payee nor is in the nature of an advance collection of a tax based on
     or measured by the net income of the payee);

                 (ii)   impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except
     any reserve taken into account in the determination of the applicable
     LIBOR), special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets
     held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or
     other credit extended by, any office of such Lender, including (without
     limitation) pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the
     Federal Reserve System; or

                 (iii)  impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any
     other condition with respect to any Loan Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, renewing or maintaining Loans hereunder or the result of any of the
foregoing is to reduce the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder, or the result of any of the foregoing
is to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans, then, in any such case, Borrowers
shall pay such Lender, upon demand and certification not later than sixty (60)
days following its receipt of notice of the imposition of such increased costs,
such additional amount as will compensate such

                                       17

<PAGE>

Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, to the
extent such Lender has not otherwise been compensated, with respect to a
particular Loan, for such increased cost as a result of an increase in the Base
Rate or the LIBOR. An officer of the applicable Lender shall determine the
amount of such additional cost or reduced amount using reasonable averaging and
attribution methods and shall certify the amount of such additional cost or
reduced amount to Borrowers, which certification shall include a written
explanation of such additional cost or reduction to Borrowers. Such
certification shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. If a Lender claims
any additional cost or reduced amount pursuant to this Section 3.8, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different lending office or to file any certificate
or document reasonably requested by ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, if the
making of such designation or filing would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, any such additional cost or reduced amount and would not, in the sole
discretion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     3.9   Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate.  In the event that
Agent or any Lender shall have determined that:

                 (i)    reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR
     for any Interest Period; or

                 (ii)   Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the
     relevant maturity are not available in the London interbank market with
     respect to a proposed LIBOR Portion, or a proposed conversion of a Base
     Rate Portion into a LIBOR Portion; then

Agent or such Lender shall give Borrowers prompt written, telephonic or
electronic notice of the determination of such effect. If such notice is given,
(i) any such requested LIBOR Portion shall be made as a Base Rate Portion,
unless ETI, on behalf of each Borrower, shall notify Agent no later than 10:00
a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such
proposed borrowing that the request for such borrowing shall be canceled or made
as an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion, and (ii) any Base Rate Portion which was
to have been converted to an affected type of LIBOR Portion shall be continued
as or converted into a Base Rate Portion, or, if ETI, on behalf of each
Borrower, shall notify Agent, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time)
three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as
an unaffected type of LIBOR Portion.

     3.10  Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) on account of any Loan made by it in excess of its ratable share
of payments on account of Loans made by all Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith
purchase from each other Lender such participation in such Loan as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably
with each other Lender; provided, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from
each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lenders the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an
amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the

                                       18

<PAGE>

purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Borrowers agree
that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to
this Section 3.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in
the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, all purchases and repayments to be made under this Section
3.10 shall be made through Agent.

                         SECTION 4. TERM AND TERMINATION

     4.1   Term of Agreement. Subject to the right of Lenders to cease making
Loans to Borrowers during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default,
this Agreement shall be in effect for a period through and including August 20,
2005 (the "Term"), unless terminated as provided in Section 4.2 hereof.

     4.2   Termination.

           4.2.1      Termination by Lenders. Agent may, and at the direction of
Majority Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement without notice upon or after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.

           4.2.2      Termination by Borrowers. Upon at least 90 days prior
written notice to Agent and Lenders, Borrowers may, at their option, terminate
this Agreement; provided, however, no such termination shall be effective until
Borrowers have paid or collateralized to Agent's satisfaction all of the
Obligations in immediately available funds, all Letters of Credit and LC
Guaranties have expired, terminated or have been cash collateralized to Agent's
satisfaction and Borrowers have complied with Section 2.6 and subsection 3.2.5.
Any notice of termination given by Borrowers shall be irrevocable unless all
Lenders otherwise agree in writing and no Lender shall have any obligation to
make any Loans or issue or procure any Letters of Credit or LC Guaranties on or
after the termination date stated in such notice. Borrowers may elect to
terminate this Agreement in its entirety only. No section of this Agreement or
type of Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly.

           4.2.3      Effect of Termination. All of the Obligations shall be
immediately due and payable upon the termination date stated in any notice of
termination of this Agreement. All undertakings, agreements, covenants,
warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Loan Documents
shall survive any such termination and Agent shall retain its Liens in the
Collateral and Agent and each Lender shall retain all of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Documents notwithstanding such termination until all Obligations
have been discharged or paid, in full, in immediately available funds,
including, without limitation, all Obligations under Section 2.6 and subsection
3.2.5 resulting from such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the
payment in full of the Obligations, Agent shall not be required to terminate its
Liens in the Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or damage Agent may
incur as a result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by
Agent from any Borrower or any Account Debtor and applied to the Obligations,
Agent shall, at its option, (i) have received a written agreement satisfactory
to Agent, executed by Borrowers and by any Person whose loans or other advances
to Borrowers are used in whole or in part to satisfy the Obligations,
indemnifying Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage or (ii) have
retained cash Collateral or other

                                       19

<PAGE>

Collateral for such period of time as Agent, in its discretion, may deem
necessary to protect Agent and each Lender from any such loss or damage.

                          SECTION 5. SECURITY INTERESTS

     5.1   Security Interest in Collateral. To secure the prompt payment and
performance to Agent and each Lender of the Obligations, each Borrower hereby
grants to Agent for the benefit of itself and each Lender a continuing Lien upon
all of such Borrower's assets, including all of the following Property and
interests in Property of such Borrower, whether now owned or existing or
hereafter created, acquired or arising and wheresoever located:

     of the foregoing;

property relating to, used or useful in connection with, or evidencing,
embodying, incorporating or referring to any of the foregoing, and all Proceeds,
products, offspring, rents, issues, profits and returns of and from any of the
foregoing.

     5.2   Other Collateral.

           5.2.1      Commercial Tort Claims. Borrowers shall promptly notify
Agent in writing upon any Borrower incurring or otherwise obtaining a Commercial
Tort Claim after the Closing Date against any third party and, upon request of
Agent, promptly enter into an amendment to this Agreement and do such other acts
or things deemed appropriate by Agent to give Agent a security interest in any
such Commercial Tort Claim. Borrowers represent and warrant that as of the date
of this Agreement, to their knowledge, no Borrower possesses any Commercial Tort
Claims.

           5.2.2      Other Collateral. Borrowers shall promptly notify Agent in
writing upon any Borrower acquiring or otherwise obtaining any Collateral after
the date hereof consisting of Deposit Accounts, Investment Property,
Letter-of-Credit Rights or Electronic Chattel Paper and, upon the request of
Agent, promptly execute such other documents, and do such other acts or things
deemed appropriate by Agent to deliver to Agent control with respect to such
Collateral; promptly notify Agent in writing upon any Borrower acquiring or
otherwise obtaining any Collateral after the date hereof consisting of Documents
or Instruments and, upon the request of Agent, will promptly execute such other
documents, and do such other acts or things deemed appropriate by Agent to
deliver to Agent possession of such Documents which are negotiable and
Instruments, and, with respect to nonnegotiable Documents, to have such
nonnegotiable Documents issued in the name of Agent; and with respect to
Collateral in the possession of a third party, other than Certificated
Securities and Goods covered by a Document, obtain an acknowledgement from the
third party that it is holding the Collateral for the benefit of Agent.

     5.3   Lien Perfection; Further Assurances. Each Borrower shall execute such
UCC-1 financing statements as are required by the UCC and such other
instruments, assignments or

                                       21

<PAGE>

documents as are necessary to perfect Agent's Lien upon any of the Collateral
and shall take such other action as may be required to perfect or to continue
the perfection of Agent's Lien upon the Collateral. Unless prohibited by
applicable law, Borrowers hereby authorize Agent to execute and file any such
financing statement, including, without limitation, financing statements that
indicate the Collateral (i) as all assets of any Borrower or words of similar
effect, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater or lesser
detail, than as set forth in Section 5.1, on any Borrower's behalf. Each
Borrower also hereby ratifies its authorization for Agent to have filed in any
jurisdiction any like financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior
to the date hereof. The parties agree that a carbon, photographic or other
reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement and
may be filed in any appropriate office in lieu thereof. At Agent's request, each
Borrower shall also promptly execute or cause to be executed and shall deliver
to Agent any and all documents, instruments and agreements deemed necessary by
Agent, to give effect to or carry out the terms or intent of the Loan Documents.

     5.4   Lien on Realty. The due and punctual payment and performance of the
Obligations shall also be secured by the Lien created by the Mortgages upon all
real Property of any Borrower described therein. If any Borrower shall acquire
at any time or times hereafter any fee simple interest in other real Property
(other than leasehold interests in sales offices or warehouses), such Borrower
agrees promptly to execute and deliver to Agent, for its benefit and the ratable
benefit of Lenders, as additional security and Collateral for the Obligations,
deeds of trust, security deeds, mortgages or other collateral assignments
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Agent and its counsel (herein
collectively referred to as "New Mortgages") covering such real Property. The
Mortgages and each New Mortgage shall be duly recorded (at Borrowers' expense)
in each office where such recording is required to constitute a valid Lien on
the real Property covered thereby. In respect to any Mortgage or any New
Mortgage, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to Agent, at Borrowers' expense,
mortgagee title insurance policies issued by a title insurance company
reasonably satisfactory to Agent, which policies shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Agent and shall insure a valid Lien in favor of Agent
for the benefit of itself and each Lender on the Property covered thereby,
subject only to Permitted Liens and those other exceptions reasonably acceptable
to Agent and its counsel. The applicable Borrower shall also deliver to Agent
such other usual and customary documents, including, without limitation, ALTA
Surveys of the real Property described in the Mortgages or any New Mortgage, as
Agent and its counsel may reasonably request relating to the real Property
subject to the Mortgages or the New Mortgages.

                      SECTION 6. COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION

     6.1   General.

           6.1.1      Location of Collateral. All Collateral, other than
Inventory in transit and motor vehicles, will at all times be kept by each
Borrower and its Subsidiaries at one or more of the business locations set forth
in Exhibit 6.1.1 hereto, as updated by Borrowers providing prior written notice
to Agent of any new location.

           6.1.2      Insurance of Collateral. Borrowers shall maintain and pay
for insurance upon all Collateral wherever located and with respect to the
business of Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries, covering casualty, hazard,
public liability, workers' compensation and such

                                       22

<PAGE>

other risks in such amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably
satisfactory to Agent. Borrowers shall deliver certified copies of such policies
to Agent as promptly as practicable, with satisfactory lender's loss payable
endorsements, naming Agent as a loss payee, assignee or additional insured, as
appropriate, as its interest may appear, and showing only such other loss
payees, assignees and additional insureds as are satisfactory to Agent. Each
policy of insurance or endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer
to give not less than 10 days' prior written notice to Agent in the event of
cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium and not less than 30 days'
prior written notice to Agent in the event of cancellation of the policy for any
other reason whatsoever and a clause specifying that the interest of Agent shall
not be impaired or invalidated by any act or neglect of any Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or the owner of the Property or by the occupation of the premises
for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by said policy. Borrowers agree
to deliver to Agent, promptly as rendered, true copies of all reports made in
any reporting forms to insurance companies. All proceeds of business
interruption insurance (if any) of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries shall be
remitted to Agent for application to the outstanding balance of the Revolving
Credit Loans.

           Unless Borrowers provide Agent with evidence of the insurance
coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may purchase insurance at Borrowers'
expense to protect Agent's interests in the Properties of Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries. This insurance may, but need not, protect the interests of
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. The coverage that Agent purchases may not pay
any claim that any Borrower or any Subsidiary makes or any claim that is made
against any Borrower or any such Subsidiary in connection with said Property.
Borrowers may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only after
providing Agent with evidence that Borrowers and their Subsidiaries have
obtained insurance as required by this Agreement. If Agent purchases insurance,
Borrowers will be responsible for the costs of that insurance, including
interest and any other charges Agent may impose in connection with the placement
of insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the
insurance. The costs of the insurance may be added to the Obligations. The costs
of the insurance may be more than the cost of insurance that Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries may be able to obtain on their own.

           6.1.3      Protection of Collateral. Neither Agent nor any Lender
shall be liable or responsible in any way for the safekeeping of any of the
Collateral or for any loss or damage thereto (except for reasonable care in the
custody thereof while any Collateral is in Agent's or any Lender's actual
possession) or for any diminution in the value thereof, or for any act or
default of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, or other person
whomsoever, but the same shall be at Borrowers' sole risk.

     6.2   Administration of Accounts.

           6.2.1      Records, Schedules and Assignments of Accounts. Borrowers
shall keep accurate and complete records of their Accounts and all payments and
collections thereon and shall submit to Agent on such periodic basis as Agent
shall request a sales and collections report for the preceding period, in form
acceptable to Agent. Monthly, on or prior to the 15th day of each month for the
immediately prior month, or more frequently as requested by Agent, from and
after the date hereof, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent a detailed aged trial
balance of all of its Accounts, specifying the names, addresses, face values,
dates of invoices and due dates for

                                       23

<PAGE>

each Account Debtor obligated on an Account so listed ("Schedule of Accounts"),
and upon Agent's request therefor, copies of proof of delivery and the original
copy of all documents, including, without limitation, repayment histories and
present status reports relating to the Accounts so scheduled and such other
matters and information relating to the status of then existing Accounts as
Agent shall request. If requested by Agent, Borrowers shall execute and deliver
to Agent formal written assignments of all of its Accounts weekly or daily,
which shall include all Accounts that have been created since the date of the
last assignment, together with copies of invoices or invoice registers related
thereto.

           6.2.2      Discounts, Allowances, Disputes. If any Borrower grants
any discounts, allowances or credits that are not shown on the face of the
invoice for the Account involved, Borrowers shall report such discounts,
allowances or credits, as the case may be, to Agent as part of the next required
Schedule of Accounts.

           6.2.3      Account Verification. Any of Agent's officers, employees
or agents shall have the right, at any time or times hereafter, in the name of
Agent, any designee of Agent or any Borrower, to verify the validity, amount or
any other matter relating to any Accounts by mail, telephone, electronic
communication or otherwise. Borrowers shall cooperate fully with Agent in an
effort to facilitate and promptly conclude any such verification process.

           6.2.4      Maintenance of Dominion Account. Borrowers shall maintain
a Dominion Account or Accounts pursuant to lockbox and blocked account
arrangements acceptable to Agent with (x) for the period prior to June 30, 2003,
such banks as may be selected by Borrowers and be acceptable to Agent and (y)
for the period on and after July 1, 2003, Bank. Borrowers shall issue to any
such banks an irrevocable letter of instruction directing such banks to deposit
all payments or other remittances received in the lockbox and blocked accounts
to the Dominion Account for application on account of the Obligations as
provided in subsection 3.2.1. All funds deposited in any Dominion Account shall
immediately become the property of Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders,
and Borrowers shall obtain the agreement by such banks in favor of Agent to
waive any recoupment, setoff rights, and any security interest in, or against,
the funds so deposited. Agent assumes no responsibility for such lockbox and
blocked account arrangements, including, without limitation, any claim of accord
and satisfaction or release with respect to deposits accepted by any bank
thereunder.

           6.2.5      Collection of Accounts, Proceeds of Collateral. Borrowers
agree that all invoices rendered and other requests made by any Borrower for
payment in respect of Accounts shall contain a written statement directing
payment in respect of such Accounts to be paid to a lockbox established pursuant
to subsection 6.2.4. To expedite collection, Borrowers shall endeavor in the
first instance to make collection of its Accounts for Agent. All remittances
received by any Borrower on account of Accounts, together with the proceeds of
any other Collateral, shall be held as Agent's property, for its benefit and the
benefit of Lenders, by Borrowers as trustee of an express trust for Agent's
benefit and Borrowers shall immediately deposit same in kind in the Dominion
Account. Agent retains the right at all times after the occurrence and during
the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default to notify Account Debtors
that Borrowers' Accounts have been assigned to Agent and to collect Borrowers'
Accounts directly in its own name, or in the name of Agent's agent, and to
charge the collection costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to
Borrowers.

                                       24

           6.2.6      Taxes. If an Account includes a charge for any tax payable
to any governmental taxing authority, Agent is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to pay the amount thereof to the proper taxing authority for the
account of the applicable Borrower and to charge Borrowers therefor, except for
taxes that (i) are being actively contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which Borrowers maintain reasonable reserves on
their books therefor and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to result in any
Lien other than a Permitted Lien. In no event shall Agent or any Lender be
liable for any taxes to any governmental taxing authority that may be due by any
Borrower.

     6.3   Administration of Inventory. Borrowers shall keep records of their
Inventory which records shall be complete and accurate and complete in all

on at least an annual basis and more often if requested by Agent. Promptly after
the request therefor by Agent, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent any and all
evidence of ownership, if any, of any of their Equipment.

           6.4.2      Dispositions of Equipment. Borrowers shall not, and shall
not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of or
transfer any of its respective Equipment or other fixed assets or any part
thereof without the prior written consent of Agent; provided, however, that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply, for so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists and is continuing, to (i) dispositions of Equipment and other
fixed assets which, in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve-month period,
have a fair market value or a book value, whichever is less, of $50,000 or less,

rights relating to its Intellectual Property, except for such Intellectual
Property rights the loss or impairment of which could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as listed on Exhibit 7.1.16 and except
as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i)
neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of, or default
under, any term of any license or sublicense with respect to any of its
Intellectual Property and (ii) to the knowledge of each Borrower, no other party
to such license or sublicense is in breach thereof or default thereunder, and
such license is valid and enforceable.

           7.1.17     Governmental Consents. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has, and is in good standing with respect to, all governmental
consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, permits, certificates,
inspections and franchises necessary to continue to conduct its business as
heretofore or proposed to be conducted by it and to own or lease and operate its
Properties as now owned or leased by it, except where the failure to possess or
so maintain such rights could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

           7.1.18     Compliance with Laws. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has duly complied, and its Properties, business operations and
leaseholds are in compliance with, the provisions of all federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations applicable to such Borrower or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, its Properties or the conduct of its business, except
for such non-compliance as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and there have been no citations, notices or orders of
noncompliance issued to any Borrower or any

                                       30

<PAGE>

of its Subsidiaries under any such law, rule or regulation, except where such
noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains
an adequate monitoring system to insure that it remains in compliance in all
material respects with all federal, state and local rules, laws and regulations
applicable to it. No Inventory has been produced in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act (29 U.S.C. Section 201 et seq.), as amended.

           7.1.19     Restrictions. Neither any Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or subject to any contract or agreement which restricts
its right or ability to incur Indebtedness, other than as set forth on Exhibit
7.1.19 hereto, none of which prohibit the execution of or compliance with this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents by any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

           7.1.20     Litigation. Except as set forth on Exhibit 7.1.20 hereto,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending, or to the
knowledge of Borrowers, threatened, against or affecting any Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, or the business, operations, Properties, prospects, profits or
condition of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, singly or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default with respect to
any order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree or rule of any court, governmental
authority or arbitration board or tribunal, which, singly or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

           7.1.21     No Defaults. No event has occurred and no condition exists
which would, upon or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
Borrowers' performance hereunder, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.
Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in (and no event
has occurred and no condition exists which constitutes, or which the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute, a default in) the payment
of any Indebtedness to any Person for Money Borrowed in excess of $250,000.

           7.1.22     Leases. Exhibit 7.1.22 hereto is a complete listing of all
capitalized and operating personal property leases of Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries and all real property leases of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries.
Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in full compliance with all of the
terms of each of its respective capitalized and operating leases, except where
the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

           7.1.23     Pension Plans. Except as disclosed on Exhibit 7.1.23
hereto, neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Plan. Each
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the requirements of
ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to each Plan,
except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No fact or situation that could reasonably be expected
to result in a material adverse change in the financial condition of Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries exists in connection with any Plan. Neither any Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any withdrawal liability in connection with a
Multiemployer Plan.

                                       31

<PAGE>

           7.1.24     Trade Relations. There exists no actual or, to any
Borrower's knowledge, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation of, or
any modification or change in, the business relationship between any Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries and any customer or any group of customers whose
purchases individually or in the aggregate are material to the business of
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, or with any material supplier, except in each
case, where the same could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and there exists no present condition or state of facts or circumstances
which would prevent any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from conducting such
business after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in substantially the same manner in which it has heretofore been
conducted.

           7.1.25     Labor Relations. Except as described on Exhibit 7.1.25
hereto, as of the date hereof, neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any collective bargaining agreement. There are no material
grievances, disputes or controversies with any union or any other organization
of any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' employees, or threats of strikes,
work stoppages or any asserted pending demands for collective bargaining by any
union or organization, except those that could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

           7.1.26     Acquisition. The Acquisition has been consummated pursuant
to the terms of the Acquisition Documents and in compliance with all applicable
laws.

           7.1.27     Related Businesses. Borrowers are engaged in the
businesses of the manufacture and distribution of plastic pipe as of the Closing
Date, as well as in certain other businesses. These operations require financing
on a basis such that the credit supplied can be made available from time to time
to Borrowers, as required for the continued successful operation of Borrowers
taken as a whole. Borrowers have requested the Lenders to make credit available
hereunder primarily for the purposes of subsection 1.1.3 and generally for the
purposes of financing the operations of Borrowers. Each Borrower and each
Subsidiary of each Borrower expects to derive benefit (and the Board of
Directors of each Borrower and each Subsidiary of each Borrower has determined
that such Borrower or Subsidiary may reasonably be expected to derive benefit),
directly or indirectly, from a portion of the credit extended by Lenders
hereunder, both in its separate capacity and as a member of the group of
companies, since the successful operation and condition of each Borrower and
each Subsidiary of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful
performance of the functions of the group as a whole. Each Borrower acknowledges
that, but for the agreement of each of the other Borrowers to execute and
deliver this Agreement, Agent and Lenders would not have made available the
credit facilities established hereby on the terms set forth herein.

     7.2   Continuous Nature of Representations and Warranties. Each
representation and warranty contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be continuous in nature and shall remain accurate, complete and
not misleading at all times during the term of this Agreement, except for
changes in the nature of Borrowers' or one of any Borrower's Subsidiary's
business or operations that would render the information in any exhibit attached
hereto or to any other Loan Document either inaccurate, incomplete or
misleading, so long as Majority Lenders have consented to such changes or such
changes are expressly permitted by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Loan request made or

                                       32

<PAGE>

deemed made pursuant to subsection 3.1.1 hereof shall constitute Borrowers'
reaffirmation, as of the date of each such loan request, of each representation,
warranty or other statement made or furnished to Agent or any Lender by or on
behalf of any Borrower, any Subsidiary of any Borrower, or any Guarantor in this
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any instrument, certificate or
financial statement furnished in compliance with or in reference thereto.

     7.3   Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties of Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance thereof by Agent
and each Lender and the parties thereto and the closing of the transactions
described therein or related thereto.

                 SECTION 8. COVENANTS AND CONTINUING AGREEMENTS

     8.1   Affirmative  Covenants.  During the Term, and thereafter for so long
as there are any Obligations outstanding, each Borrower covenants that, unless
otherwise consented to by Majority Lenders, in writing, it shall:

           8.1.1      Visits and Inspections; Lender Meeting. Permit (i)
representatives of Agent, and during the continuation of any Default or Event of
Default any Lender, from time to time, as often as may be reasonably requested,
but only during normal business hours, to visit and inspect the Properties of
each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, inspect, audit and make extracts
from its books and records, and discuss with its officers, its employees and its
independent accountants, each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiaries' business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, business prospects and results of
operations and (ii) appraisers engaged pursuant to Section 2.10 (whether or not
personnel of Agent), from time to time, as often as may be reasonably requested,
but only during normal business hours and subject to the limitations contained
in Section 2.10 of the Agreement, to visit and inspect the Properties of each
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, for the purpose of completing appraisals
pursuant to Section 2.10. Agent, if no Default or Event of Default then exists,
shall give Borrowers reasonable prior notice of any such inspection or audit.
Without limiting the foregoing, Borrowers will participate and will cause their
key management personnel to participate in a meeting with Agent and Lenders
periodically during each year, which meeting(s) shall be held at such times and
such places as may be reasonably requested by Agent.

           8.1.2      Notices. Promptly notify Agent in writing of the
occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact which renders any
representation or warranty in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
inaccurate, incomplete or misleading in any material respect as of the date made
or remade. In addition, Borrowers agree to provide Agent with prompt written
notice of any change in the information disclosed in any Exhibit hereto (other
than changes which are expressly permitted by this Agreement), in each case
after giving effect to the materiality limits and Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein.

           8.1.3      Financial Statements. Keep, and cause each of its
Subsidiaries to keep, adequate records and books of account with respect to its
business activities in which proper entries are made in accordance with
customary accounting practices reflecting all its financial transactions; and
cause to be prepared and furnished to Agent and each Lender, the following, all
to be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, unless
ETI's certified

                                       33

<PAGE>

public accountants concur in any change therein and such change is
disclosed to Agent and is consistent with GAAP:

                 (i)    not later than 90 days after the close of each fiscal
     year of ETI, unqualified (except for a qualification for a change in
     accounting principles with which the accountant concurs) audited financial
     statements of ETI and its Subsidiaries as of the end of such year, on a
     Consolidated and consolidating basis, certified by a firm of independent
     certified public accountants of recognized standing selected by ETI but
     acceptable to Agent and, within a reasonable time thereafter a copy of any
     management letter issued in connection therewith;

                 (ii)   not later than 30 days after the end of each month
     hereafter, including the last month of ETI's fiscal year, unaudited interim
     financial statements of ETI and its Subsidiaries as of the end of such
     month and of the portion of the fiscal year then elapsed, on a
     Consolidating and consolidated basis, certified by the principal financial
     officer of ETI as prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly presenting in
     all material respects the financial position and results of operations of
     ETI and its Subsidiaries for such month and period subject only to changes
     from audit and year-end adjustments and except that such statements need
     not contain notes;

                 (iii)  together with each delivery of financial statements
     pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection 8.1.3 and clause (ii) of this
     subsection 8.1.3 for the months of March, June, September and December, a
     management report (1) setting forth in comparative form the corresponding
     figures for the corresponding periods of the previous fiscal year and the
     corresponding figures from the most recent Projections for the current
     fiscal year delivered pursuant to subsection 8.1.7 and (2) identifying the
     reasons for any significant variations. The information above shall be
     presented in reasonable detail and shall be certified by the chief
     financial officer of ETI to the effect that such information fairly
     presents in all material respects the results of operation and financial
     condition of ETI and its Subsidiaries as at the dates and for the periods
     indicated;

                 (iv)   promptly after the sending or filing thereof, as the
     case may be, copies of any proxy statements, financial statements or
     reports which ETI has made available to its Securities holders and copies
     of any regular, periodic and special reports or registration statements
     which ETI or any of its Subsidiaries files with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission or any governmental authority which may be substituted therefor,
     or any national securities exchange;

                 (v)    upon request of Agent, copies of any annual report to be
     filed with ERISA in connection with each Plan; and

                 (vi)   such other data and information (financial and
     otherwise) as Agent or any Lender, from time to time, may reasonably
     request, bearing upon or related to the Collateral or ETI's or any of its
     Subsidiaries' financial condition or results of operations.

                                       34

<PAGE>

     The foregoing notwithstanding, Agent and Lenders agree that in respect to
operating divisions, Borrower shall only be required to deliver income
statements pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above.

           Concurrently with the delivery of the financial statements
described in clause (i) of this subsection 8.1.3, ETI shall forward to Agent a
copy of the accountants' letter to ETI's management that is prepared in
connection with such financial statements and also shall cause to be prepared
and shall furnish to Agent a certificate of the aforesaid certified public
accountants certifying to Agent that, based upon their examination of the
financial statements of ETI and its Subsidiaries performed in connection with
their examination of said financial statements, they are not aware of any
Default or Event of Default, or, if they are aware of such Default or Event of
Default, specifying the nature thereof. Concurrently with the delivery of the
financial statements described in paragraph (i) and (ii) of this subsection
8.1.3, or more frequently if reasonably requested by Agent, ETI shall cause to
be prepared and furnished to Agent a Compliance Certificate in the form of
Exhibit 8.1.3 hereto executed by the Chief Financial Officer of ETI (a
"Compliance Certificate").

           8.1.4      Borrowing Base Certificates. On or before each Tuesday of
each week from and after the date hereof, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent, in
form acceptable to Agent, a weekly Borrowing Base Certificate as of the last day
of the immediately preceding week, with such supporting materials as Agent shall
reasonably request. If Borrowers deem it advisable, or Agent shall request,
Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Agent Borrowing Base Certificates more
frequently than weekly.

           8.1.5      Landlord, Processor and Storage Agreements. Provide Agent
with copies of all agreements between any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
and any landlord, warehouseman, processor, distributor or consignee which owns
or is the lessee of any premises at which any Collateral may, from time to time,
be kept. With respect to any lease (other than leases for sales offices),
warehousing agreement or any processing agreement in any case entered into after
the Closing Date, Borrowers shall provide Agent with landlord waivers, bailee
letters or processor letters with respect to such premises. Such landlord
waivers, bailee letters or processor letters shall be in a form supplied by
Agent to Borrowers with such reasonable revisions as are customarily accepted by
Agent or by similar financial institutions in similar financial transactions. In
the event that any Borrower fails to deliver any such landlord waiver, bailee
letter or processor letter with respect to applicable location, Borrower
acknowledges that Agent shall have the right to establish reserves pursuant to
subsection 1.1.1 to protect against any claim of any such landlord, bailee or
processor. Borrowers acknowledge that the initial amount of reserves established
by Agent to protect against claims of the landlord for Borrowers' Conroe, Texas
and Mt. Sterling Kentucky facilities shall be $342,000.

           8.1.6      Projections. No later than 30 days prior to the end of
each fiscal year of ETI, deliver to Agent Projections of ETI and each of its
Subsidiaries for the forthcoming fiscal year, month by month.

           8.1.7      Subsidiaries. Cause each Subsidiary of any Borrower (other

request therefor, to execute and deliver to Agent a Guaranty Agreement and a
security agreement pursuant to which

                                       35

<PAGE>

such Subsidiary guaranties the payment of all Obligations and grants to Agent a
first priority Lien (subject only to Permitted Liens) on all of its Properties
of the types described in Section 5.1. Additionally, the applicable Borrower
shall execute and deliver to Agent a pledge agreement pursuant to which such
Borrower grants to Agent a first priority Lien (subject only to Permitted Liens)
with respect to all of the issued and outstanding Securities of each such
Subsidiary.

           8.1.8      Deposit and Brokerage Accounts. For each deposit account
or brokerage account that any Borrower at any time opens or maintains, such
Borrower shall, at Agent's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, cause the depository bank or
securities intermediary, as applicable, to agree to comply at any time with
instructions from Agent to such depository bank or securities intermediary, as
applicable, directing the disposition of funds from time to time credited to
such deposit or brokerage account, without further consent of Borrower.

           8.1.9      Interest Rate Protection. On or prior to April 1, 2003,
Borrowers shall obtain from Bank and thereafter maintain with Bank interest rate
protection in form and on terms acceptable to Agent for a notional amount of not
less than $2,500,000.

           8.1.10     Cash Management Services. Prior to June 30, 2003,
Borrowers shall enter into and maintain with Bank agreements for all or
substantially all of each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiaries' controlled

shall have entered into a Supply Contract (or other comparable agreement) (the
"Supply Contract") with [___________], in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Agent, which Supply Contract shall provide, inter alia, that ETI
and PW and their Subsidiaries shall have [________] payment terms for the period
from the Closing Date through August 20, 2005 and for credit limits in amounts
at least as large as available to Uponor ETI Company and PW prior to the Closing
Date.

           8.1.12     Environmental Reviews. Complete or cause to be completed

there are any Obligations outstanding, each Borrower covenants that, unless
otherwise consented to by Majority Lenders, in writing, it shall not:

other similar advances in the ordinary course of business) to any Person.

           8.2.3      Total Indebtedness. Create, incur, assume, or suffer to
exist, or permit any Subsidiary of any Borrower to create, incur or suffer to

                      (ii)   Indebtedness of any Subsidiary of a Borrower to a

     course of business and paid within such time period, unless the same are
     being actively contested in good faith and by appropriate and lawful
     proceedings; and such Borrower or such Subsidiary shall have set aside such
     reserves, if any, with respect thereto as are required by GAAP and deemed
     adequate by such Borrower or such Subsidiary and its independent

           8.2.4      Affiliate Transactions. Enter into, or be a party to, or
permit any Subsidiary of any Borrower to enter into or be a party to, any
transaction with any Affiliate of any Borrower or any holder of any Securities
of any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower, including without limitation
any management, consulting or similar fees, except in the ordinary course of and
pursuant to the reasonable requirements of such Borrower's or such Subsidiary's
business and upon fair and reasonable terms which are fully disclosed to Agent
and are no less favorable to such Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be
obtained in a comparable arms-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate
or Security holder of any Borrower. In addition to the foregoing, with respect
to any purchase, sale or exchange of goods or services between ETI and any of
its Subsidiaries on the one part and PW and its Subsidiaries (other than ETI and
its Subsidiaries) on the other part, (x) each such purchase, sale or exchange
shall be effected at fair market prices, (y) each such sale, purchase or
exchange shall have payment terms of 30 days or less and (z) the aggregate
outstanding amounts owed by Borrowers and their Subsidiaries to PW and its
Subsidiaries (other than Borrowers and their Subsidiaries), or vice versa, shall

foregoing, Borrowers and their Subsidiaries may enter into a tax sharing
agreement with PW and its Subsidiaries and may make payments to PW to satisfy
Borrowers' and their Subsidiaries' tax obligations with respect thereto;
provided that such tax obligations payable by Borrowers and their Subsidiaries
with respect thereto do not exceed the amount of tax obligations Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries would pay on a stand-alone basis.

           8.2.5      Limitation on Liens. Create or suffer to exist, or permit
any Subsidiary of any Borrower to create or suffer to exist, any Lien upon any
of its Property, income or profits, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
except:

                      (i)    Liens at any time granted in favor of Agent for its
     benefit and the ratable benefit of Lenders;

                      (ii)   Liens for taxes (excluding any Lien imposed
     pursuant to any of the provisions of ERISA) not yet due, or being contested
     in the manner described in Section 7.1.14 hereto, but only if in Agent's
     judgment such Lien does not adversely affect Agent's or Lenders' rights or
     the priority of Agent's Lien in the Collateral;

                      (iii)  Liens arising in the ordinary course of any
     Borrower's business by operation of law or regulation or to secure the
     performance of contracts (other than for Funded Debt), statutory
     obligations, surety, appeal bonds or the like, but only if payment in
     respect of any such Lien is not at the time required and such Liens do not,
     in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of the Property of any

           10.3.1     All of the rights and remedies of a secured party under
the UCC or under other applicable law, and all other legal and equitable rights
to which Agent or Lenders may be entitled, all of which rights and remedies
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and none of
which shall be exclusive.

           10.3.2     The right to take immediate possession of the Collateral,
and to (i) require Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries to assemble the
Collateral, at Borrowers' expense, and make it available to Agent at a place
designated by Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, and (ii)
enter any premises where any of the Collateral shall be located and to keep and
store the Collateral on said premises until sold (and if said premises be the
Property of a Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower, such Borrower agrees not
to charge, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to charge, Agent for storage
thereof).

           10.3.3     The right to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
Collateral in its then condition, or after any further manufacturing or
processing thereof, at public or private sale or sales, with such notice as may
be required by law, in lots or in bulk, for cash or on credit, all as Agent, in
its sole discretion, may deem advisable. Agent may, at Agent's option, disclaim
any and all warranties regarding the Collateral in connection with any such
sale. Borrowers agree that 10 days' written notice to Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries of any public or private sale or other disposition of Collateral
shall be reasonable notice thereof, and such sale shall be at such locations as
Agent may designate in said notice. Agent shall have the right to conduct such
sales on any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' premises, without charge
therefor, and such sales may be adjourned from time to time in accordance with
applicable law. Agent shall have the right to sell, lease or otherwise dispose
of the Collateral, or any part thereof, for cash, credit or any combination
thereof, and Agent, on behalf of Lenders, may purchase all or any part of the
Collateral at public or, if permitted by law, private sale and, in lieu of
actual payment of such purchase price, may set off the amount of such price
against the Obligations. The proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral
may be applied, after allowing 2 Business Days for

                                       45

<PAGE>

collection, first to the costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by Agent
in collecting the Obligations, in enforcing the rights of Agent and Lenders
under the Loan Documents and in collecting, retaking, completing, protecting,
removing, storing, advertising for sale, selling and delivering any Collateral,
second to the interest due upon any of the Obligations; and third, to the
principal of the Obligations. If any deficiency shall arise, each Borrower and
each Guarantor (if any) shall remain jointly and severally liable to Agent and
Lenders therefor.

           10.3.4     Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use,
without charge, each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiary's labels, patents,
copyrights, licenses, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names,
trademarks and advertising matter, or any Property of a similar nature, as it
pertains to the Collateral, in completing, advertising for sale and selling any
Collateral and each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiary's rights under all
licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to Agent's benefit.

           10.3.5     Agent may, at its option, require Borrowers to deposit
with Agent funds equal to the LC Amount and, if Borrowers fail to promptly make
such deposit, Agent may advance such amount as a Revolving Credit Loan (whether
or not an Overadvance is created thereby). Each such Revolving Credit Loan shall
be secured by all of the Collateral and shall constitute a Base Rate Revolving
Portion. Any such deposit or advance shall be held by Agent as a reserve to fund
future payments on such LC Guaranties and future drawings against such Letters
of Credit. At such time as all LC Guaranties have been paid or terminated and
all Letters of Credit have been drawn upon or expired, any amounts remaining in
such reserve shall be applied against any outstanding Obligations, or, if all
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, returned to Borrowers.

     10.4  Set Off and Sharing of Payments. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby
authorized by Borrowers at any time or from time to time, with prior written
consent of Agent and with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to Borrowers (any
prior or contemporaneous notice to Borrowers being hereby expressly waived) to
set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (i) balances held by such
Lender at any of its offices for the account of any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Borrower
or its Subsidiaries), and (ii) other property at any time held or owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or for the account of any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, against and on account of any of the Obligations. Any Lender
exercising a right to set off shall, to the extent the amount of any such set
off exceeds its Revolving Loan Percentage of the amount set off, purchase for
cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests in each such other Lender's
pro rata share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to
share such excess with each other Lender in accordance with their respective
Revolving Loan Percentages. Each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, that any Lender may exercise its right to set off with respect
to amounts in excess of its pro rata share of the Obligations and upon doing so
shall deliver such excess to Agent for the benefit of all Lenders in accordance
with each such Lender's Aggregate Percentage.

     10.5  Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver. All covenants, conditions,
provisions, warranties, guaranties, indemnities, and other undertakings of
Borrowers contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in any
document referred to herein or contained in

                                       46

<PAGE>

any agreement supplementary hereto or in any schedule or in any Guaranty
Agreement given to Agent or any Lender or contained in any other agreement
between any Lender and any Borrower or between Agent and any Borrower
heretofore, concurrently, or hereafter entered into, shall be deemed cumulative
to and not in derogation or substitution of any of the terms, covenants,
conditions, or agreements of any Borrower herein contained. The failure or delay
of Agent or any Lender to require strict performance by any Borrower of any
provision of this Agreement or to exercise or enforce any rights, Liens, powers,
or remedies hereunder or under any of the aforesaid agreements or other
documents or security or Collateral shall not operate as a waiver of such
performance, Liens, rights, powers and remedies, but all such requirements,
Liens, rights, powers, and remedies shall continue in full force and effect
until all Loans and other Obligations owing or to become owing from Borrowers to
Agent and each Lender have been fully satisfied. None of the undertakings,
agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of Borrowers contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and no Default or Event of
Default by Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall be
deemed to have been suspended or waived by Lenders, unless such suspension or
waiver is by an instrument in writing specifying such suspension or waiver and
is signed by a duly authorized representative of Agent and directed to
Borrowers.

                                SECTION 11. AGENT

     11.1  Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes
Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that Agent shall not have by reason of
this Agreement assumed a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely
as agent of Lenders and shall not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, any
obligation toward, or relationship of agency or trust with or for, Borrowers. As
to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including without limitation enforcement and collection of the
Notes), Agent may, but shall not be required to, exercise any discretion or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders, whenever such instruction shall be requested by Agent or
required hereunder, or a greater or lesser number of Lenders if so required
hereunder, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided,
that Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
which exposes Agent to any liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents or applicable law, unless Agent is indemnified to its
satisfaction by the other Lenders against any and all liability and expense
which it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. If
Agent seeks the consent or approval of the Majority Lenders (or a greater or
lesser number of Lenders as required in this Agreement), with respect to any
action hereunder, Agent shall send notice thereof to each Lender and shall
notify each Lender at any time that the Majority Lenders (or such greater or
lesser number of Lenders) have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting
pursuant hereto.

     11.2  Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither Agent, any Affiliate of Agent, nor any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection
with this Agreement or the other Loan

                                       47

<PAGE>

Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, Agent: (i) may treat each
Lender party hereto as the holder of Obligations until Agent receives written
notice of the assignment or transfer or such lender's portion of the Obligations
signed by such Lender and in form reasonably satisfactory to Agent; (ii) may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts, (iii) makes no warranties or representations to any
Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents; (iv) shall not have any duty beyond Agent's customary
practices in respect of loans in which Agent is the only lender, to ascertain or
to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of any
Borrower, to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Borrower, to monitor the financial condition of any Borrower or to ascertain the
existence or possible existence or continuation of any Default or Event of
Default; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vi) shall not be liable to any Lender for
any action taken, or inaction, by Agent upon the instructions of Majority
Lenders pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof or refraining to take any action pending
such instructions; (vii) shall not be liable for any apportionment or
distributions of payments made by it in good faith pursuant to Section 3 hereof;
(viii) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, message or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, facsimile, telegram,
cable or telex) believed in good faith by it to be genuine and signed or sent by
the proper party or parties; and (ix) may assume that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, unless Agent has actual knowledge of the Event of
Default, has received notice from Borrowers or Borrowers' independent certified
public accounts stating the nature of the Event of Default, or has received
notice from a Lender stating the nature of the Event of Default and that such
Lender considers the Event of Default to have occurred and to be continuing. In
the event any apportionment or distribution described in clause (vii) above is
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Person to whom
payment was due but not made shall be to recover from the recipients of such
payments any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to
have been entitled.

     11.3  Fleet and Affiliates. With respect to its commitment hereunder to
make Loans, Fleet shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not Agent; and the terms "Lender," "Lenders" or "Majority Lenders"
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Fleet in its individual
capacity as a Lender. Fleet and its Affiliates may lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of business with, any Borrower, and any Person who may do
business with or own Securities of any Borrower all as if Fleet were not Agent
and without any duty to account therefor to any other Lender.

     11.4  Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on
the financial statements referred to herein and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made

                                       48

<PAGE>

its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement. Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on an ongoing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other similar information regarding Borrowers.

     11.5  Indemnification. Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by Borrowers), in accordance with their respective Aggregate
Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by Agent under this
Agreement; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share, as set forth above,
of any out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiation, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document, to the
extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrowers. The
obligations of Lenders under this Section 11.5 shall survive the payment in full
of all Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. If after payment and
distribution of any amount by Agent to Lenders, any Lender or any other Person,
including Borrowers, any creditor of any Borrower, a liquidator, administrator
or trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from Agent any amount found to have been
wrongfully paid to Agent or disbursed by Agent to Lenders, then Lenders, in
accordance with their respective Aggregate Percentages, shall reimburse Agent
for all such amounts.

     11.6  Rights and Remedies to be Exercised by Agent Only. Each Lender agrees
that, except as set forth in Section 10.4, no Lender shall have any right
individually (i) to realize upon the security created by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, (ii) to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or (iii) to make demand under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document.

     11.7  Agency Provisions Relating to Collateral. Each Lender authorizes and
ratifies Agent's entry into this Agreement and the Security Documents for the
benefit of Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Agent with
respect to the Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or
the Security Documents, and the exercise by Agent of the powers set forth herein
or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Lenders. Agent is hereby
authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or
further consent from any Lender to take any action with respect to any
Collateral or the Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain
perfected Agent's Liens upon the Collateral, for its benefit and the ratable
benefit of Lenders. Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option
and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Agent upon any
Collateral (i) upon termination of the Agreement and payment and satisfaction of

or disposition is made in compliance with subsection 8.2.9 hereof (and Agent may
rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (iii)
constituting property in which any Borrower owned no interest at the time the
Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) in connection with any
foreclosure sale or other disposition of Collateral after the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default; or (v) if approved, authorized
or ratified in writing by Agent at the direction of all Lenders. Upon request by
Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm in writing Agent's authority to release
particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto. Agent shall have no
obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the
Collateral exists or is owned by any Borrower or is cared for, protected or
insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Agent herein or
pursuant to the Security Documents have been properly or sufficiently or
lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any
particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under
any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of its
rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Agent in this Section
11.7 or in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in
respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Agent
may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, but
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including given Agent's own
interest in the Collateral as a Lender and that Agent shall have no duty or
liability whatsoever to any Lender.

     11.8  Agent's Right to Purchase Commitments. Agent shall have the right,
but shall not be obligated, at any time upon written notice to any Lender and

Lender's sole discretion, to purchase for Agent's own account all of such
Lender's interests in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
Obligations, for the face amount of the outstanding Obligations owed to such
Lender, including without limitation all accrued and unpaid interest and fees.

     11.9  Right of Sale, Assignment, Participations. Each Borrower hereby
consents to any Lender's participation, sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition, at any time or times hereafter, of this Agreement and any of the

$3,500 and any out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent in
connection with any such sale or assignment and (v) Agent, the assigning Lender

Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if the originating Lender had not
sold any such participation.

with each Lender in any manner reasonably requested by such Lender to effect the

Lender with respect to any payments to be made to such transferee in respect of
the interest so transferred, (ii) furnish to the transferor Lender, Agent and
