The Trustee shall thereafter immediately notify the Settlor in writing as to the Executive's instructions, and the Settlor shall have thirty days from the date of such notification to object (in the manner indicated below) to the payment requested by the Executive. If no such objection is raised within said period of time, Trustee shall make the applicable distribution to the Executive. With respect to the investment income, the Trustee shall distribute such income to Executive in accordance with the provisions of Article III&amp;ndash;B unless the Settlor furnishes Trustee a written statement providing that an event of default has occurred. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event the Settlor considers that an event of forfeiture has occurred (either with respect to distributions of investment income funds or of funds other than distributions of investment income funds), the Settlor shall be required to so notify it in writing to the Trustee and Executive indicating the reasons for such determination. In the event Executive disagrees with the determination made by the Settlor as to the occurrence of an event of forfeiture, said issue shall be arbitrated before an individual selected by mutual consent of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree as to the appointment of an Arbitrator, then the arbitration proceedings shall take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties and shall be enforceable in any court of law having jurisdiction thereof. Any amount of the Deferred Compensation Truest Account which is considered to have been forfeited, shall be paid (in cash or in kind) by the Trustee to the Settlor within the next THIRTY (30) days following such determination.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Distribution of Investment Income.</LI></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Trust's investment income, including net capital gains, will be paid by Trustee to Executive or to her beneficiaries or estate within the next five days after such income is received by Trustee.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of the deferred portion of the total compensation accumulated by the Trust will be distributed in the manner described below unless forfeited by the occurrence of any of the events of forfeiture specified in Article III&amp;ndash;C below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Trustee shall have the power to decide what will constitute income of the Trust that will be currently distributed and what will constitute corpus of the Trust, and such decision shall be final and binding upon all parties.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event that the Executive's services shall be terminated by reason of disability, retirement, voluntary termination by either party, or for any other reason other than her death, the value of her Deferred Compensation Trust Account maintained by the Trustee as of the date in which the first installment is payable to Executive shall be paid by Trustee to the Executive in the following manner, unless forfeited by the occurrence of any of the events of forfeiture specified in Article IV below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the value of her Deferred Compensation Trust Account does not exceed the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000), then, said value thereof shall be paid to Executive over a five (5) year period in five (5) annual installments commencing on January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of the year following termination of services and continuing on January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of the subsequent four (4) years, or </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such value exceeds the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000), then said value thereof shall be paid to Executive, over a ten (10) year period in ten (10) annual installments commencing on January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of the year following termination of services and continuing on each January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of the subsequent nine (9) years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As provided above, during the pay&amp;ndash;out period, the Trust's income, including net capital gains, will be paid by Trustee to Executive as such income is received by Trustee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of each installment shall be determined by dividing: (i) the value of the Deferred Compensation Trust Account at the date the first installment is payable by, (ii) the total number of installments payable. Any increment in the value of the installments in the deferred compensation trust account during the pay&amp;ndash;out period shall increase the amount of the last installment due and any reduction in the value of investments shall reduce the amount of each installment in reverse order of maturity. The Executive may, however, prior to the date of termination of services for the reasons indicated above, file a written document with the Settlor and Trustee electing:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To receive the unpaid value of her Deferred Compensation Trust Account over a longer period of time, and/or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the annual installments commence at a later date other than the subsequent January 1<SUP>st</SUP> after the date of retirement but no later than her attainment of age sixty (60).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event that the Executive's services are terminated by death, or in the event of Executive's death after termination of services, without the occurrence, in either case, of any of the events of forfeiture specified in Article IV below, the unpaid value of her Deferred Compensation Trust Account shall be paid by Trustee in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after her death to her Estate, or to her designated heirs or beneficiaries thereof as may be provided by law or by a valid will executed by the Executive, unless Executive notifies the Settlor and Trustee in writing at any time that such unpaid value be paid in a lump sum at a designated time within the five (5) year period following the death of the Executive or in ratable annual installments over a five (5) year period or a specified longer period not to exceed ten (10) years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Hardship</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon a showing of financial hardship and provided that none of the events of forfeiture specified in Article IV below has occurred, the Settlor may, in its sole discretion, direct the Trustee to pay the Executive (or, in the event of death, to the Executive's Beneficiaries) in one lump sum a portion or all of the unpaid value of such Executive's Deferred Compensation Trust Account to the extent necessary to alleviate the hardship. A hardship is an emergency beyond the control of the Executive and her beneficiaries.</P>
