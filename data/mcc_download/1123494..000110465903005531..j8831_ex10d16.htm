Property Damage Insurance insuring Lessor and Lessee against any liability
arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and
all areas appurtenant thereto.&#160; Such
insurance shall be a combined single limit policy in an amount not less than
$1,000,000.&#160; The policy shall contain
cross liability endorsements and shall insure performance by Lessee of the
indemnity provisions of this Paragraph 8.&#160;
The limits of said insurance shall not, however, limit the liability of
Lessee hereunder.&#160; In the event that the
Premises constitute a part of a larger property said insurance shall have a
Lessor&#146;s Protective Liability endorsement attached thereto.&#160; If Lessee shall fail to procure and maintain
said insurance Lessor may, but shall not be required to procure and maintain
the same, but at the expense of Lessee.&#160;
Not more frequently than each 5 years, if, in the reasonable opinion of
Lessor, the amount of liability insurance required hereunder is not adequate,
Lessee shall increase said insurance coverage as required by Lessor.&#160; Provided, however that in no event shall the
amount of the liability insurance increase be more than fifty percent greater
than the amount thereof during the preceding five years of the term of this
lease.&#160; However, the failure of Lessor
to require any additional insurance coverage shall not be deemed to relieve
Lessee from any obligations under this Lease.</p>

Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee to Lessor of rent

processing and accounting charges, and late charges which may be imposed on
Lessor by the terms of any mortgage or trust deed covering the Premises.&#160; Accordingly, if any installment of rent or
any other sum due from Lessee shall not be received by Lessor or Lessor&#146;s
designee within ten (10) days after such amount shall be due, Lessee shall pay
to Lessor a late charge equal to 5% of such overdue amount.&#160; The parties hereby agree that such late
charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur
by reason of late payment by Lessee.&#160;
Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a
waiver of Lessee&#146;s default with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent
Lessor from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.</p>

If the Premises or any portion thereof are taken under the power of
eminent domain, or sold under the threat of the exercise of said power (all of
which are herein called &#147;condemnation&#148;), this Lease shall terminate as to the
part so taken as of the date the condemning authority takes title or
possession, whichever first occurs.&#160; If
more than 10% of the floor area of the improvements on the Premises, or more
than 25% of the land area of the Premises which is not occupied by any
improvements, is taken by condemnation, Lessee may, at Lessee&#146;s option, to be
exercised in writing only within ten (10) days after Lessor shall have given
Lessee written notice of such taking (or in the absence of such notice, within
ten (10) days after the condemning authority shall have taken possession)
terminate this Lease as of the date the condemning authority takes such
possession.&#160; If Lessee does not
terminate this Lease in accordance with the foregoing, this Lease shall remain
in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining, except
that the rent shall be reduced in the proportion that the floor area taken
bears to the total floor area of the building situated on the Premises.&#160; Any award for the taking of all or any part
of the Premises under the power of eminent domain or any payment made under
threat of the exercise of such power shall be the property of Lessor, whether
such award shall be made as compensation for diminution in value of the
leasehold or for the taking of the fee, or as severance damages; provided,
however, that Lessee shall be entitled to any award for loss of or damage to
Lessee&#146;s trade fixtures and removable personal property.&#160; In the event that this Lease is not
terminated by reason of such condemnation.&#160;
Lessor shall, to the extent of severance damages received by Lessor in
connection with such condemnation, repair any damage to the Premises caused by
such condemnation except to the extent that Lessee has been reimbursed therefor
by the condemning authority.&#160; Lessee
shall pay any amount in excess of such severance damages required to complete
such repair.</p>

Objection, and within fifteen (15) days thereafter the two arbitrators shall

properties in San Mateo County.&#160; In the
event that the decision of the arbitrators has not, for any reason, been
rendered before the commencement of the extended term, that fact shall not
operate to effect or invalidate the exercise of the Option, but Lessee shall
continue to pay rent in the amount due under this Lease in the month preceding
the commencement of the extended term, subject to retroactive adjustment when
the new rental rate is determined.</p>
