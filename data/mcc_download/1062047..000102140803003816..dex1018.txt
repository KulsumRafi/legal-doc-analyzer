               AGREEMENT dated as of August 1, 2002 (this "Agreement"), among
               CONVERGYS CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation; the LENDERS party
               hereto; JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Administrative Agent; CITICORP
               USA, INC., PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, and BANK ONE, NA, as
               Co-Syndication Agents; and US BANK N.A. and THE ROYAL BANK OF
               SCOTLAND PLC, as Co-Documentation Agents.

          The Borrower (such term and each other capitalized term not otherwise
defined in this preamble having the meaning assigned in Article I below),
certain of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent are parties to the
Three-Year Credit Agreement dated as of November 19, 1999, as amended and
restated as of November 3, 2000, and as further amended as of November 16, 2001
(the "Existing Three-Year Credit Agreement"), and the 364-Day Credit Agreement
as amended and restated as of November 16, 2001 (the "Existing 364-Day Credit
Agreement" and, together with the Existing Three-Year Credit Agreement, the
"Existing Credit Agreements"). The Borrower has requested that the Existing
Credit Agreements be replaced with this Three-Year Competitive Advance and
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Borrower has requested the Lenders to
extend credit to enable it to borrow on a revolving credit basis on and after
the date hereof and at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date
a principal amount not in excess of $325,000,000 at any time outstanding. The
Borrower has also requested the Lenders to establish procedures pursuant to
which the Borrower may invite the Lenders to bid on an uncommitted basis on
short-term borrowings by the Borrower maturing on or prior to the Maturity Date.
The proceeds of borrowings hereunder are to be used for general corporate
purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements and the
payment of maturing commercial paper.

          The Lenders are willing to extend such credit to the Borrower on the
terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth.

          Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have
established a rating in Category 6; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to
have been established by S&P and Moody's for the Index Debt shall fall within
different Categories, then (A) if both such ratings are at or above Category 4,
the Applicable Rate shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless one
of the two ratings is two or more Categories lower than the other, in which case
the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the Category next above
that of the lower of the two ratings and (B) if one or both of such ratings is
below Category 4, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the
lower of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have
been established by S&P and Moody's for the Index Debt shall be changed (other

change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the
applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during
the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the
date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the
rating system of S&P or Moody's shall change, or if either such rating agency
shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the
Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition
to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such
rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the
Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in
effect prior to such change or cessation.

offices of such member in the United States; provided that if, as a result of
any change in any law, rule or regulation, it is no longer possible to determine

rate as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent to be representative of
the cost of such insurance to the Lenders.

          "Assignment and Assumption" means an assignment and assumption entered
into by a Lender and an assignee (with the consent of any party whose consent is
required by Section 9.04), and accepted by the Administrative Agent, in the form

          SECTION 2.01. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower from
time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount
that will not result in (a) such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding
such Lender's Commitment or (b) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures
plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans exceeding
the total Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Revolving Loans.

          SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be
made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. Each Competitive Loan
shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.04. The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the
Commitments and Competitive Bids of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall
be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.13, (i) each Revolving Borrowing shall be
comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request
in accordance herewith, and (ii) each Competitive Borrowing shall be comprised
entirely of Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans as the Borrower may request in
accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by
causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; provided further, that in exercising such option, each Lender shall
comply with its obligation under Section 2.18(a).

          (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that
each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.
Each Competitive Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. Borrowings of more than one
Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall
not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings
outstanding.

          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Maturity Date.

          SECTION 2.03. Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a
Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

     are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section
     2.06.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04. Competitive Bid Procedure. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, from time to time during the Availability Period
the Borrower may request Competitive Bids and may (but shall not have any
obligation to) accept Competitive Bids and borrow Competitive Loans; provided
that the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the total
Commitments. To request Competitive Bids, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone, in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, four Business Days
before the date of the proposed Borrowing and, in the case of a Fixed Rate

no more than one Competitive Bid Request on the same day and a Competitive Bid
Request shall not be made within five Business Days after the date of any
previous Competitive Bid Request, unless any and all such previous Competitive
Bid Requests shall have been withdrawn or all Competitive Bids received in
response thereto rejected. Each such telephonic Competitive Bid Request shall be
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
written Competitive Bid Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Competitive Bid
Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or a
     Fixed Rate Borrowing;

          (iv) the Interest Period to be applicable to such Borrowing, which
     shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest
     Period"; and

          (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds
     are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section
     2.06.

thereof by telecopy, inviting the Lenders to submit Competitive Bids.

          (b) Each Lender may (but shall not have any obligation to) make on
or more Competitive Bids to the Borrower in response to a Competitive Bid
Request. Each Competitive Bid by a Lender must be in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and must be received by the Administrative Agent by
telecopy, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 9:30
a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the proposed date of such
Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than
9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the proposed date of such Competitive
Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the form
approved by the Administrative Agent may be rejected by the Administrative
Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Lender as
promptly as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall specify (i) the principal
amount (which shall be a minimum of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive
Borrowing requested by the Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the
Lender is willing to make, (ii) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which the
Lender is prepared to make such Loan or Loans (expressed as a percentage rate
per annum in the form of a decimal to no more than four decimal places) and
(iii) the Interest Period applicable to each such Loan and the last day thereof.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower by
telecopy of the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount specified in each
Competitive Bid and the identity of the Lender that shall have made such
Competitive Bid.

          (d) Subject only to the provisions of this paragraph, the Borrower may
accept or reject any Competitive Bid. The Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed by telecopy in a form approved by
the Administrative Agent, whether and to what extent it has decided to accept or
reject each Competitive Bid, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing,
not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the
date of the proposed( Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate
Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the proposed date
of the Competitive Borrowing; provided that (i) the failure of the Borrower to
give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of each Competitive Bid, (ii)
the Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive
Bid Rate if the Borrower rejects a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive
Bid Rate, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the
Borrower shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the requested Competitive
Borrowing specified in the related Competitive Bid Request, (iv) to the extent
necessary to comply with clause (iii) above, the Borrower may accept Competitive
Bids at the same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which acceptance, in the case of
multiple Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata
in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid, and (v) except
pursuant to clause (iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a
Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount
of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided further that if a
Competitive Loan must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the
provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of
$1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata
allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a
particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be
rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the
Borrower. A notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph shall be
irrevocable.

          (e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender
by telecopy whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if so,
the amount and Competitive Bid Rate so accepted), and each successful bidder
will thereupon become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make
the Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.

          (f) If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive
Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly
to the Borrower at least one

<PAGE>

                                                                              17

quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the other Lenders are required
to submit their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section.

          SECTION 2.05. Increase in Commitments. (a) The Borrower may on one
occasion at any time not later than three months prior to the Maturity Date, by
written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy
to each of the Lenders), request that the total Commitments be increased by an
amount that will not result in the total commitments under this Agreement
exceeding $400,000,000 minus the amount of any reduction of the Commitments
pursuant to Section 2.08. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the
requested increase in the total Commitments and the date on which such increase
is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 30 days or more
than 60 days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Lender the
opportunity to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of the
proposed increased amount. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent given not more than 30 days after the date of the
Borrower's notice, either agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion
of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing being an "Increasing Lender") or
decline to increase its Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a
notice within such period of 30 days shall be deemed to have declined to
increase its Commitment) (each Lender so declining or deemed to have declined
being a "NonIncreasing Lender"). In the event that, on the 30th day after the
Borrower shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this
paragraph, the Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to
increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the
total Commitments requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent may
arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or
other financial institution referred to in this clause (a) being called an
"Augmenting Lender"), which may include any Lender, to extend Commitments or
increase their existing Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the
unsubscribed amount, provided that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a
Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the
Administrative Agent shall specify to evidence its Commitment and its status as
a Lender hereunder. Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this
clause (a) shall become effective on the date specified in the notice delivered
by the Borrower pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the total Commitments (or in the
Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this paragraph unless,
(i) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs
to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase) and the
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such
date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower, (ii) the
Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the
Lenders) documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under
clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of
the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase and (iii)
following any such increase pursuant to this Section, no Lender shall have a
Commitment representing more than 30% of the total Commitments.

          (b) On the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") of any
increase in the total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.05(a) (the "Commitment
Increase"), (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding (the
"Initial Loans") immediately prior to giving effect to the Commitment Increase
on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each Increasing
Lender and each Augmenting Lender that shall have been a Lender prior to the
Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an
amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lender's
Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment
Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings (as
hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lender's Applicable
Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans, (iii) each Augmenting Lender
that shall not have been a Lender prior

<PAGE>

                                                                              18

to the Commitment Increase shall pay to Administrative Agent in same day funds
an amount equal to the product of (1) such Augmenting Lender's Applicable
Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, and (iv) after the
Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii)
above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Non-Increasing Lender the
portion of such funds that is equal to the difference between (A) the product of
(1) such Non-Increasing Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated without
giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the
Initial Loans, and (B) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing Lender's
Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment
Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (v) after
the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have made new Borrowings (the "Subsequent Borrowings") in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans and of the
types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to
the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (vi) each
Non-Increasing Lender, each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall
be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing
(calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) and (vii) the
Borrower shall pay each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and
all accrued but unpaid interest on the Initial Loans. The deemed payments made
pursuant to clause (i) above in respect of each Eurodollar Loan shall be subject
to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if
the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest
Period relating thereto.

          SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account
of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available
to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to
an account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or
Competitive Bid Request.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial
Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower
may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may
elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate

<PAGE>

                                                                              19

Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not
be converted or continued.

          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
     if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
     thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing
     (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii)
     and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
     Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at
the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

          (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the
Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposure plus the

<PAGE>

                                                                              20

aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed the
total Commitments.

          (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at
least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly
following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant
to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of
the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case
such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.
Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

          SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan.

          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section;
provided that the Borrower shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive
Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.

          (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving

<PAGE>

                                                                              21

Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Revolving Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the
prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to
be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with
a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by
Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the
case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in
Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably
to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

          SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall
accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such
Lender (whether used or unused), or, after such Commitment shall have
terminated, the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lender, during the period
from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such
Commitment shall have terminated and such Lender shall have no outstanding
Revolving Loans. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of March, June, September and December of each year, on any date prior to
the Maturity Date on which the Commitments terminate and on the Maturity Date.
All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

          (b) For any day on which the outstanding principal amount of Loans
shall be greater than 50% of the total Commitments, the Borrower shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a utilization fee equal
to 0.125% per annum on the aggregate amount of each Lender's outstanding Loans
on such day. The utilization fees, if any, in respect of any fiscal quarter
shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and
December, on any date prior to the Maturity Date on which the Commitments
terminate and on the Maturity Date. All utilization fees shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

          (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in
the case of facility fees to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
(i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for
the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate, or
(ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, at the LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the
Margin applicable to such Loan.

          (c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Fixed Rate
applicable to such Loan.

<PAGE>

                                                                              22

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

          (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of
any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR
Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period
therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date
of such conversion.

          (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative
Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
     applicable, for such Interest Period; or

          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
     in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required
     to make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
     applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect
     the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans
     (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be
ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) any
request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be
ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by the Borrower for Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and
(B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of
Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

          SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

<PAGE>

                                                                              23

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

          (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans
     made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional
costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as
a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, such Lender to a level
below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's
policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. It is acknowledged
that this Agreement is being entered into by the Lenders on the understanding
that the Lenders will not be required to maintain capital against their
Commitments under currently applicable laws, regulations and regulatory
guidelines. In the event the Lenders shall otherwise determine that such
understanding is incorrect, it is agreed that the Lenders will be entitled to
make claims under this paragraph (b) based upon market requirements prevailing
on the date hereof for commitments under comparable credit facilities against
which capital is required to be maintained.

          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as
the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender
shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any
Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to such
compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the
Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

          SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the
last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an
Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow,
convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any
notice

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the failure
to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such
Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the
Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender
setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative
Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by

<PAGE>

                                                                              25

applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under
Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270
Park Avenue, New York, New York, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

          (b) (i) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (x) first,
towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (y) second, towards payment of principal then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal then due to such parties.

          (ii) For purposes of determining the available Commitments of the
Lenders at any time, each outstanding Competitive Borrowing shall be deemed to
have utilized the Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which
shall not have made Loans as part of such Competitive Borrowing) pro rata in
accordance with such respective Commitments.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee
or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the

<PAGE>

                                                                              26

account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on
such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.

          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may,
in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
(other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive
Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts)
and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

          The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

          SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

          SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are
within the Borrower's or Guarantor's, as the case may be, corporate powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower or the Guarantors, as applicable, and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or the Guarantors, as
applicable, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

          SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any
applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries.

          SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition: No Material Adverse Change. (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i) as of and for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP,
independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and
the portion of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, certified by its chief
financial officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods
in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

          (b) Since December 31, 2001, there has been no material adverse change
in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects in
title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

          (b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

          (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to
obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required
under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental
Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

          (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. The Borrower and
each Subsidiary is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is
continuing.

          SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined
in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

          SECTION 3.09. Taxes. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has timely filed
or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed
and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it,
except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has
set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP and (b) to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $20,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $25,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

          SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any
of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information
furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered
hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished)
contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, when taken as a whole, not misleading; provided
that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time.

          SECTION 3.12. Use of Proceeds. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business
of extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate,
of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X
of the Board) and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to buy or
carry any margin stock.

          SECTION 3.13. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.13 contains an accurate list of
all of the material Subsidiaries of the Borrower on the date hereof, setting
forth their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective ownership interest held by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries. All of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such material Subsidiaries
have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

     in Section 3.04 and, if any such change has occurred, specifying the effect
     of such change on the financial statements accompanying such certificate;

          (b) the filing or commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by or

     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

          (c) the occurrence of any ERISA Event that, alone or together with any
     other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to

     amount exceeding $20,000,000;

          (d) any change in the date of its fiscal year end; and

          (e) any other development that results in, or could reasonably be

will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all things
necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal

          SECTION 5.04. Payment of Obligations. The Borrower will, and will
cause each of the Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations, including Tax
liabilities, that, if not paid, could result in a Material Adverse Effect before
the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or
amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b)
the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves
with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment
pending such contest could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 5.05. Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. The Borrower will,
and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, (a) keep and maintain all property
material to the conduct of its business in good working order and condition,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and (b) maintain, with financially sound and
reputable insurance companies, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
as are customarily maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar
businesses operating in the same or similar locations.

          SECTION 5.06. Books and Records; Inspection Rights. The Borrower will,
and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and
account in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and
transactions in relation to its business and activities. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit
and inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and
records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers
and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as
reasonably requested.

acquisitions that are approved by the board of directors, or other governing
body, of the target entity before the acquiror commences a tender offer, proxy

of the Board, including Regulations U and X.

(a) direct Subsidiary not in existence (or not a direct Subsidiary) on the date

all of the obligations of a Guarantor under each such agreement.

          (c) any Lien existing on any property or asset prior to the
     acquisition thereof by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or existing on any
     property or asset of any Person that becomes a Subsidiary after the date
     hereof prior to the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary; provided that
     (i) such Lien is not created in contemplation of or in connection with such
     acquisition or such Person becoming a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii)

     purchasers under all Receivables Purchase Facilities that has not yet been
     recovered from collections on accounts receivables or otherwise paid by the
     Borrower and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
     outstanding under all Receivables Lending Facilities, shall not exceed

acquired, and thereafter rent or lease such property or other property which it
intends to use for substantially the same purpose or purposes as the property

exceed $25,000,000.

          SECTION 6.03. Fundamental Changes. (a) The Borrower will not, and will

transactions) all or substantially all of its assets, or all or substantially
all of the stock of any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, whether now owned or

          (b) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, engage to any material extent in any business other than businesses of the

other distributions with respect to any shares of its capital stock or to make

     the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice will be given at the
     request of any Lender);

          (f) the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall fail to make any payment
     (whether of principal or interest and regardless of amount) in respect of
     any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same shall become due and
     payable;

          (g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
     Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables
     or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
     both) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or
     agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material Indebtedness to become
     due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance
     thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity; provided that this clause (g)

          (i) the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall (i) voluntarily commence any

                                                                              38

          (1) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the
     Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have
     occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Effect;

          (m) the Guarantee Agreement or any provision thereof shall be declared
     to be unenforceable or null and void or any Guarantor or any person acting
     by or on behalf of such Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm any of such

          (n) a Change in Control shall occur;

          (o) there shall occur any event which constitutes a default, event of

     Purchase Facility in respect of which the aggregate amount of accounts
     receivable purchased net of the aggregate amount of accounts receivable
     collected exceeds $15,000,000 (a "Material Receivables Purchase Facility"),
     or the Borrower or any subsidiary shall fail to observe or perform any
     term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in any Material
     Receivables Purchase Facility, if, as a result of such event or failure,
     the purchasers thereunder or any agent acting on their behalf shall cause
     or be permitted to cause (any applicable grace or cure period having
     expired) such Material Receivables Purchase Facility or the commitments of
     the purchasers thereunder to terminate or cease to be fully available; or

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

          Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions
on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

<PAGE>

                                                                              39

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Co-Syndication Agent
shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether
a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under
the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own
gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed
not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender (in which case the
Administrative Agent shall deliver such written notice to the Lenders or the
other Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents
of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in
connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any
other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,
New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such

                                                                              40

successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative
Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

     It is agreed that the Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents
shall, in their capacities as such, have no duties or responsibilities under
this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  Miscellaneous

          SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and

by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

          (a) if to the Borrower, to it at Atrium One, 201 E. Fourth Street,
     102-1910, P.O. Box 1638, Cincinnati, Ohio 45201, Attention of William
     Coleman (Telecopy No. (513) 723-6556);

          (c) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number)
     set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

          SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

<PAGE>

                                                                              41

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder
and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan
shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

          (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant
to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the
Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i)
increase the Commitment of any Lender, including pursuant to Section 2.05,
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii)
postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or
any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of,
waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the Maturity Date or the scheduled
date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written
consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the
definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder or (vi)
release any Guarantor from its Guarantee obligations under the Guarantee
Agreement, or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee obligations,
without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and
their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel for the Agents, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents or any
Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
Agents or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its
rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans.

          (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
"Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any
other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the
proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless

of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to any Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent in its capacity as such.

          (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

          (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i)
the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b)(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below,
any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, a Balance Sheet CLO, an Approved Fund (as defined below)
or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee.

          (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

          (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of
a Lender, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not
be less than $10,000,000 or, if smaller, the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
shall otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

          (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not apply to rights in respect
of outstanding Competitive Loans.

                                                                              43

          (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500;

          (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and

          (E) in the case of an assignment to a Balance Sheet CLO (as defined
below), the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, except
that the Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such Balance Sheet
CLO may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such Balance
Sheet CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first
proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Balance Sheet CLO.

          For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms "Approved Fund"
and "Balance Sheet CLO" have the following meanings:

          "Approved Fund" means, with respect to any Lender that is a fund which
invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any other fund that
invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is managed by the
same investment advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment
advisor.

          "Balance Sheet CLO" means, with respect to any Lender, any Person
(other than a natural person) that is (i) established for the purpose of making,
purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in bank loans and similar extensions
of credit in order to allow such Lender to manage its balance sheet or
regulatory or the ordinary course of its business and its economic capital and
(ii) administered or managed by such Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender

          (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section.

          (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and

<PAGE>

                                                                              44

Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (c)(i) Any Lender may, without notice to or the consent of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks
or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

          (d) Any Lender, without notice to or the consent of any Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          (e) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that
its Commitments and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without
giving effect to assignments thereof that have not become effective, are as set
forth in such Assignment and Assumption; (ii) except as set forth in clause (i)
above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of any of the foregoing, or the financial condition of the Borrower or the
performance or observance by the Borrower of any of their obligations under this
Agreement or under any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (iii) each of the assignee and the
assignor represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment and Assumption; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

Agreement, together with copies of any amendments or consents entered into prior
to the date of such Assignment and Assumption and copies of the most recent
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (v) such assignee will
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning
Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agents on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated to it by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations that by
the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

          SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower or the Guarantors in the Loan Documents and in
the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under any Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
the repayment of the Loans or the termination of the Commitments or of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

          SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration, Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any

<PAGE>

                                                                              46

demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction, Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

          (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or any other Loan Document or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

          (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any
court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

          (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders agrees to maintain
the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of
the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the
Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified
at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

          SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
