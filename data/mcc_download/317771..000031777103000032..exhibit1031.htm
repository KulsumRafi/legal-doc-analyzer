income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and
state and local income taxes at the Executive&#146;s highest marginal rate of taxation in the

amount of such repayment from the date the Gross-Up Payment was initially made to the
date of repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code (the
&#147;Applicable Rate&#148;). In the event that the Excise Tax is determined by the Internal
Revenue Service or by such independent public accountants to exceed the amount taken
into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of
which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall

penalties, fines or additions to tax payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the
amount of such excess if finally determined. Any payment to be made under this
paragraph shall be payable within five (5) days of the determination of the accountants
that such a payment is required hereunder and, if applicable, within five (5) days of such
determination that the Excise Tax is greater or less than initially calculated but, in no
event, later than thirty (30) days after the Executive&#146;s receipt of the Payments resulting in
such Excise Tax.</p></dir>
