    Mr. Forster is retiring as an employee of the Companies effective as of the

    the Chief Executive Officer of DPL. </font> </p>
  <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.
    As the Companies confront the dramatic and rapid changes currently affecting
    the electric and gas utility industry generally and the challenges and uncertainties
    associated therewith, the Board of Directors of each of the Companies desires
    to secure the continued services of Mr. Forster to assure the continued benefit
    of his leadership, experience, wisdom, expertise and insight. Accordingly,
    the Board of Directors of each of the Companies desires that Mr. Forster remain
    as the Chairman of the Board of each of the Companies and as the Chairman
    of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of DPL and further desires
    to retain Mr. Forster as a consultant to the Companies. </font> </p>
  <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.
    Mr. Forster is willing to remain, in a non-employee capacity, as the Chairman
    of the Board of each of the Companies and as the Chairman of the Executive
    Committee of the Board of Directors of DPL and to act as a consultant to the

  17. Gross-Up Payment.</u></b> In the event that any payments under this Agreement
  or any other agreement will be subject to the tax (the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;)
  imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Code&#148;)
  or any successor or similar provision, the Companies shall pay Mr. Forster an

  retained by Mr. Forster after deduction of any Excise Tax on such payments (excluding
  payments pursuant to this Section 17), and after deduction for any federal,
  state and local income tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this
  Section 17, shall be equal to the amount of such payments (excluding payments
  pursuant to this Section 17) before payment of any Excise Tax (hereinafter the
  &#147;Excise Tax Compensation Net Payment&#148;). For purposes of determining
  whether any of such payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount
  of such Excise Tax, any payments or benefits received or to be received by Mr.
  Forster in connection with a Change of Control or the termination of this Agreement
  shall be treated as &#147;parachute payments&#148; within the meaning of Section
  280G of the Code, and all &#147;excess parachute payments&#148; within the meaning
  of Section 280G of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless
  in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the independent auditors of the Companies
  and acceptable to Mr. Forster such payments or benefits do not constitute parachute
  payments or excess parachute payments. For purposes of determining the amount
  of the Gross-Up Payment, Mr. Forster shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes
  at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year
  in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes
  at the highest marginal rates of taxation in the state and locality of his residence
  on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
  which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the
  event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount
  taken into account hereunder at the Date of Termination, Mr. Forster shall repay
  to the Companies, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax
  is finally determined, an amount necessary so that the total payments hereunder
  equal the Excise Tax Compensation Net Payment, plus interest on the amount of
  such repayment at a rate equivalent to the rate described in Section 280G(d)(4)
  of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount
  taken into account hereunder at the Date of Termination, the Companies shall
  make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest
  payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess
  is finally determined. The Gross-Up Payment shall be paid not later than the
  fifteenth day after the Date of Termination. </font> </P>
