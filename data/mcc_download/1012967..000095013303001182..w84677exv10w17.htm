</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and the Partnership desire to employ the Executive in the

this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that such term shall automatically be extended

involve any material conflict of interest with the interests of the Company or,
individually or collectively, interfere materially with the performance by the
Executive of his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as expressly provided herein, during
the Term, the Executive may not accept employment with any other individual or
entity, or engage in any other venture which is directly or indirectly in
conflict or competition with the business of the Company or the Partnership.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Executive&#146;s office and place of rendering his services under this
Agreement shall be in the principal executive offices of the Company which
shall be in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Under no circumstances
shall the Executive be required to relocate from the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area or provide services under this Agreement in any other

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;During the Term, the Company and the Partnership will pay the
Executive a base salary at an aggregate annual rate of not less than $325,000
per annum, subject to annual review by the Compensation Committee of the Board
(the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;), and in the discretion of such Committee,
increased from time to time. Such salary shall be paid in periodic
installments in accordance with the Company&#146;s standard practice, but not less
frequently than semi-monthly. The first annual review for which Executive
shall be eligible for a raise shall be on or about April&nbsp;1, 2003.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;For each fiscal year during the Term, the Executive will be eligible
to receive a bonus from the Company. The award and amount of such bonus shall
be based upon the achievement of predefined operating or performance goals and
other criteria established by the Compensation Committee, which goals shall
give the Executive the opportunity to earn a bonus in the following amounts:
threshold target &#151; 25% of base salary; internal plan: 60% of base salary;
target &#151; 100% of base salary; and maximum bonus amount &#151; 125% of base salary.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Company shall also pay Executive for his 2002 pro-rated
anticipated bonus from his previous employer, to the extent such bonus is not
paid by Executive&#146;s previous employer. Such anticipated bonus equals $175,000,
and shall be paid, to the extent not paid by Executive&#146;s previous employer, in
two thirds (2/3) cash and one-third (1/3) restricted stock. To the extent such
bonus is not paid by Executive&#146;s previous employer, such cash payment and such
restricted stock payment shall be paid after a determination of the Executive&#146;s
final bonus amount, but in any event, no later March&nbsp;31, 2003.

senior executive officers.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;On December&nbsp;13, 2002, the Executive shall be granted 50,000 shares of
restricted stock and 100,000 stock options in the Company. Such restricted
stock shall not vest until June&nbsp;13, 2003. If the Executive terminates this
Agreement without Good Reason, or if the Company terminates the Agreement for
Cause prior to June&nbsp;13, 2003, then Executive forfeits all shares in such
restricted stock. With respect to the 100,000 stock options grant, such
options shall vest over three (3)&nbsp;years, pursuant to the Company&#146;s Incentive
Plan and in accordance with the terms thereof. At the Board&#146;s sole discretion,
Executive shall also be eligible for stock option grants from time to time
(currently anticipated to be considered during May of each year) pursuant to
the Company&#146;s Incentive Plan and in accordance with the terms thereof. In
addition, Executive shall be eligible for annual restricted stock grants
ranging from a minimum of 15,000 shares to a maximum of 40,000 shares, as
determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, and such restricted stock
grants shall vest equally over three years, and in accordance with the terms of
the Company&#146;s standard form of restricted stock agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;The Company and the Partnership will reimburse the Executive, in
accordance with their standard policies from time to time in effect, for all
out-of-pocket business expenses as may be incurred by the Executive in the
performance of his duties under this Agreement.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;The Executive shall be entitled to vacation time to be credited and
taken in accordance with the Company&#146;s policy from time to time in effect for
senior executives, which in any event shall not be less than a total of four
weeks per calendar year. Such vacation time shall not be carried over year to
year, and shall not be paid out upon termination of employment, or upon
expiration of this Agreement.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Executive shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Company and the Partnership against any
and all judgments, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and other
reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees
and disbursements) actually incurred by the Executive in connection with any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other) for any action or omission in
his capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or the
Partnership.

an action, suit or proceeding for which he claims the right to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3(h) shall be paid by the Company or the Partnership,

<P><FONT size="2">final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon the Company&#146;s or
the Partnership&#146;s receipt of (x)&nbsp;a written affirmation by the Executive of his
good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for his
indemnification hereunder and under the provisions of applicable law has been
met and (y)&nbsp;a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Executive to repay the
amount advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a court that the
Executive engaged in conduct which precludes indemnification under the
provisions of such applicable law. Such written undertaking in clause (y)
shall be accepted by the Company or the Partnership, as the case may be,
without security therefor and without reference to the financial ability of the
Executive to make repayment thereunder. The Company and the Partnership shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect for the Term of this
Agreement a directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policy, with a policy
limit of at least $5,000,000, subject to customary exclusions, with respect to
claims made against officers and directors of the Company or the Partnership;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U> , the Company or the Partnership, as the case
may be, shall be relieved of this obligation to maintain directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance if, in the good faith judgment of the Company or
the Partnership, it cannot be obtained at a reasonable cost.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination</U>.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Term will terminate immediately upon the Executive&#146;s death or,
upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice by the Company, in the case of a
determination of the Executive&#146;s Disability. As used herein the term
&#147;Disability&#148; means the Executive&#146;s inability to perform his duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement for a period of more than 120 consecutive
days, or for more than 180&nbsp;days, whether or not continuous, during any 365-day
period, due to physical or mental incapacity or impairment. A determination of
Disability will be made by a physician reasonably satisfactory to both the
Executive and the Company and paid for by the Company or the Partnership whose
decision shall be final and binding on the Executive and the Company;
<U>provided</U> that if they cannot agree as to a physician, then each shall
select and pay for a physician and these two together shall select a third
physician whose fee shall be borne equally by the Executive and either the
Company or the Partnership and whose determination of Disability shall be
binding on the Executive and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Executive shall not be considered &#147;Disabled&#148; unless he qualifies for disability
benefits under the terms and conditions of the Company&#146;s then existing
long-term disability plan. Should the Executive become incapacitated, his
employment shall continue and all base and other compensation due the Executive
hereunder shall continue to be paid through the date upon which the Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated for Disability in accordance with this section.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Term may be terminated by the Company upon notice to the Executive
upon the occurrence of any event constituting &#147;Cause&#148; as defined herein.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Term may be terminated by the Executive upon notice to the Company
