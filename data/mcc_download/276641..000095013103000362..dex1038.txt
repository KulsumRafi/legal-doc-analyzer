                       COVENANTS OF RPA SELLER AND BUYER

          Section 5.1. RPA Seller Covenants. RPA Seller hereby covenants and
                       --------------------
     agrees with Buyer as follows:

          (a) Cardholder Agreements and Cardholder Guidelines. RPA Seller shall
              -----------------------------------------------
     comply with and perform its obligations under the Cardholder Agreements
     relating

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

     to the Accounts and the Cardholder Guidelines, except insofar as any
     failure to so comply or conform would not materially and adversely affect
     the rights of the Receivables Trust, the Receivables Trustee and
     Securityholders under the Transaction Documents. In that regard, except as
     aforesaid, and so long as such changes are made applicable to the
     comparable segments of those MasterCard and VISA accounts owned and
     serviced by RPA Seller which have characteristics the same as, or
     substantially similar to, the Accounts pursuant to which the Receivables
     were created (if any), RPA Seller shall be free to change the terms and
     provisions of such Cardholder Agreements or the Cardholder Guidelines in
     any respect (including the calculation of the amount, the timing, of
     charge-offs). RPA Seller shall provide to each Rating Agency written notice
     of any such change that (1) lowers the periodic finance charge rate used to
     calculate Finance Charges on any Account or changes the minimum monthly
     payment applicable to any Account; (2) changes any periodic finance charge
     rate used to calculate Finance Charges on any Account from a floating rate
     to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a floating rate; (3) reduces any
     Cardholder Fees, Cash Advance Fees or other fees applicable to any Account
     or (4) changes the calculation of the amount, or the timing, of charge
     offs.

          (b) Finance Charges and Other Fees. Except (i) as otherwise required
              ------------------------------
     by any Requirements of Law or (ii) as is consistent with the provisions of
     the Servicing Agreement and all Supplements thereto and as is deemed by RPA
     Seller to be advisable for its MasterCard and VISA program based on a good
     faith assessment by RPA Seller of the various factors impacting the use of
     its MasterCard and VISA cards, RPA Seller shall not reduce at any time (x)
     the Finance Charges assessed in respect of any Accounts or (y) any other
     fees charged on any of the Accounts, if as a result of any such reduction,
     RPA Seller's reasonable expectation of the Portfolio Yield in respect of
     any Series as of such date would be less than the current Base Rate
     applicable to such Series.

          (c) Receivables Not to be Evidenced by Promissory Securities. RPA
              --------------------------------------------------------
     Seller will take no action to cause any Receivable to be evidenced by any
     instrument.

          (d) Security Interests. Except for the conveyances hereunder, (i) RPA
              ------------------
     Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or
     grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any Receivable,
     whether now existing or hereafter created, or any interest therein; (ii)
     RPA Seller will immediately notify Buyer and the Receivables Trustee of the
     existence of any Lien on any Receivable; and (iii) RPA Seller shall defend
     the right, title, and interest of Buyer and its successors and assigns in,
     to, and under the Receivables, whether now existing or hereafter created,
     against all claims of third parties claiming through or under RPA Seller;
     provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.1(d) shall prevent or be
     --------  -------                       --------------
     deemed to prohibit RPA Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the
     Accounts or Receivables any Liens for state, municipal or other local taxes
     if such taxes shall not at the time be due and payable or if RPA Seller
     shall concurrently be contesting the

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

     validity thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have
     set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

          (e) Chief Executive Office; State of Organization. RPA Seller's chief
              ---------------------------------------------
     executive office and state of organization are identified on Schedule Two.
                                                                  ------------
     RPA Seller will not relocate its chief executive office or state of
     organization, unless RPA Seller shall have given to Buyer not less than 15
     days' written notice of its intention to do so, clearly describing the new
     location or state of organization. If as a result of such relocation, the
     applicable provisions of the UCC or any other applicable law require the
     filing of any amendment to any previously-filed financing or continuation
     statement or the filing of a new financing statement, RPA Seller shall file
     such financing statement or amendment as may be necessary with respect to
     the transfer of accounts. Additionally, RPA Seller shall clearly and
     unambiguously identify or cause to be identified each Account (including
     any Additional Account designated pursuant to Section 2.2) in its computer
                                                   -----------
     records relating to the Receivables, to reflect that the Receivables
     arising in such Account have been sold to Buyer and transferred by Buyer to
     the Receivables Trust pursuant to the Servicing Agreement. RPA Seller
     shall, prior to the sale or transfer to a third party of any receivable
     owned by RPA Seller or held in its custody, examine its books and records,
     including any computer records, to determine that such receivable is not a
     Receivable.

          (f) Change of Name or Corporate Structure. Within 30 days after RPA
              -------------------------------------
     Seller makes any change in its name, identity, or corporate structure which
     would make any financing statement or continuation statement filed in
     accordance with Section 2.1 above seriously misleading within the meaning
                     -----------
     of Section 9-508 of the UCC as in effect in the state where such financing
     statement or continuation statement was filed, RPA Seller shall file such
     financing statements or amendments as may be necessary to perfect or
     maintain the perfection of the transfer of the Receivables.

          (g) Further Assurances. RPA Seller will make, execute or endorse,
              ------------------
     acknowledge, and file or deliver to Buyer from time to time such schedules,
     confirmatory assignments, conveyances, transfer endorsements, powers of
     attorney, certificates, reports and other assurances or instruments and
     take such further steps relating to the Receivables and other rights
     covered by this Agreement, as Buyer may request and reasonably require.

          (h) Indemnification. RPA Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
              ---------------
     Buyer harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, damage,
     judgment, claim, deficiency, or expense (including interest, penalties,
     reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement) to which Buyer
     may become subject insofar as such loss, liability, damage, judgment,
     claim, deficiency, or expense arises out of or is based upon (i) a breach
     by RPA Seller of its warranties and covenants contained in Section 4.1
                                                                -----------
     (provided, however, with respect to the representations and warranties
      --------  -------

     obligations of RPA Seller under this Section 5.1(h) shall be considered to

              -------------------------

     the date which is one year and one day after the Scheduled Trust
     Termination Date, it will not institute against, or join any other person
     in instituting against, Buyer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
     insolvency or liquidation proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy
     or similar law.

          (l) Merger; Consolidation. RPA Seller shall not consolidate with or
              ---------------------
     merge into any other Person or convey or transfer its properties and assets
     substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

               (i) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which RPA
          Seller is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or
          transfer the properties and assets of RPA Seller substantially as an
          entirety shall be, if RPA Seller is not the surviving entity,

          covenant and obligation of RPA Seller, as applicable hereunder, and
          shall benefit from all the rights granted to RPA Seller, as applicable
          hereunder. To the extent that any right, covenant or obligation of RPA
          Seller, as applicable hereunder, is inapplicable to the successor
          entity, such successor entity shall be subject to

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

          such covenant or obligation, or benefit from such right, as would
          apply to the extent practicable, to such successor entity;

               (ii) RPA Seller shall have delivered to the Buyer an Officer's

          with this Agreement and that all conditions precedent herein provided
          for relating to such transaction have been complied with and, in the

          (n) Account Allocations.

          Receivables, whenever created, with respect to Principal Receivables
          which have been transferred to Buyer shall continue to be property of
          Buyer or its assigns notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer of
          additional Principal Receivables to Buyer and Collections with respect
          thereto shall continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with the

          giving rise to such Receivable first to the total amount of Principal
          Receivables of the appropriate Obligor retained by

                                      -18-

              ------------------
     deposit to the Excess Funding Account on account of a Credit Adjustment,

              ---------------
     promptly pay Buyer amounts necessary for Buyer to make its payment
     obligations in time pursuant to Article VII of the Trust Agreement.

     except (i) as is required in connection with the performance of the
     Receivables Trustee's duties under the Servicing Agreement or in enforcing
     the rights of the Securityholders and (ii) such disclosures as are required
     upon appointment of a successor Servicer under the Servicing Agreement.

     measures as shall be reasonably requested by RPA Seller to protect and
     maintain the security and confidentiality of such information, and in
     connection therewith, shall allow RPA Seller to inspect the applicable
     security and confidentiality arrangements from time to time in normal
     business hours. Buyer shall (and shall cause the Receivables Trustee to)
     give RPA Seller five days prior written notice of any disclosure pursuant

                             REPURCHASE OBLIGATION

          Section 6.1. Mandatory Repurchase. (a) In the event of a breach of any
                       --------------------
     representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.1(l) before the FCMT
                                              --------------
     Termination Date RPA Seller shall accept a retransfer of each Principal
     Receivable to which such breach relates (an "Ineligible Receivable") on the
                                                  ---------------------
     date on which such Ineligible Receivable is retransferred to Buyer under
     Section 2.4(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement on the terms and
     --------------
     conditions set forth below. In the event that the exclusion of an
     Ineligible Receivable from the calculation of the Seller Amount would cause
     the Seller Amount to be less than the Minimum Seller Amount, RPA Seller
     shall pay Buyer a sufficient amount in immediately available funds in time
     to enable Buyer to make a deposit in the Collection Account in an amount
     equal to the Shortfall Amount as required under Section 2.4(d) of the
                                                     --------------
     Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Upon each retransfer to RPA Seller of such
     Ineligible Receivable, the Buyer shall automatically and without further
     action be deemed to transfer, assign and set-over to RPA Seller, without
     recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of
     the Buyer in, to and under such Ineligible Receivable, all monies due or to
     become due with respect thereto, all proceeds thereof and Insurance
     Proceeds relating thereto. The Buyer shall execute such documents and
     instruments of transfer and take such other actions as shall reasonably be
     requested by RPA Seller to effect the transfer of such Ineligible
     Receivable pursuant to this subsection. The obligation of RPA Seller to
     accept retransfer of any Ineligible Receivable shall constitute the sole
     remedy respecting any breach of the representations and warranties set
     forth in Section 4.1(l)) with respect to such Receivable available to the
              ---------------
     Buyer, Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders
     (as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement).

     forth in Section 4.1(l) on and after the FCMT Termination Date, then RPA
              --------------
     Seller shall accept reassignment of all Receivables in the related Account
     ("Ineligible Receivables") on the terms and conditions set forth in this
       ----------------------
     paragraph on the date on which such Ineligible Receivables are reassigned
     to Buyer under Section 2.4(d) of the Transfer and Servicing Agreement. If
                    --------------
     the exclusion of an Ineligible Receivable from the calculation of the
     Seller Amount would cause the Seller Amount to be less than the Minimum
     Seller Amount, then RPA Seller shall pay Buyer a sufficient amount in
     immediately available funds in time to enable Buyer, on the date of
     retransfer of such Ineligible Receivable, to make a deposit in the
     Collection Account in an amount equal to the Shortfall Amount as required
     under Section 2.4(d) of the Transfer and Servicing Agreement. The amounts

                     ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
                                 AND COVENANTS

          In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained
in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, RPA Seller hereby represents, warrants
and covenants to Buyer as follows:

     (1) The Receivables Purchase Agreement creates a valid transfer to Buyer of
all right, title and interest of RPA Seller in, to and under the Receivables
conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, and such
property will be held by Buyer free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens
permitted pursuant to paragraph (2) below.
                      -------------

     (2) Immediately prior to the conveyance of the Receivables pursuant to the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, RPA Seller owns and has good and marketable
title to the Receivables free and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of any
Person; provided that nothing in this paragraph (2) shall prevent or be deemed
        --------                      -------------
to prohibit RPA Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the Receivables any
Liens for any taxes if such taxes shall not at the time be due and payable or if
RPA Seller shall currently be contesting the validity thereof in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves
with respect thereto.

             PROVISIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN OPINION OF COUNSEL TO BE
                 DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION 2.2(b) OF THE
                         RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
                         ------------------------------

     The opinions set forth below may be subject to certain qualifications,
assumptions, limitations and exceptions taken or made in the opinion of RPA
Seller's counsel with respect to similar matters delivered on the RPA Closing
Date.

     1. The Supplemental Conveyance has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by RPA Seller and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement
of RPA Seller, enforceable against RPA Seller in accordance with its terms.

     2. We have opined in a letter of even date that the Supplemental Conveyance
constitutes a valid assignment of the RPA Seller's right, title and interest in,
to and under the Receivables in the Additional Accounts and the related
Transferred Assets. [Such opinion letter shall be substantially similar to the
similar letter delivered on the RPA Closing Date.] Financing Statements having
been filed in the office of the Secretary of State of Oregon, and in Washington,
D.C., Buyer has acquired (based upon certificates of RPA Seller to the effect
that RPA Seller has not transferred any interest in the Receivables other than
to the Trustee or caused any lien to be imposed upon the Receivables) all
rights, title and interest of the RPA Seller in the Transferred Assets free and
clear of any Lien or interest of any Person except for Liens permitted under
subsection 5.1(d) of the Receivables Purchase Agreement.

     3. No filings or other action, other than the filing of the financing
statement(s) referred to in such opinion (the "Financing Statements") with
respect to the Buyer's security interest in such Transferred Assets, in the
office of the Secretary of State of Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., are
necessary to perfect or continue the perfected status of the security or other
interest of the Buyer in the Transferred Assets designated by the Supplemental
Conveyance, and the proceeds thereof, against third parties, except that
appropriate continuation statements with respect to the Financing Statements be
filed at five-year intervals to continue the perfection of such security
interest.

     4. The transfer of the Receivables in the Additional Accounts to the Buyer
would not constitute a fraudulent conveyance of RPA Seller; provided, that this
opinion numbered 4 need not be delivered if the short-term unsecured debt
obligations of RPA Seller are rated at the time of such transfer at least P-3 by
Moody's.
