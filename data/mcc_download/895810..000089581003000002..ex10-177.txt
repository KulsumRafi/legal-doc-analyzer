                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

         2.01 Committed Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Committed
Loan") to the  Borrower  from  time to time,  on any  Business  Day  during  the
Availability  Period,  in  an  aggregate  amount  not  to  exceed  at  any  time
outstanding  the amount of such Lender's  Commitment;  provided,  however,  that
after giving effect to any Committed Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall
not exceed the Aggregate Commitments,  and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount
of the Committed  Loans of any Lender,  plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,  plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the  Outstanding  Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such  Lender's
Commitment.  Within the limits of each Lender's  Commitment,  and subject to the
other terms and  conditions  hereof,  the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Committed
Loans may be Base Rate Loans or  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans,  as  further  provided
herein.
<PAGE>
         2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed Loans.

         (a)  Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from
one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which
may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three (3) Business Days prior
to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate
Committed Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate
Committed Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a
written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as
provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to
Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice
(whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is
requesting a Committed Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans from one Type
to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested
date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which
shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Committed Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be
borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, and (v) if
applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the
Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or
if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or
continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted
to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be
effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect
to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing
of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such
Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be
deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

         (b)  Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of
the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or
continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans
described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Committed Borrowing,
each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to the
Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 12:00 noon. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit
Extension, Section 5.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of
such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided,
however, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such
Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full
of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, to the Borrower as provided above.
<PAGE>
         (c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders.

         (d)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination  of the  Eurodollar  Rate by the  Administrative  Agent  shall  be
conclusive  in the absence of manifest  error.  At any time that Base Rate Loans
are  outstanding,  the  Administrative  Agent shall  notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of any change in Bank of America's  prime rate used in  determining  the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

         (e)  After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions
of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of
Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than six (6) Interest
Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans.

         2.03 Letters of Credit.

         (a)  The Letter of Credit Commitment.

              (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A)
         the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other
         Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any
         Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter
         of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account
         of the Borrower, and to amend Letters of Credit previously issued by
         it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts
         under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to
         participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the
         Borrower; provided that the L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to make
         any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and no
         Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as
         of the date of such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Total Outstandings
         would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding
         Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro
         Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line
         Loans would exceed such Lender's Commitment, or (z) the Outstanding
         Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter of Credit
         Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit
         shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the
         foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit
         that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
<PAGE>
              (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any
         Letter of Credit if:

                   (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
              Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
              restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
              Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive
              (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
              Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or
              request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters
              of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or
              shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of
              Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which
              the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in
              effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer
              any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on
              the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems
              material to it;

                   (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
              occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance, unless
              the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                   (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
              occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the
              Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                   (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one
              or more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

                   (E) such Letter of Credit is in an initial amount less than
              $100,000, in the case of a standby Letter of Credit, or is to be
              denominated in a currency other than Dollars.

              (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
         Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such
         time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
         hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept
         the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
<PAGE>
         (b)  Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit.

              (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the
         case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
         Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a
         Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a
         Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application
         must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not
         later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date
         and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its
         sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
         amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial
         issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
         specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the
         proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall
         be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date
         thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the
         documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
         thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by
         such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other
         matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an
         amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
         Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C
         Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of
         amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of
         the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer
         may require.

              (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application,
         the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone
         or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of
         such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the
         L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.
         Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative
         Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in
         accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a
         Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the
         applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance
         with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business practices.
         Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender
         shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
         to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of
         Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata
         Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

              (iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
         any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver
         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
<PAGE>
         (c)  Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

              (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit
         of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer
         shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not
         later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer
         under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the
         Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative
         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower
         fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative
         Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount
         of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount
         of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower
         shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate
         Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the
         Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples
         specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans,
         but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate
         Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than
         the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C
         Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i)
         may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided
         that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
         conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

              (ii) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer)
         shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds
         available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
         at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata
         Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
         Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
         whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each
         Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a
         Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
         Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C
         Issuer.

              (iii)With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
         fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because
         the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any
         other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the
         L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount
         that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable
         on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the
         Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
         Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its
         participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance
         from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under
         this Section 2.03.

              (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance
         pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any
         amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account
         of the L/C Issuer.
<PAGE>
              (v)  Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C
         Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of
         Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including
         (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which
         such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other
         Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of
         a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each
         Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section
         2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other
         than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such
         making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount
         of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit,
         together with interest as provided herein.

              (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
         Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid
         by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C
         Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through
         the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon
         for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on
         which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate
         per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.
         A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
         clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d)  Repayment of Participations.

              (i)  At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under
         any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C
         Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c),
         if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer
         any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest
         thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including
         proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative
         Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro
         Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
         payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C
         Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the
         Administrative Agent.

                  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for
         the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is
         required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
         Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
         L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata
         Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest
         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
         returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect.
<PAGE>
         (e)  Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each
L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

              (i)  any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of
         Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating
         thereto;

              (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off,
         defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against
         any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any
         Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
         acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
         this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter
         of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any
         unrelated transaction;

              (iii)any draft, demand, certificate or other document
         presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit;

              (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
         comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by
         the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to
         be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the
         benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of
         or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of
         Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under
         any Debtor Relief Law; or

              (v)  any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
         that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
         of, the Borrower.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
<PAGE>
         (f)  Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates
and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of
the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer,
any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants
or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action
taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of
the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the
due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The
Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however,
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any
Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or
assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the
matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided,
however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be
liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which
the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross
negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g)  Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i)
if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if,
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any
reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the
date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case
may be). For purposes hereof, "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit
with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer
and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account
balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to
by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The
Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts
and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral
shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of
America.
<PAGE>
         (h)  Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed
by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the
rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute
of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be
in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit,
and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,
as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC")
at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission
on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

         (i)  Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative  Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance  with its Pro
Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the
Applicable  Margin for Eurodollar  Rate Loans times the aggregate  stated amount
for each  Letter of Credit.  Such  letter of credit  fees shall be computed on a
quarterly basis in arrears.  Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable
on the last Business Day of each April, July, October,  and January,  commencing
with the first such date to occur  after the  issuance of such Letter of Credit,
on the Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date and thereafter on demand.  If there is
any change in the Applicable Margin during any quarter, the daily maximum amount
of each  standby  Letter of  Credit  shall be  computed  and  multiplied  by the
Applicable  Margin  separately  for each period  during such  quarter  that such
Applicable Margin was in effect.

         (j)  Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a
fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in the amounts and at the
times specified in the Fee Letter. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly
to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation,
amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of
the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.
Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand
and are nonrefundable.

         (k)  Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

         2.04 Swing Line Loans.

         (a)  The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing
Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
Committed Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender,
may exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after
giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not
exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds
of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and
reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate
Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be
deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from
the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount
equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such
Swing Line Loan.
<PAGE>
         (b)  Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon
the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested
borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must
be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after
receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the
Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan
Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent
(by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line
Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative
Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of
the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to
make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the
applicable conditions specified in Article V is not then satisfied, then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not
later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan
Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower.

         (c)  Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

              (i)  The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute
         discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
         irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its
         behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Committed Loan in an amount
         equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans
         then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written
         request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes
         hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02,
         without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the
         principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized
         portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in
         Section 5.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a
         copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering
         such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an
         amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such
         Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in
         immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
         the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day
         specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section
         2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed
         to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount.
         The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing
         Line Lender.
<PAGE>
              (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by
         such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the
         request for Base Rate Committed Loans submitted by the Swing Line
         Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing
         Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the
         relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender
         pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of
         such participation.

              (iii)If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
         Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to
         be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing
         Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
         date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line
         Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
         time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any
         Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts
         owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest
         error.

         (iv) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or to purchase
         and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this
         Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
         affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim,
         recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against
         the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
         whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any
         other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of
         the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make
         Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.02. No such funding of risk
         participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the
         Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided
         herein.

         (d) Repayment of Participations.

              (i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk
         participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives
         any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender
         will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment
         (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect
         the period of time during which such Lender's risk participation was
         funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
<PAGE>
              (ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect
         of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be
         returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances
         described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
         entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender
         shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand
         of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
         such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make
         such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.

         (e)  Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender
shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line
Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk
participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall
be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

         (f)  Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make
all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

         2.05 Prepayments.

         (a)  Voluntary Prepayments.

              (i)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent,
         at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in
         whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such
         notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (A) not later than
         11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of
         Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
         Business Day of any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any
         prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
         $1,000,000 or a greater integral multiple thereof; and (iii) any
         prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount
         of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in
         each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
         outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
         prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid. The
         Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of
         each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
         such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower
         shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such
         notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any
         prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all
         accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional
         amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall
         be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with
         their respective Pro Rata Shares.
<PAGE>
              (ii) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender
         (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to
         time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without
         premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by
         the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00
         p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall
         be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000. Each such notice shall
         specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given
         by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the
         payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
         date specified therein.

              (iii)If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time
         exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall
         immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations
         in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that
         the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C
         Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(a)(iii) unless after the
         prepayment in full of the Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans the
         Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

              (i)  Asset Sales. Immediately upon the receipt of the proceeds
         thereof, Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to the net
         cash proceeds of any sale, liquidation or disposition of any assets of
         any Company (other than the Partnerships or the assets of the
         Partnerships), where such net cash proceeds exceed $100,000.

              (ii) Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock or Debt. Immediately
         upon the receipt of the proceeds thereof, except for proceeds of Debt
         permitted by 8.03(a), (b), (c), or (d), Borrower shall prepay the Loans
         in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of any Issuance
         Proceeds.

              (iii)Application of Mandatory Prepayments. Any such mandatory
         prepayments of Loans shall be applied to the Notes on a pro rata basis
         based upon the outstanding principal balances of such Notes as of the
         date of payment. Any such prepayments shall not reduce the Aggregate
         Commitments.

         2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from
time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any
such notice shall be received by the  Administrative  Agent not later than 11:00
a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any
such partial  reduction  shall be in an aggregate  amount of  $1,000,000  or any
greater  integral  multiple  thereof,  (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or
reduce the  Aggregate  Commitments  if, after giving  effect  thereto and to any
concurrent  prepayments  hereunder,  the Total  Outstandings  would  exceed  the
Aggregate Commitments,  and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitments,  the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit
exceeds  the  amount  of the  Aggregate  Commitments,  such  Sublimit  shall  be
automatically  reduced by the amount of such excess.  The  Administrative  Agent
will promptly  notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction
of the Aggregate  Commitments.  Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall
be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All
commitment  fees accrued  until the  effective  date of any  termination  of the
Aggregate  Commitments  shall be paid on the effective date of such termination,
on the amount terminated.

         2.07 Repayment of Loans.

         (a)  The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the
aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding on such date.

         (b)  The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to
occur of (i) the demand of Administrative Agent and (ii) the Maturity Date.

         2.08 Interest.

         (a)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A)
the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (y) the
Applicable Margin, and (B) the Maximum Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) the sum
of (x) the Base Rate plus (y) the Applicable Margin, and (B) the Maximum Rate;
and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to
the lesser of (A) the sum of (x) the Base Rate plus (y) the Applicable Margin,
and (B) the Maximum Rate.

         (b)  If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is
not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore,
while any Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the
principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
demand.

         (c)  Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
<PAGE>
         2.09 Fees.  In addition to certain fees described in subsections
(i) and (j) of Section 2.03:

         (a)  Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to the Applicable Margin for commitment fees times the
actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the
Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each April, July, October, and January,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Maturity Date. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and
if there is any change in the Applicable Margin during any quarter, the actual
daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin
separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin was
in effect.

         (b)  Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when
paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

         (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been
separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
reason whatsoever.

         2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is  determined  by Bank of  America's  "prime
rate"  shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed.  All other  computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year (unless such calculation  would result in
the interest on the  Borrowings  exceeding the Maximum Rate, in which event such
interest  shall be  calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be) and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable,  being  paid  than if  computed  on the  basis of a  365-day  year).
Interest  shall  accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made,  and
shall not accrue on a Loan,  or any  portion  thereof,  for the day on which the
Loan or such portion is paid,  provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same
day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one
day.

         2.11 Evidence of Debt.

         (a)  The Loans owed to each Lender shall be evidenced by the Notes, one
payable to each Lender in the maximum stated principal amount of its Commitment.
Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type
(if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect
thereto.
<PAGE>
         (b)  Each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained
by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error.

         2.12 Payments Generally.

         (a)  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

         (b)  If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day
other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business
Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or
fees, as the case may be.

         (c)  Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative
Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case
may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and
may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that
such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds, then:

         (i)  if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender
         shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion
         of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in
         immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect
         of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
         by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is
         repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
         the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

         (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender
         shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount
         thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon
         for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included
         in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount
         forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the
         Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and
         the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate
         per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable
         Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from
         its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights
         which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any
         Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
<PAGE>
         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (d)  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds
for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions
of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension
set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

         (e)  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans
and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several
and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to fund
any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any
other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Committed Loan or purchase its participation.

         (f)  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.13 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made
by it, or the  participations  in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by
it, any payment  (whether  voluntary,  involuntary,  through the exercise of any
right of set-off,  or  otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated  hereunder)  thereof,  such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
Administrative  Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Committed Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations
in the  participations  in L/C  Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as
the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing  Lender to share
the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans or such participations, as
the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided,  however,  that if all or
any portion of such excess  payment is thereafter  recovered from the purchasing
Lender  under any of the  circumstances  described in Section  11.06  (including
pursuant  to any  settlement  entered  into  by  the  purchasing  Lender  in its
discretion),  such  purchase  shall to that extent be  rescinded  and each other
Lender shall repay to the  purchasing  Lender the purchase  price paid therefor,
together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's  ratable share  (according
to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's  required  repayment
to (ii) the  total  amount  so  recovered  from the  purchasing  Lender)  of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing  Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered,  without further interest  thereon.  The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to
the  fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  exercise  all its  rights  of  payment
(including  the right of set-off,  but subject to Section 11.09) with respect to
such  participation  as fully as if such Lender were the direct  creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep
records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)
of participations  purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a
participation  pursuant to this Section  shall from and after such purchase have
the  right  to  give  all  notices,  requests,  demands,  directions  and  other
communications  under  this  Agreement  with  respect  to  the  portion  of  the
Obligations  purchased to the same extent as though the  purchasing  Lender were
the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01 Taxes.

         (a)  Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall
be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty (30) days after the
date of such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent
(which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy
of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
<PAGE>
         (b)  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)  If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or
Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii) amounts
payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including additions to
tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment
under this subsection (d) shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date
the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful,  or that any Governmental  Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any  Lender  or its  applicable  Lending  Office to make,  maintain  or fund
Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar  Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the  Administrative  Agent,  any  obligation  of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower that the circumstances  giving rise to such determination no longer
exist.  Upon receipt of such notice,  the Borrower shall,  upon demand from such
Lender  (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent),  prepay or, if  applicable,
convert all Eurodollar  Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans,  either on
the last day of the  Interest  Period  therefor,  if such  Lender  may  lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately,  if
such Lender may not lawfully  continue to maintain such  Eurodollar  Rate Loans.
Upon any such  prepayment  or  conversion,  the Borrower  shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender agrees to designate
a  different  Lending  Office if such  designation  will avoid the need for such
notice and will not, in the good faith  judgment of such  Lender,  otherwise  be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
<PAGE>
         3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative
Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the
obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may
revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the
amount specified therein.

         3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.

         (a)  If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's
compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as
the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction
in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of
the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased
costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of
which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve
requirements, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost
or reduction.

         (b)  If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to
time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

         3.05 Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

         (a)  any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise); or
<PAGE>
         (b)  any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower; including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds
were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees
charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. A certificate
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this
Article III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining
such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

         3.07 Survival. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                              Article IV. SECURITY

         4.01 Collateral. To secure the full and complete payment and
performance of the Obligations, Borrower shall execute and deliver or cause to

sole discretion, deem necessary or desirable to evidence and perfect the

         (g)  Collateral includes, without limitation, the following assets of

impair the Obligations, or liens upon or obligations of Borrower or any
Guarantor in respect of all interests retained by the Borrower and Guarantors,
including, without limitation, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall
continue to constitute Collateral.

qualification or license, and (d) is in compliance with all Laws; except in each
case referred to in clause (b)(i),  (c) or (d), to the extent that failure to do
so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.02 Authorization; No Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance  by each Loan Party of each Loan  Document  to which such  Person is

breach  or  contravention  of,  or the  creation  of any  Lien  under,  (i)  any

injunction,  writ or decree of any Governmental  Authority or any arbitral award
to which such Person or its property is subject; or (c) violate any Law.
<PAGE>

Governmental Authority or any other Person is necessary or required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement

         6.04 Binding Effect. This Agreement has been, and each other Loan
Document, when delivered hereunder,  will have been, duly executed and delivered
by each Loan Party that is party thereto. This Agreement  constitutes,  and each
other Loan  Document  when so  delivered  will  constitute,  a legal,  valid and
binding obligation of such Loan Party,  enforceable against each Loan Party that
is party thereto in accordance with its terms.

         6.05 Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Effect.

         (a)  The Audited Financial Statements (i) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein; (ii) fairly present the financial condition
of the Companies as of the date thereof and their results of operations for the
period covered thereby in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout
the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted therein; and
(iii) show all material indebtedness and other liabilities, direct or
contingent, of the Companies as of the date thereof, including liabilities for
taxes, material commitments and Debt.

         (b)  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Companies
dated March 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income or
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal quarter ended on
that date (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted
therein, and (ii) fairly present the financial condition of the Companies as of
the date thereof and their results of operations for the period covered thereby,
subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the absence of footnotes and to
normal year-end audit adjustments. Schedule 6.05 sets forth all material
indebtedness and other liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Companies as of
the date of such financial statements, including liabilities for taxes, material
commitments and Debt.

         (c)  Since the date of the Audited Financial Statements, there has been
no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had
or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.06 Litigation. Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.06,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings,  claims or disputes pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower  after due and diligent  investigation,  threatened or
contemplated,  at law,  in equity,  in  arbitration  or before any  Governmental
Authority,  by or against the  Companies or against any of their  properties  or
revenues  that (a) purport to affect or pertain to this  Agreement  or any other
Loan Document,  or any of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  or (b) either
individually or in the aggregate,  if determined adversely,  could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
<PAGE>
         6.07 No Default. No Company is in default under or with respect to any
Contractual Obligation that could, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has
occurred and is continuing or would result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         6.08 Ownership of Property; Liens. Each Company has good record and
marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real
property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of its business, except for

course of  business a review of the effect of  existing  Environmental  Laws and
claims  alleging  potential  liability or  responsibility  for  violation of any
Environmental Law on their respective businesses, operations and properties, and
as a result  thereof the  Borrower  has  reasonably  concluded  that,  except as
specifically  disclosed in Schedule  6.09,  such  Environmental  Laws and claims
could not,  individually  or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         6.10 Insurance. The properties of each Company are insured with
financially  sound and  reputable  insurance  companies  not  Affiliates  of the
Borrower,  in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are
customarily  carried  by  companies  engaged in  similar  businesses  and owning
similar properties in localities where the applicable Company operates.

         6.11 Taxes. Each Company has filed all Federal, state and other
material  tax  returns  and  reports  required  to be  filed,  and have paid all
Federal,   state  and  other  material  taxes,   assessments,   fees  and  other
governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties,  income or
assets otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good
faith by  appropriate  proceedings  diligently  conducted and for which adequate
reserves have been provided in  accordance  with GAAP.  There is no proposed tax
assessment  against any Company  that would,  if made,  have a Material  Adverse
Effect.

         6.12 ERISA Compliance.

         (a)  Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state Laws. Each
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter
is currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause
the loss of, such qualification. The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made
all required contributions to each Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and
no application for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan.
<PAGE>
         (b)  There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan that could be reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the
fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)  (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur;  (ii) no Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension  Liability;  (iii) neither
the Borrower nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has incurred,  or  reasonably  expects to
incur,  any  liability  under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan
(other than premiums due and not delinquent  under Section 4007 of ERISA);  (iv)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects
to incur,  any liability  (and no event has occurred  which,  with the giving of
notice  under  Section  4219 of ERISA,  would  result in such  liability)  under
Sections  4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a  Multiemployer  Plan;  and (v)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA  Affiliate has engaged in a transaction  that
could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

         6.13 Subsidiaries; Partnerships. Each of the Guarantors is a direct or
indirect  Wholly-owned  Subsidiary  of  Borrower,  and  as of the  date  hereof,
together  with the  Partnerships  and other  entities  listed on Schedule  6.13,
constitute all of the  Subsidiaries of Borrower.  Schedule 6.13, as the same may
be  amended  from  time  to  time  to  reflect  transactions  permitted  by this
Agreement,  sets  forth  the  outstanding  shares  of  capital  stock  (or other
ownership   interests)  and  the  name  of  each  shareholder  of  each  of  the
Subsidiaries of Borrower.  All of the outstanding  capital stock of each Company
has been validly issued, is fully paid, and is nonassessable.  Schedule 6.13, as
the same may be amended from time to time to reflect  transactions  permitted by
this  Agreement,  sets  forth  the  outstanding  partnership  interests  of  the
Partnerships owned by each of the Companies.

         6.14 Margin Regulations; Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding
Company Act.

         (a)  The Borrower is not engaged and will not engage, principally or as
one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying
margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB), or
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.

         (b)  None of the Borrower, any Person Controlling the Borrower, or any
Subsidiary (i) is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is required to be registered as an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
<PAGE>
         6.15 Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders all agreements,  instruments and corporate or other restrictions
to which it or any of its  Subsidiaries is subject,  and all other matters known
to it, that,  individually or in the aggregate,  could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. No report, financial statement, certificate
or other information furnished (whether in writing or orally) by or on behalf of
any Loan Party to the Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  and the  negotiation  of this  Agreement  or
delivered  hereunder  (as  modified  or  supplemented  by other  information  so
furnished)  contains  any  material  misstatement  of fact or omits to state any
material  fact  necessary to make the  statements  therein,  in the light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading;  provided that, with
respect to projected  financial  information,  the Borrower represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon  assumptions  believed to
be reasonable at the time.

         6.16 Compliance with Laws. Each Company is in compliance in all
material  respects  with the  requirements  of all Laws and all  orders,  writs,
injunctions and decrees  applicable to it or to its  properties,  except in such
instances in which (a) such  requirement  of Law or order,  writ,  injunction or
decree is being  contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings  diligently
conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith,  either individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.17 Operation of Business. Each of the Companies (other than the
Excepted Subsidiaries) possesses all licenses, permits, franchises, patents,
copyrights, trademarks, and tradenames, or rights thereto, necessary to conduct
their respective businesses substantially as now conducted and as presently
proposed to be conducted. None of the Companies is in violation of any valid
rights of others with respect to any of the foregoing (except where the failure
to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or properties of the Companies taken as a
whole, Borrower, or any Material Subsidiary).

         6.18 Debt. As of the date hereof, the Companies have no Debt, except as
disclosed on Schedule 8.03.

         6.19 Agreements. Except for the Senior Subordinated Indenture, the
Senior Subordinated Notes, and as set forth on Schedule 8.03, none of the
Companies is a party to any indenture, loan, or credit agreement, or to any
lease or other agreement or instrument, or subject to any charter or corporate
restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations or properties of
the Companies taken as a whole, Borrower, or any Material Subsidiary or the
ability of Borrower or any Guarantor to pay and perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents to which it is a party. None of the Companies is in default
in any material respect in the performance, observance, or fulfillment of any of
the obligations, covenants, or conditions contained in any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party, which default, in the aggregate with all such
other defaults, would have a material adverse affect on the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or properties of the Companies taken as a

of Borrower,  except in the ordinary  course of Borrower's or such  Subsidiary's

remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable
law;

amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the
obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as

of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         9.03 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for
in Section 9.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due
and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash
Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 9.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:


         First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as such;

         Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable
to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III),
ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second
payable to them;

accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the
Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third
payable to them;

unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by
them;

         Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer,
to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and

         Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be
applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any
amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have
either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to
the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                        ARTICLE X. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         10.01 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.

         (a)  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes
the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

         (b)  The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to
any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and
the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the
Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the definition of
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

         10.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of
its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         10.03 Liability of Administrative Agent. No Agent-Related Person shall
(a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be
responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure
of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

         (a)  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

         (b)  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

         10.05 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have  knowledge  or notice of the  occurrence  of any  Default,  except  with
respect to defaults in the payment of  principal,  interest and fees required to
be paid to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders,  unless the
Administrative  Agent shall have  received  written  notice from a Lender or the
Borrower  referring to this Agreement,  describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." The  Administrative  Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The  Administrative  Agent shall take
such action  with  respect to such  Default as may be  directed by the  Required
Lenders in accordance with Article IX; provided,  however, that unless and until
the  Administrative  Agent has received any such direction,  the  Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be  obligated  to) take such  action,  or refrain  from
taking such action,  with respect to such Default as it shall deem  advisable or
in the best interest of the Lenders.

         10.06 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative
Agent.  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that no  Agent-Related  Person  has made any
representation  or warranty to it, and that no act by the  Administrative  Agent
hereafter  taken,  including any consent to and  acceptance of any assignment or
review of the  affairs  of any Loan  Party or any  Affiliate  thereof,  shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related  Person
to any Lender as to any matter,  including  whether  Agent-Related  Persons have
disclosed  material  information in their possession.  Each Lender represents to
the  Administrative  Agent that it has,  independently and without reliance upon
any  Agent-Related  Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed  appropriate,  made  its own  appraisal  of and  investigation  into  the
business,  prospects,  operations,  property,  financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries,  and all
applicable  bank  or  other   regulatory  Laws  relating  to  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder.  Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem  appropriate  at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis,  appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such  investigations  as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects,   operations,   property,   financial   and   other   condition   and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative  Agent herein,  the  Administrative  Agent shall not have any
duty  or  responsibility  to  provide  any  Lender  with  any  credit  or  other
information concerning the business, prospects,  operations, property, financial
and other  condition  or  creditworthiness  of any of the Loan Parties or any of
their  respective   Affiliates  which  may  come  into  the  possession  of  any
Agent-Related Person.

         10.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. WHETHER OR NOT THE
TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY ARE CONSUMMATED,  THE LENDERS SHALL INDEMNIFY
UPON DEMAND EACH  AGENT-RELATED  PERSON (TO THE EXTENT NOT  REIMBURSED  BY OR ON
BEHALF OF ANY LOAN PARTY AND WITHOUT  LIMITING THE  OBLIGATION OF ANY LOAN PARTY
TO DO SO),  PRO RATA,  AND HOLD  HARMLESS  EACH  AGENT-RELATED  PERSON  FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL INDEMNIFIED  LIABILITIES INCURRED BY IT; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
THAT NO LENDER  SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT TO ANY  AGENT-RELATED  PERSON OF
ANY PORTION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT DETERMINED IN A FINAL,
NONAPPEALABLE  JUDGMENT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT  JURISDICTION  TO HAVE  RESULTED
FROM SUCH  AGENT-RELATED  PERSON'S OWN GROSS  NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO ACTION TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTIONS OF THE
REQUIRED  LENDERS  SHALL BE DEEMED TO  CONSTITUTE  GROSS  NEGLIGENCE  OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.  WITHOUT  LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING,
EACH LENDER SHALL REIMBURSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT UPON DEMAND FOR ITS RATABLE
SHARE OF ANY COSTS OR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEY COSTS) INCURRED
BY THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IN  CONNECTION  WITH THE  PREPARATION,  EXECUTION,
DELIVERY,  ADMINISTRATION,   MODIFICATION,  AMENDMENT  OR  ENFORCEMENT  (WHETHER
THROUGH  NEGOTIATIONS,  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR LEGAL ADVICE IN
RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR  RESPONSIBILITIES  UNDER,  THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT,  OR ANY DOCUMENT  CONTEMPLATED BY OR REFERRED TO HEREIN, TO THE EXTENT
THAT THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IS NOT  REIMBURSED  FOR SUCH  EXPENSES  BY OR ON
BEHALF  OF  THE  BORROWER.   THE  UNDERTAKING  IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  SURVIVE
TERMINATION OF THE AGGREGATE  COMMITMENTS,  THE PAYMENT OF ALL OTHER OBLIGATIONS
AND THE RESIGNATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         10.08 Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. Bank of America
and its  Affiliates  may make loans to, issue  letters of credit for the account
of, accept deposits from,  acquire equity  interests in and generally  engage in
any kind of banking,  trust, financial advisory,  underwriting or other business
with each of the Loan Parties and their respective  Affiliates as though Bank of
America  were not the  Administrative  Agent  or the L/C  Issuer  hereunder  and
without  notice to or consent of the  Lenders.  The  Lenders  acknowledge  that,
pursuant  to such  activities,  Bank of America or its  Affiliates  may  receive
information  regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates  (including  information
that may be subject to  confidentiality  obligations in favor of such Loan Party
or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative  Agent shall be under
no obligation to provide such  information  to them.  With respect to its Loans,
Bank of America  shall have the same rights and powers  under this  Agreement as
any other Lender and may  exercise  such rights and powers as though it were not
the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         10.09 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign as  Administrative  Agent upon thirty (30) days'  notice to the  Lenders;
provided that any such  resignation by Bank of America shall also constitute its
resignation  as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender.  If the  Administrative  Agent
resigns under this Agreement,  the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the
Lenders a  successor  administrative  agent  for the  Lenders,  which  successor
administrative  agent shall be  consented  to by the Borrower at all times other
than during the existence of an Event of Default  (which consent of the Borrower
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor  administrative
agent  is  appointed  prior  to the  effective  date of the  resignation  of the
Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent may appoint,  after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower,  a successor  administrative agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor  administrative
agent hereunder,  the Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall
succeed to all the  rights,  powers and  duties of the  retiring  Administrative
Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender and the respective terms "Administrative
Agent,"  "L/C  Issuer"  and  "Swing  Line  Lender"  shall  mean  such  successor
administrative  agent,  Letter of Credit  issuer and swing line lender,  and the
retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated  and the retiring L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's
rights,  powers  and duties as such shall be  terminated,  without  any other or
further act or deed on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender
or any other  Lender,  other than the  obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to
issue  letters of credit in  substitution  for the  Letters  of Credit,  if any,
outstanding  at the  time  of such  succession  or to  make  other  arrangements
satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of
the  retiring  L/C  Issuer  with  respect to such  Letters of Credit.  After any
retiring  Administrative  Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article X and Sections 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its
benefit  as to any  actions  taken  or  omitted  to be  taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor  administrative agent
has accepted  appointment  as  Administrative  Agent by the date which is thirty
(30) days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring  Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the  Administrative
Agent  hereunder  until such time,  if any, as the  Required  Lenders  appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

         10.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency   of   any   receivership,    insolvency,   liquidation,    bankruptcy,
reorganization,   arrangement,   adjustment,   composition   or  other  judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether  the  principal  of any  Loan or L/C  Obligation  shall  then be due and
payable as herein  expressed or by declaration or otherwise and  irrespective of
whether the  Administrative  Agent  shall have made any demand on the  Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

              (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to
         file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
         have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including
         any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
         respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and
         11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

              (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

         10.11 Collateral and Guaranty  Matters.  The Lenders  irrevocably
authorize the  Administrative  Agent, at its option and in its discretion,

              (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by
         the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination
         of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations
         (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration
         or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be
         sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or
         under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to Section 11.01, if
         approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;

              (b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held
         by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of
         any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 8.01(h); and

              (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
         Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
         transaction permitted hereunder.

         Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release
or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to
release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this
Section 10.12.

         10.12 Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers. None of the Lenders or
other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement
as a "syndication  agent,"  "documentation  agent,"  "co-agent," "book manager,"
"lead  manager,"  "arranger,"  "lead arranger" or  "co-arranger"  shall have any
right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement
other than,  in the case of such  Lenders,  those  applicable  to all Lenders as
such.  Without  limiting the foregoing,  none of the Lenders or other Persons so
identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary  relationship  with any
Lender.  Each Lender  acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this
Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE XI.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document,  and no consent to any  departure by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing
signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as
the case may be, and  acknowledged by the  Administrative  Agent,  and each such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given;  provided,  however, that, except as permitted

Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

         (d)  reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (iv) of the second proviso
to this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any
other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall
be necessary to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any
obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate;

         (e)  change Section 2.13 or Section 9.03 in a manner that would alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of

"Required  Lenders"  or any other  provision  hereof  specifying  the  number or

written consent of each Lender;

         (g)  release any Guarantor from the Guaranty without the written
consent of each Lender; or

         (h)  release all or substantially all of the Collateral;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Letter
of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by

thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

         11.02 Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.

         (a)  General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices

(c) below) electronic mail address, and all notices and other communications
expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the
applicable telephone number, as follows:

              (i)  if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C
         Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified for such Person
         on Schedule 11.02 or to such other address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by
         such party in a notice to the other parties; and

              (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four (4) Business Days

communications to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line
Lender pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until actually received by
such Person. In no event shall a voicemail message be effective as a notice,
communication or confirmation hereunder.

         (b)  Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted  and/or signed by facsimile.  The  effectiveness of
any such documents and  signatures  shall,  subject to applicable  Law, have the
same force and effect as  manually-signed  originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
may also  require  that any such  documents  and  signatures  be  confirmed by a
manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile  document
or signature.

         (c)  Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet and
intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as
financial statements and other information as provided in Section 7.02, and to
distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may not be
used for any other purpose.

         (d)  Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices
(including telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices)
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were
not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or
followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms
thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.
The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all
losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such
Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All
telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may
be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to such recording.

         11.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

         11.04 Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Borrower agrees (a) to
pay or reimburse the Administrative  Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred  in  connection  with the  development,  preparation,  negotiation  and
execution of this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  and any  amendment,
waiver,  consent or other  modification  of the  provisions  hereof and  thereof
(whether   or  not  the   transactions   contemplated   hereby  or  thereby  are
consummated),  and  the  consummation  and  administration  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby and thereby,  including all reasonable  Attorney Costs, and
(b) to pay or reimburse the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender for all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement,
or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents  (including all such costs and expenses  incurred during any "workout"
or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal  proceeding,
including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law),  including all reasonable
Attorney  Costs.  The  foregoing  costs and expenses  shall  include all search,
filing,  recording,  title  insurance and  appraisal  charges and fees and taxes
related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and the cost of independent  public  accountants and other outside experts
retained by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this
Section  11.04  shall be payable  within  ten (10)  Business  Days after  demand
therefor.  The  agreements in this Section shall survive the  termination of the
Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

         11.05 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER. WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY ARE CONSUMMATED, THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD
HARMLESS EACH AGENT-RELATED PERSON, EACH LENDER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, COUNSEL, AGENTS AND ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT
(COLLECTIVELY THE "INDEMNITEES") FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES,
OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS,
SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DISBURSEMENTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEY COSTS) OF ANY KIND

ADMINISTRATION OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, LETTER OR INSTRUMENT
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE
CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, (B) ANY COMMITMENT, LOAN
OR LETTER OF CREDIT OR THE USE OR PROPOSED USE OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM
(INCLUDING ANY REFUSAL BY THE L/C ISSUER TO HONOR A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT UNDER A

NOT STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT), OR (C) ANY ACTUAL
OR ALLEGED PRESENCE OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON OR FROM ANY PROPERTY
CURRENTLY OR FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED BY THE BORROWER, ANY SUBSIDIARY OR ANY
OTHER LOAN PARTY, OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE
BORROWER, ANY SUBSIDIARY OR ANY OTHER LOAN PARTY, OR (D) ANY ACTUAL OR
PROSPECTIVE CLAIM, LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF
THE FOREGOING, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY (INCLUDING
ANY INVESTIGATION OF, PREPARATION FOR, OR DEFENSE OF ANY PENDING OR THREATENED
CLAIM, INVESTIGATION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING) AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY
INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO (ALL THE FOREGOING, COLLECTIVELY, THE "INDEMNIFIED
LIABILITIES"), IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY
SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS,
JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT (I) TO HAVE RESULTED
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR SOLELY DUE
TO THE BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY AN INDEMNITEE OR (II) TO HAVE ARISEN SOLELY
BY REASON OF CLAIMS BETWEEN THE LENDERS OR ANY LENDER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT .

ANY INDEMNITEE HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR ARISING OUT OF ITS
ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH (WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE
CLOSING DATE). ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THIS SECTION 10.05 SHALL BE PAYABLE WITHIN
TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER DEMAND THEREFOR. THE AGREEMENTS IN THIS SECTION
SHALL SURVIVE THE RESIGNATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE REPLACEMENT OF
ANY LENDER, THE TERMINATION OF THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS AND THE REPAYMENT,
SATISFACTION OR DISCHARGE OF ALL THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

         11.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender  exercises  its right of  set-off,  and such
payment or the  proceeds  of such  set-off or any part  thereof is  subsequently
invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or  preferential,  set aside or required
(including  pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative  Agent
or such  Lender in its  discretion)  to be repaid to a trustee,  receiver or any
other party,  in connection  with any proceeding  under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise,  then (a) to the  extent of such  recovery,  the  obligation  or part
thereof  originally  intended to be satisfied  shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such  payment had not been made or such  set-off had
not occurred,  and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid
by the Administrative  Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal  Funds
Rate from time to time in effect.

         11.07 Successors and Assigns.

         (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions
of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b)  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement
(including  all or a portion  of its  Commitment  and the Loans  (including  for
purposes of this subsection (b),  participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing
Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning  Lender's  Commitment
and the  Loans at the time  owing  to it or in the  case of an  assignment  to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection
(g) of this  Section)  with  respect to a Lender,  the  aggregate  amount of the
Commitment  (which  for this  purpose  includes  Loans  outstanding  thereunder)
subject to each such  assignment,  determined as of the date the  Assignment and
Assumption  with respect to such  assignment is delivered to the  Administrative
Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and  Assumption,  as of
the  Trade  Date,  shall  not  be  less  than  $5,000,000  unless  each  of  the
Administrative  Agent and,  so long as no Event of Default has  occurred  and is
continuing,  the  Borrower  otherwise  consents  (each  such  consent  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate  part of all the assigning  Lender's rights and
obligations  under this  Agreement  with respect to the Loans or the  Commitment
assigned,  except  that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of
Swing Line Loans;  (iii) any assignment of a Commitment  must be approved by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender unless the Person
that is the  proposed  assignee is itself a Lender  (whether or not the proposed
assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee);  and (iv) the parties
to each  assignment  shall  execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent an
Assignment and  Assumption,  together with a processing and  recordation  fee of
$3,500.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection  (c) of this Section,  from and after the effective  date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption,  the Eligible  Assignee  thereunder
shall be a party to this Agreement  and, to the extent of the interest  assigned
by such Assignment and  Assumption,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement,  and the assigning Lender  thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Assumption  covering all of the assigning  Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections  3.01,  3.04,  3.05,  11.04 and 11.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment).  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  that does not  comply  with this
subsection  shall be treated for  purposes of this  Agreement  as a sale by such
Lender of a  participation  in such rights and  obligations  in accordance  with
subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d)  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a
Lender.

         (e)  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 11.15 as though
it were a Lender.

         (f)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note,
if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment
to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         (g)  As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

              "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a
         Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a
         natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, the L/C
         Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (each such approval not to
         be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the
         foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of
         the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

              "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.

              "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed
         by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at
any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to
subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty (30) days' notice to
the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty (30)
days' notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any
such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be
entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line
Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint
any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer
or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C
Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer
hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective
date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect
thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed
Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section
2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all
the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing
Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such
resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate
Committed Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans
pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

         11.08 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the  confidentiality  of the  Information (as defined below),
except  that  Information  may  be  disclosed  (a) to its  and  its  Affiliates'
directors,  officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be  informed of the  confidential  nature of such  Information  and
instructed to keep such Information  confidential);  (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory  authority;  (c) to the extent  required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process;  (d) to any other party
to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding  relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder;  (f) subject to a written agreement  containing  provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of
or Participant  in, or any prospective  Eligible  Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its  rights or  obligations  under this  Agreement  or (ii) any direct or
indirect   contractual   counterparty  or  prospective   counterparty  (or  such
contractual counterparty's or prospective  counterparty's  professional advisor)
to any  credit  derivative  transaction  relating  to  obligations  of the  Loan
Parties; (g) with the express written consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent
such  Information  (i) becomes  publicly  available  other than as a result of a
breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential  basis from a source other than the Borrower; or
(i) to the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners or any other similar
organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose
the existence of this Agreement and  information  about this Agreement to market
data collectors,  similar service providers to the lending industry, and service
providers to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders in  connection  with the
administration and management of this Agreement,  the other Loan Documents,  the
Commitments,  and the  Credit  Extensions.  For the  purposes  of this  Section,
"Information" means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any
Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender on a  nonconfidential  basis  prior to
disclosure   by  any  Loan  Party.   Any  Person   required   to  maintain   the
confidentiality  of  Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied  with its  obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the  confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

         11.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of any Event of
Default,  each Lender is authorized  at any time and from time to time,  without
prior  notice to the  Borrower  or any other Loan Party,  any such notice  being
waived by the  Borrower  (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to
the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time held by,
and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or
the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing
to such Lender  hereunder  or under any other Loan  Document,  now or  hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender
shall have made  demand  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  and
although such  Obligations  may be contingent or unmatured or  denominated  in a
currency  different from that of the applicable  deposit or  indebtedness.  Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender;  provided,  however,  that
the failure to give such notice  shall not affect the  validity of such  set-off
and application.

         11.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Regardless of any provision contained
in any Loan Document,  neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall ever be
entitled to contract for, charge, take, reserve,  receive, or apply, as interest
on all or any part of the Obligations, any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate,
and,  if  Lenders  ever do so,  then  such  excess  shall be  deemed  a  partial
prepayment of principal and treated  hereunder as such and any remaining  excess
shall be refunded to Borrower.  In  determining  if the interest paid or payable
exceeds the Maximum  Rate,  Borrower and Lenders  shall,  to the maximum  extent
permitted  under  applicable  Law,  (a)  treat  all  Borrowings  as but a single
extension of credit (and  Lenders and  Borrower  agree that such is the case and
that provision  herein for multiple  Borrowings is for  convenience  only),  (b)
characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
as interest,  (c) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d)
amortize,  prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout
the entire contemplated term of the Obligations. However, if the Obligations are
paid  and  performed  in full  prior to the end of the  full  contemplated  term
thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof
exceeds the Maximum  Amount,  Lenders  shall  refund such  excess,  and, in such
event,  Lenders  shall not,  to the extent  permitted  by Law, be subject to any
penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving,
or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount.

         11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         11.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior  agreements,  written
or oral,  on such  subject  matter.  In the event of any  conflict  between  the
provisions  of  this  Agreement  and  those  of any  other  Loan  Document,  the
provisions  of this  Agreement  shall  control;  provided  that the inclusion of
supplemental  rights or  remedies  in favor of the  Administrative  Agent or the
Lenders in any other  Loan  Document  shall not be deemed a  conflict  with this
Agreement.  Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint  participation  of the
respective  parties thereto and shall be construed  neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

         11.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         11.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan  Documents  is  held  to be  illegal,  invalid  or  unenforceable,  (a) the
legality,  validity  and  enforceability  of the  remaining  provisions  of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties  shall  endeavor in good faith  negotiations  to replace the
illegal,  invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible  to that of the  illegal,  invalid or
unenforceable  provisions.  The  invalidity  of  a  provision  in  a  particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render  unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         11.15 Tax Forms. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States
person"  within  the  meaning  of Section  7701(a)(30)  of the Code (a  "Foreign
Lender")  shall  deliver to the  Administrative  Agent,  prior to receipt of any
payment  subject to withholding  under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment
of an  interest  herein),  two duly signed  completed  copies of either IRS Form
W-8BEN or any successor  thereto  (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling
it to an exemption from, or reduction of,  withholding tax on all payments to be
made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement) or IRS
Form W-8ECI or any  successor  thereto  (relating  to all payments to be made to
such Foreign  Lender by the Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement) or such other
evidence  satisfactory  to the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent that such
Foreign  Lender  is  entitled  to an  exemption  from,  or  reduction  of,  U.S.
withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code.
Thereafter  and from time to time,  each such Foreign  Lender shall (A) promptly
submit to the  Administrative  Agent such  additional  duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such  successor  forms as shall be adopted  from
time to time by the relevant  United States taxing  authorities)  as may then be
available  under then current United States laws and  regulations  to avoid,  or
such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in
respect  of all  payments  to be made to such  Foreign  Lender  by the  Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement,  (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any
change  in  circumstances  which  would  modify or render  invalid  any  claimed
exemption  or  reduction,  and (C) take such  steps as shall  not be  materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable  judgment of such Lender, and as may be
reasonably  necessary  (including the  re-designation  of its Lending Office) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

         (ii) Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to
act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable
to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a
typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with
respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times
as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of
the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth
above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to
which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S.
withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or
any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to
transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption
required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

         (iii) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount
to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required
to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant
to this Section 11.15(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender
shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date such
Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any
payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 11.15(a) shall
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section
3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which
such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not
subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

         (iv) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the
Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay
additional amounts under this Section 11.15(a).

         (b)  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is
a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of
IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

         (c)  If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

         11.16 Governing Law.

         (a)  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF TEXAS APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL
RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         (b)  ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
SITTING IN TRAVIS COUNTY OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF
SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS
PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING
ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON
CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER
DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER
WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE
MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

         11.17 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,  ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION  ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
OR RELATED OR  INCIDENTAL  TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES  HERETO OR ANY OF THEM
WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT,  OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING,  AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT
OR TORT OR  OTHERWISE;  AND EACH PARTY HEREBY  AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT
A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR
A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN  EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

         11.18 Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents.

         11.19 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the final agreement AMONG the parties and may not be contradicted by
evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements of the
parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements AMONG the parties.

         11.20 Restatement of Original Credit Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that, after all conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.01 have been
satisfied or waived: (a) the Obligations (as defined herein) represent, among
other things, the amendment, extension, and modification of the "Obligations"
(as defined in the Original Credit Agreement); (b) this Agreement is intended
to, and does hereby, restate, consolidate, renew, extend, amend, modify,
supersede, and replace the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety; (c) the
Notes, if any, executed pursuant to this Agreement amend, renew, extend, modify,
replace, substitute for, and supersede in their entirety (but do not extinguish,
the Debt arising under) the promissory notes issued pursuant to the Original
Credit Agreement, which existing promissory notes shall be returned to
Administrative Agent promptly after the Closing Date, marked "cancelled and
replaced," and, thereafter, delivered by Administrative Agent to Borrower; and
(d) the entering into and performance of their respective obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions evidenced hereby do not constitute a novation.

         11.21 Chapter 346. Borrower agrees that Chapter 346, of the Texas
Finance Code, as amended (which regulates certain revolving credit loan
documents and revolving tri-party accounts) does not apply to the Obligations.

         11.22 Restatement. On the Closing Date, (i) all outstanding Obligations
under the Original Credit Agreement owed to any "Lender" that is not continuing
as a Lender under this Agreement (each a "Non-Continuing Lender") shall be
repaid in full by Borrower and such Non-Continuing Lender's commitment under the
Original Credit Agreement shall be terminated and (ii) with respect to Lenders
under the Original Credit Agreement and any new Lenders which are continuing as
Lenders under this Agreement (the "Continuing Lenders"), Administrative Agent
shall make appropriate allocations and adjustments in the initial funding
instructions to the Lenders to reflect the modifications effected by the Loan
Documents to each Continuing Lender's Commitment.
