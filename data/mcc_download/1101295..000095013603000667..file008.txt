1.2      SERIES SUPPLEMENT AND MASTER TRUST DEED DEFINITIONS

         phrases defined in either or both of the Master Trust Deed and the
         Series Supplement have the same meaning in this Agreement. Where there
         is any inconsistency in a definition between this Agreement (on the one
         hand) and the Master Trust Deed or the Series Supplement (on the other
         hand), this Agreement prevails. Where there is any inconsistency in a
         definition between the Master Trust Deed and the Series Supplement, the
         Series Supplement prevails over the Master Trust Deed in respect of
         this Agreement. Subject to clause 1.6, where words or phrases used but
         not defined in this Agreement are defined in the Master Trust Deed in
         relation to a Series Trust (as defined in the Master Trust Deed) and/or
         an Other Trust such words or phrases are to be construed in this
         Agreement, where necessary, as being used only in relation to the
         Series Trust (as defined in this Agreement) and/or the CBA Trust, as
         the context requires.

         (c)      (SUCCEEDING INTEREST PERIODS): Each succeeding Interest Period
                  commences on (and includes) a Distribution Date and ends on

         (d)      (LAST INTEREST PERIOD): The last Interest Period ends on (but
                  excludes) the first Distribution Date that:

                  (i)      follows the Termination Date; and

                  (ii)     upon which all moneys the payment or repayment of

         Interest in respect of a Drawing accrues from day to day in respect of

5.3      PAYMENT OF INTEREST

         The Trustee at the direction of the Manager will on each Distribution

         If any payment by the Trustee on a Distribution Date pursuant to clause
         5.3 is insufficient to pay the full amount of the then accrued interest
         on a Drawing, such unpaid accrued interest will in turn accrue interest
         (as a separate and independent obligation) until paid at the Prescribed
         Rate for each succeeding Interest Period and if not paid on the
         Distribution Date at the end of each such succeeding Interest Period,
         will itself bear interest in accordance with this clause.



                                                                               9

         If any change in applicable law, regulation, treaty or official
         directive or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
         Governmental Agency charged with the administration thereof makes it,

         evidenced in writing and addressed to the Trustee, unlawful or
         impossible for the Liquidity Facility Provider to maintain or give
         effect to its obligations under this Agreement, the Liquidity Facility

         prior to 30 days (or such shorter period required by law) after the

                                                                              12

9.2      INCREASED COST

         (a)      (CHANGE IN LAW): If by reason of any change in law or in its
                  interpretation or administration or because of compliance with
                  any request from or requirement of any fiscal, monetary or
                  other Governmental Agency:

                  (i)      the Liquidity Facility Provider incurs a cost as a
                           result of its having entered into or performing its
                           obligations under this Agreement or as a result of
                           any Advance being outstanding hereunder;

                  (ii)     there is any increase in the cost to the Liquidity
                           Facility Provider of funding or maintaining any
                           Advance;

                  (iii)    the amount of principal, interest or other amount
                           payable to the Liquidity Facility Provider or the
                           effective return to the Liquidity Facility Provider
                           under this Agreement is reduced; or

                  (iv)     the Liquidity Facility Provider becomes liable to
                           make any payment (not being a payment of Tax on its
                           overall net income) on or calculated by reference to
                           the amount of Advances made under this Agreement,

                  then from time to time on notification by the Liquidity
                  Facility Provider (with a copy to the Manager) the Trustee
                  will on the Distribution Date following such notification and
                  on each succeeding Distribution Date until the Liquidity
                  Facility Provider is paid in full pay to the Liquidity
                  Facility Provider so much of the amounts sufficient to
                  indemnify the Liquidity Facility Provider against such cost,
                  increased cost, reduction or liability that is available for
                  this purpose in accordance with the Series Supplement.

         (b)      (NO DEFENCE): If the Liquidity Facility Provider has acted in
                  good faith it will not be a defence to the Trustee, in the
                  event of any failure by the Trustee to comply with its payment
                  obligations under clause 9.2(a), that any such cost, increased
                  cost, reduction or liability could have been avoided. However,
                  the Liquidity Facility Provider will negotiate in good faith
                  with the Trustee and the Manager with a view to finding a
                  means by which such cost, increased cost, reduction or
                  liability may be minimised.

         (c)      (CERTIFICATE CONCLUSIVE): The Liquidity Facility Provider's
                  certificate as to the amount of, and basis for arriving at,
                  any such cost, increased cost, reduction or liability is
                  conclusive and binding on the Trustee in the absence of
                  manifest error on the face of the certificate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.      FEES

         The Trustee will pay to the Liquidity Facility Provider a commitment
         fee of 0.10% per annum of the then un-utilised portion of the Facility
         Limit. The commitment fee will be calculated daily from the date the
         Facility becomes available on the basis of a 365 day year and will be
         paid in arrears on each Distribution Date in accordance with the Series
         Supplement. The amount of the commitment fee may be varied by agreement
         between the Trustee, the Manager and the Liquidity Facility Provider
         provided that each Rating Agency is given not less than 3 Business Days
         prior notice by the Manager of any variation to the amount of the
         commitment fee and the amount of the commitment fee will not be varied
         if such variation would result in a reduction, qualification or
         withdrawal by a Rating Agency of its then current credit rating of a
         Security. To the extent that such funds are not sufficient to pay the
         fee in full, the fee must be paid from the funds available on each
         succeeding Distribution Date until paid in full.



                                                                              13

15.      TRUSTEE PROVISIONS

15.1     LIMITATION ON TRUSTEE'S LIABILITY

         The Trustee enters into this Agreement only in its capacity as trustee
         of the Series Trust and in no other capacity. A liability incurred by
         the Trustee acting in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust
         arising under or in connection with this Agreement is limited to and
         can be enforced against the Trustee only to the extent to which it can
         be satisfied out of the Assets of the Series Trust out of which the
         Trustee is actually indemnified for the liability. This limitation of
         the Trustee's liability applies despite any other provision of this
         Agreement (other than clause 15.3) and extends to all liabilities and
         obligations of the Trustee in any way connected with any
         representation, warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction
         related to this Agreement.

         (except in relation to the Assets of the Series Trust), a liquidator,
         an administrator or any similar person to the Trustee, or prove in any

15.3     BREACH OF TRUST

         The provisions of this clause 15 will not apply to any obligation or
         liability of the Trustee to the extent that it is not satisfied because
         under the Master Trust Deed, the Series Supplement, any other
         Transaction Document in relation to the Series Trust or by operation of
         law there is a reduction in the extent of the Trustee's indemnification
         out of the Assets of the Series Trust as a result of the Trustee's
         fraud, negligence or wilful default.

15.4     ACTS OR OMISSIONS

         It is acknowledged that the Relevant Parties are responsible under the
         Transaction Documents for performing a variety of obligations relating
         to the Series Trust. No act or omission of the Trustee (including any
         related failure to satisfy its obligations or any breach of
         representations or warranties under this Agreement) will be considered
         fraud, negligence or wilful default of the Trustee for the purpose of
         clause 15.3 to the extent to which the act or omission was caused or
         contributed to by any failure by any Relevant Party or any other person
         appointed by the Trustee under any Transaction Document (other than a
         person whose acts or omissions the Trustee is liable for in accordance
         with any Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations in relation to
         the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of a Relevant Party or
         any other such person.

15.5     NO OBLIGATION

         The Trustee is not obliged to enter into any commitment or obligation
         under this Agreement or any Transaction Document (including incur any
         further liability) unless the Trustee's liability is limited in a
         manner which is consistent with this clause 15 or otherwise in a manner
         satisfactory to the Trustee in its absolute discretion.



                                                                              18
