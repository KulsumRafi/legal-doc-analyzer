         (a)      In consideration of the Support to be provided by EDC under
                  the Small Bonds Facility pursuant to the Facility Agreement,
                  the Principal hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to
                  indemnify EDC, against all claims and demands made against EDC
                  under or with respect to the EDC Support Agreements executed
                  with respect to the Small Bonds Facility, including any amount
                  that EDC pays under such EDC Support Agreements, and against
                  all costs (including the costs of enforcing the indemnity
                  under this Section 2(a)), expenses and damages incurred by
                  EDC, directly or indirectly, and arising or resulting from
                  such claims or demands. The Principal also agrees, as part of
                  its indemnification obligations under this Section 2(a), to
                  pay interest to EDC at Libor plus such margin per annum as is
                  separately agreed in writing by EDC and the Principal on any
                  amount for which indemnification is to be provided under this
                  Section 2(a) (including the said costs and expenses), such
                  interest to accrue from the date of demand by EDC to the date
                  of payment both before and after demand and judgment.

         (b)      In consideration of the Support to be provided by EDC under
                  the Receivables Bonding Facility and the General Support
                  Facility pursuant to the Facility Agreement, the Principal
                  hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to indemnify EDC
                  against all claims and demands made against EDC under or with
                  respect to the EDC Support Agreements executed with respect to
                  the Receivables Bonding Facility or the General Support
                  Facility, as applicable, including any amount that EDC pays
                  under such EDC Support Agreements or any unpaid


                                       2

<PAGE>

                  amount owed to EDC as a result of the exercise by EDC of any
                  put or similar right in respect of any such EDC Support
                  Agreements, and against all costs (including the costs of
                  enforcing the indemnity under this Section 2(b)), expenses and
                  damages incurred by EDC, directly or indirectly, and arising
                  or resulting from such claims or demands. The Principal also
                  agrees, as part of its indemnification obligations under this
                  Section 2(b), to pay interest to EDC at Libor plus such margin
                  per annum as is separately agreed in writing by EDC and the
                  Principal on any amount for which indemnification is to be
                  provided under this Section 2(b) (including the said costs and
                  expenses), such interest to accrue from the date of demand by
                  EDC to the date of payment both before and after demand and
                  judgment.

         (c)      Payments due to EDC hereunder shall be made to EDC in the
                  currency in which the relevant payment or payments under the
                  EDC Support Agreements for which indemnification is being
                  sought under Section 2(a) or Section 2(b), as applicable, were
                  made by EDC and, in the case of costs and expenses, in the
                  currency in which such costs and expenses were incurred.

         (d)      The Principal agrees that its liability hereunder shall not be
                  varied or discharged by reason of the EDC Support Agreements
                  or any of them, or any related document, being or becoming, in
                  whole or in part, illegal, unenforceable, void or discharged,
                  or by reason of any negligence on the part of EDC except to
                  the extent that such negligence constitutes gross negligence
                  or wilful misconduct in which case the liability of the
                  Principal hereunder shall be varied or discharged, but only to
                  the extent that such gross negligence or wilful misconduct:
                  (i) was the direct and primary cause of a claim or demand
                  being made against EDC under an EDC Support Agreement; or (ii)
                  increased the liability of the Principal hereunder. The
                  Principal's liability hereunder shall not otherwise be varied,
                  discharged or released except by full payment to EDC of all
                  amounts payable to EDC hereunder. Without limiting the
                  foregoing, the Principal's liability hereunder shall continue
                  with respect to and include any amounts that EDC may be
                  required to pay pursuant to the terms of an EDC Support
                  Agreement that deem such EDC Support Agreement to continue to
                  be effective or to be reinstated after the date on which EDC's
                  liability under such EDC Support Agreement would otherwise
                  have expired.

         (e)      Any computation of interest hereunder shall take into account
                  the actual number of days occurring in the period for which
                  interest is payable and on the basis of a 360-day year. For
                  the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) the interest
                  rate payable, expressed as an annual rate, shall be equivalent
                  to the applicable rate based on a year of 360 days, multiplied
                  by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the
                  period for which such interest is payable (or compounded)
                  ends, and divided by 360, (ii) the principle of deemed
                  reinvestments of interest does not apply to any such interest
                  calculation and (iii)


                                       3

<PAGE>

                  the rate of interest specified in this Indemnity Agreement is
                  intended to be a nominal rate and not an effective rate or
                  yield.


3.       EDC MAY ACT IN ITS DISCRETION

         (a)      The Principal absolutely and irrevocably authorizes EDC to:
                  (i) pay immediately at EDC's absolute and sole discretion, in
                  whole or in part, any amounts which, in EDC's reasonable
                  opinion, are required to be paid pursuant to the requirements
                  of any EDC Support Agreement; and (ii) enter into any
                  agreement with a Beneficiary for the purpose of discharging,
                  in whole or in part, EDC's obligations under an EDC Support
                  Agreement. EDC will give written notice to the Principal no
                  less than one (1) Business Day prior to making any payment
                  under an EDC Support Agreement or entering into any such
                  agreement with a Beneficiary.

         (b)      The Principal waives any requirement that EDC make demand
                  upon, or seek to enforce remedies against, any Person before
                  making demand for payment hereunder, or seeking to enforce any
                  of its rights hereunder, or enforcing any security therefor,
                  and EDC shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse against any
                  Person or any collateral it may hold (or that may be held on
                  its behalf), before demanding or being entitled to a payment
                  hereunder.

         (c)      EDC will not enter into, or consent to any amendments to the
                  provisions of, or issue any substitute for, or renew, any EDC
                  Support Agreement without the prior written consent of the
                  Principal provided that in no event shall any failure of EDC
                  to obtain such consent release the Principal from any
                  liability or obligations hereunder except to the extent that
                  such failure may result in the Principal incurring a liability
                  hereunder that it would not otherwise have incurred or
                  incurring a greater liability hereunder than it would
                  otherwise have incurred.


4.       UNDERTAKINGS OF THE PRINCIPAL

         (a)      Without prejudice to the Principal's rights under Section 2(d)
                  hereof and to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
                  Principal hereby waives any right of counterclaim, right of
                  set-off or deduction and the benefit of all privileges and
                  defences which now or hereafter may be available to the
                  Principal, including the benefit of discussion and division,
                  and the Principal waives diligence, presentment, demand,
                  protest and notice of every kind except as specifically
                  required hereunder or under any other Facility Document.

         (b)      If requested by EDC, the Principal will assign to EDC, by
                  instruments satisfactory to EDC and to the extent that the
                  Principal is not legally or contractually prohibited from
                  doing so, any rights that the Principal may have against any
                  party


                                       4

<PAGE>

                  to recover any sums demanded and paid under an EDC Support
                  Agreement until all such sums owed to EDC by the Principal
                  under this Indemnity Agreement with respect to such EDC
                  Support Agreement have been paid to EDC in full.

         (c)      The Principal agrees that its obligations under this Indemnity
                  Agreement (other than those under Section 2(b)) shall
                  constitute part of the Designated Contingent Obligations and
                  Designated Bank Debt for the purposes of the Security
                  Documents and that the EDC Support Agreements executed with
                  respect to the Small Bond Facility constitute part of the EDC
                  Facility as defined in the Security Agreements. The Principal
                  further agrees that it will designate all such obligations as
                  Secured Obligations (for purposes of the U.S. Security
                  Agreement) and as Secured Obligations and Guaranteed
                  Obligations (for purposes of the Canadian Security Agreement)
                  and therefore as Designated Contingent Obligations and
                  Designated Bank Debt for the purposes of the Security
                  Documents.

         (d)      The Principal agrees that its obligations under this Indemnity
                  Agreement (other than those under Section 2(a)) shall
                  constitute part of the Designated Contingent Obligations and
                  Designated Bank Debt for the purposes of the Security
                  Documents and that the EDC Support Agreements executed with
                  respect to the Receivables Bonding Facility or the General
                  Support Facility, as applicable, constitute part of the EDC
                  Facility as defined in the Security Agreements. The Principal
                  further agrees that it will designate all such obligations as
                  Secured Obligations (for purposes of the U.S. Security
                  Agreement) and as Secured Obligations and Guaranteed
                  Obligations (for purposes of the Canadian Security Agreement)
                  and therefore as Designated Contingent Obligations and
                  Designated Bank Debt for the purposes of the Security
                  Documents.

         (e)      Unless all sums owed by the Principal to EDC under this
                  Indemnity Agreement with respect to a particular EDC Support
                  Agreement have been paid in full, the Principal agrees that
                  (i) its right to receive payments or distributions of any kind
                  shall be, and it shall cause any such rights of its affiliates
                  to be, subordinate to the rights of EDC and (ii) it shall, and
                  it shall cause its affiliates to, hold in trust for, and pay
                  over to, EDC any payments or distributions of any kind
                  received by the Principal or any such affiliate, in each case,
                  in respect of any claim that the Principal or any such
                  affiliate may make as a creditor in the bankruptcy or
                  liquidation of the Person whose non-payment or whose call on
                  an instrument that was, in either case, covered by the terms
                  of such EDC Support Agreement resulted in a payment by EDC
                  under such EDC Support Agreement and further resulted in such
                  sums being owed to EDC hereunder.

5.       REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL

         The Principal represents and warrants to EDC that it is duly
         incorporated and validly subsisting under the laws of its place of

         authorized, executed and delivered by it and is valid and binding on
         it.


6.       APPLICATION OF RECOVERIES

         Any sums recovered in respect of a payment made pursuant to an EDC
         Support Agreement shall be first applied to the costs and expenses
         incurred by EDC to effect such recovery and then retained by EDC to the
         extent that any monies are due to EDC from the Principal pursuant to
         this Indemnity Agreement, provided that any monies remaining thereafter
         shall, subject to applicable law, be paid to the Principal.


7.       RIGHTS UNIMPAIRED

         and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights or
         remedies provided by law, in equity or otherwise and any waiver by EDC
         of the strict observance or performance of, or compliance with, any
         term of this Indemnity Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
         any other term or of any subsequent default or breach.


8.       TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF EDC SUPPORT AGREEMENTS

         EDC will not exercise any rights that it may have under any EDC Support
         Agreement to notify the Beneficiary thereof that such EDC Support
         Agreement has been terminated or suspended unless: (i) an Event of
         Default or a Specified Event of Default has occurred; or (ii) any call
         has been made on any Instrument issued on behalf of the Principal or
         any Subsidiary, whether or not such Instrument is subject to the
         Facility Agreement, which, together with any other calls for
         performance on any such Instruments after the date of the Facility
         Agreement, aggregates in excess of US $100,000,000; or (iii) the debt
         rating by Moody's or S&P with respect to senior secured long-term debt
         of the Principal shall have ceased to exist or shall have been
         downgraded to less than "B3" by Moody's or to less than "B minus" by
         S&P; and in each and every such case, the Principal acknowledges that
         EDC shall be entitled to exercise any such rights. EDC agrees to
         provide written notice to the Principal contemporaneously with any
         written notice provided to any Beneficiary under this Section 8;
         provided that failure to give any such notice to the Principal shall
         not affect EDC's ability to terminate or suspend any such EDC Support
         Agreement in the circumstances described in this Section 8.
