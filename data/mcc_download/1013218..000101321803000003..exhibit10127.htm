has all requisite power and authority under the laws of such State and its
charter, by-laws and other documents to own its property and assets, to enter
into and perform its obligations as such under the Loan Documents to which it is
a party, and to transact the business in which it is engaged or presently
proposes to engage. Borrower is duly qualified to transact business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
or to be conducted by it or the ownership of properties owned by it requires
such qualification, including, without limitation, the jurisdictions in which
the Property is located.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Action of
Borrower</B></U>. Borrower has taken all necessary action under its charter,
by-laws and other documents to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and each such Loan Document
constitutes the valid and binding obligation and agreement of Borrower,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors, and moratorium laws from time to time in
effect, and except to the extent that the availability of equitable relief may
be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
might be brought.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>No Violations of
Other Agreements, Etc.</B></U> Neither the execution and delivery of any of the
Loan Documents by Borrower, nor compliance by Borrower with the terms and
provisions hereof or thereof, are events which of themselves, or with the giving
of notice or the passage of time, or both, could constitute, on the part of
Borrower, a violation of, or conflict with, or result in any breach of, or
default under, the terms, conditions or provisions of any other agreement,
instrument or understanding to which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower or
the Property are bound, or require any consent, permit, approval, authorization,
declaration or filing under or pursuant to, any statute, law, judgment, decree,
order, rule or regulation applicable to Borrower, or result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon the
Property or any portion thereof or interest therein (other than the liens
created by the Security Agreements) or any other property or assets of Borrower
pursuant to the terms of any other indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, note,
evidence of indebtedness, agreement or other instrument to which Borrower may be
a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, or violate any
provisions of law, or any applicable order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree
of any court, or any order or other public regulation of any governmental

material litigation or proceeding is, to the best of the knowledge, information
and belief of Borrower, threatened against Borrower or against any of its
properties and, to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of
Borrower, no investigation looking toward such a proceeding has begun or is

exclude Borrower and their respective successors or assigns, and their partners,

portion of the Property. If two or more persons or entities are named as
Borrower herein, each of such persons or entities shall be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations of Borrower hereunder, and Lender may proceed against
any one without first having commenced proceedings against any other of them.
