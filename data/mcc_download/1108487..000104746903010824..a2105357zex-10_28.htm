Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Company and Employee hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of this Agreement (the "Term") begins on the date hereof, and terminates on the date three
(3)&nbsp;years from the date hereof, unless sooner terminated by either party as hereinafter provided. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee shall serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company and in such
capacity shall perform the functions and jobs described on Exhibit&nbsp;A and shall report directly to the Board of Directors of the Company. For as long as and during such period in which Employee
is serving as the CEO of the Company, the Company shall cause Employee to be nominated, and, if elected by the Company's shareholders, Employee shall also serve as a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, without additional compensation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Efforts.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of his employment, Employee shall devote his best efforts and such time and
attention as shall be necessary to promote the business and affairs of the Company and its
affiliated companies, as such business and affairs now exist or hereafter may be changed or supplemented, and shall, during the term of his employment hereunder, be engaged in other business
activities only to the extent that such activities do not interfere or conflict with his obligations to the Company hereunder, including, without limitation, obligations pursuant to the Noncompetition
and Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 below. The foregoing shall not be construed as preventing Employee from investing his assets in such form or manner as will not
require any significant services on his part in the operation of the affairs of the businesses or entities in which such investments are made; provided, however, that Employee shall not invest in any
business competitive with the Company, except that Employee shall be permitted to own not more than 5% of the stock of those companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or
on the NASDAQ system. The Company agrees that it will not require Employee to relocate his principal residence during the period of his employment hereunder, unless mutually agreed by both parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT

annual gross salary of Two Hundred Thirty-One Thousand Five Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars ($231,525) for the first year of the term hereof. This amount shall be increased by a
minimum of 5% for each subsequent year, provided that any percentage increase greater than 5% shall be determined in the sole discretion of the disinterested members of the Company's Board of
Directors. The salary will be paid in accordance with the Company's existing payroll policies, and shall be subject to applicable withholding taxes. Employee will also be eligible for payments from
the Company in respect of bonuses in amounts and at such times as determined in the sole discretion of the disinterested members of the Company's Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will reimburse Employee for all necessary and reasonable travel, entertainment and
other business expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties hereunder, upon receipt of a signed itemized list of such expenditures with appropriate backup documentation, or in accordance

incurred by Employee pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Without Cause.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also may terminate Employee's employment without Cause at any time upon written
notice, but, in that event, must pay to Employee a single lump sum in cash, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days, unless another date is mutually agreed upon by the parties, equal to one (1)&nbsp;year's
salary, plus all unreimbursed expenses incurred by Employee pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 above. All health, life insurance, long term disability, dental, and medical programs specified in
Section&nbsp;4 shall continue for one (1)&nbsp;year as if Employee had not been terminated. At the conclusion of that year, Employee shall be entitled to receive all accrued benefits then owed or
unless pursuant to the Company's plan or program an additional benefit is accrued and owed in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event payment is due to Employee under this Section
within twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months following a Change of Control, or if Employee is terminated without Cause or terminates for Good Reason within six (6)&nbsp;months prior to a Change
of Control and it is reasonably demonstrated by Employee that such termination or circumstances constituting Good Reason (i)&nbsp;were the result of the request of a third party who has taken steps
reasonably calculated to effect the Change of Control or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change of Control, then in lieu of the amounts specified in the first
two sentences, Employee shall receive a lump sum in cash within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date of termination equal to 2.99 multiplied by the sum of Employee's annual gross salary and bonus
for the year in which the Change of Control occurs or the immediately preceding year, whichever produces the higher sum. For the remainder of what would have been the Term, or at least twelve
(12)&nbsp;months, the Company shall continue health, life insurance, long term disability, dental, and medical program benefits for Employee and/or Employee's family at least equal to those which
would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section&nbsp;4 of this Agreement if Employee's employment had not been terminated. </FONT></P>

may terminate his employment hereunder in the event of "Good Reason" after thirty (30)&nbsp;days' written notice from Employee to the Board of Directors of

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than any Company employee stock ownership plan or an equivalent retirement plan, becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is used in
Section&nbsp;13(d) of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 40% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting
securities, (ii)&nbsp;the members of the Board of Directors on the date of this Agreement cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors (as defined below), (iii)&nbsp;the consummation of
a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or a liquidation (as measured by the fair value of the assets being sold compared to the fair value of all of the Company's assets), or
(iv)&nbsp;a merger or other combination occurs such that a majority of the equity securities of the resultant entity after the transaction are not owned by those who owned a majority of the equity

it is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company of benefits provided under this Agreement or any other benefits due upon a Change of Control (the
"Change of Control Benefits") would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of section&nbsp;280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), that would be
subject to an excise tax under section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax") the following provisions shall apply, unless provided otherwise in the applicable plan, program or agreement that
provides change of control payments that are not paid pursuant to this Agreement. If the aggregate present value to Employee of receiving the Change of Control Benefits and paying the Excise Tax is
not greater than the aggregate present value to Employee of the Change of Control Benefits reduced to the safe harbor amount (as defined below), then the Company shall reduce those Change of Control
Benefits specified by Employee such that the aggregate present value to Employee of receiving the Change of Control Benefits is equal to the safe harbor amount. Otherwise Employee shall receive the
full amount of the Change of Control Benefits and Employee shall be responsible for payment of the Excise Tax. For purposes of this paragraph "present value" shall be determined in accordance with
Section&nbsp;280G(d)(4) of the Code and the term "safe harbor amount" shall mean an amount expressed in the present value that maximizes the aggregate present value of the Change of Control Benefits
without causing any of the Change of Control Benefits to be subject to the deduction limitations set forth in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. </FONT></P>

determinations made pursuant to the foregoing paragraph shall be made by the Company's independent public accountant immediately prior to the Change of Control (the
"Accounting Firm"), which firm shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations both to the Company and to Employee within ten (10)&nbsp;days of the termination date. Any such
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Employee and the Company. Employee shall then, in Employee's sole discretion, determine which and how much of the Change of Control Benefits
shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of the foregoing subsection. All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in performing the determinations referred to above
shall be borne solely by the Company. </FONT></P>

Disputes of the American Arbitration Association; provided, that nothing in this Section shall be construed as precluding the Company from bringing an action for injunctive or other equitable relief.
The Company may elect to proceed to court without first resorting to arbitration in the event that Employee breaches any provision of the Noncompetition and Confidentiality Agreement. It is the intent
of the Company that, following a Change of Control, Employee not be required to incur any expenses associated with the enforcement of his rights under this Agreement by arbitration, litigation or
other legal action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to Employee hereunder. Accordingly, the Company shall pay Employee on

under this Section following a Change of Control. </FONT></P>
