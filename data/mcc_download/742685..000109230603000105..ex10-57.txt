                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.57


              SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED GRAPE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         This  SECOND  AMENDED  AND  RESTATED  GRAPE  PURCHASE   AGREEMENT  (the
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of this ____ day of June,  2002, by and
between PARAGON VINEYARD CO., INC. ("Grower"), and EDNA VALLEY VINEYARD, a Joint
Venture ("Buyer").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Grower is a Nevada corporation  operating  vineyards in Edna Valley,
San Luis Obispo, California.

         B. Buyer is a joint  venture  between  The Chalone  Wine Group Ltd.,  a
California  corporation,  and  Grower  (the  "Joint  Venture"),   organized  and
operating under that certain Joint Venture Agreement dated as of January 1, 1991
(the "1991 Joint  Venture  Agreement").  The 1991 Joint  Venture  Agreement  was
amended as of December 27, 1996 (the "First Amendment"), and was further amended
concurrently  with the  execution  of this  Agreement  as of June __,  2002 (the
"Second Amendment").  The 1991 Joint Venture Agreement,  as amended by the First
Amendment, and as amended by the Second Amendment, is referred to hereinafter as
the "Joint Venture  Agreement." The purpose of the Joint Venture is to operate a
winery as described in the Joint Venture Agreement.

         C. On January 1, 1991,  Grower and Buyer  entered into a Revised  Grape
Purchase  Agreement  with respect to the sale and  purchase of premium  varietal
wine grapes  exclusively  from vineyards  owned or leased by Grower (or Grower's
successor  pursuant to Article XI of the Joint Venture Agreement) to be produced
at Grower's  vineyards (the "Vineyards") in Edna Valley, San Luis Obispo County,
California  (the "1991  Grape  Purchase  Agreement").  The 1991  Grape  Purchase
Agreement was amended and restated on January 1, 1997 (the "1997 Grape  Purchase
Agreement").  The 1997 Grape Purchase  Agreement was amended as of March 1, 1998
(the "1998 Grape Purchase  Agreement").  The 1997 Grape Purchase  Agreement,  as
amended by the 1998 Grape Purchase Agreement,  is referred to hereinafter as the
"Existing  Agreement."  The  parties  hereto now wish to amend and  restate  the


                                       1


<PAGE>


Existing  Agreement  to provide for the  purchase and sale of such grapes on the
terms and conditions as set forth hereinafter.

                                    AGREEMENT

         1.       TERM:  This contract shall terminate upon the earlier of:

         (a) The dissolution of Buyer, unless the business of Buyer is continued
following such dissolution by one or more of the former Joint Venture  partners;
or

         (b) Upon the  transfer  by  Grower of all of its  Chardonnay  producing
vineyards in the manner provided in Article XI of the Joint Venture Agreement.

         In the event the periods  described  at (a) and (b) above are in excess
of the maximum term permitted under California or any other applicable law, then
the term of this  Agreement  shall be the  maximum  which is lawful  under  such
California or other applicable law.

         2.       QUANTITY:

         (a) All grapes purchased by the Buyer to be vinted by the Joint Venture
shall be purchased from Grower (or Grower's  successor pursuant to Article XI of
the Joint Venture  Agreement)  except as provided in section  2(c)(iii) below or
otherwise provided in writing by the parties.

         (b) All grape  purchase  contracts  with a vineyard  other than  Grower
shall be terminated as soon as practicable  and shall not be renewed or extended
without the prior written consent of Grower.

         (c) Grower shall sell and Buyer shall  purchase  grapes as  hereinafter
set forth:

             (i)      The annual tonnage by varietal to be purchased is as set
forth on EXHIBIT A.

             (ii)     In any year in which there is an excess crop of Chardonnay
grapes in order to  relieve  Grower  of undue  pressure  caused by over  supply,
Grower  shall have the right to  deliver,  and Buyer shall  purchase,  up to ten
percent  (10%) of the  annual  tonnage  stated  for each  varietal  of grapes on
EXHIBIT A.

             (iii) In the event that it appears that Grower's grape crop for any
varietal  is short and Grower  will  therefore  be unable to deliver  the stated
annual  tonnage  for any of the  varietal  grapes as  provided  for  under  this


                                       2


<PAGE>


Agreement and Buyer  notifies  Grower of the need to cover the short fall,  both
Grower and Buyer shall have the right to propose  sources of grapes to cover the
anticipated  short  fall for that  year's  harvest.  If Grower is  proposing  to
provide the grapes to cover,  Buyer has the right to a reasonable  review and to
reject the proposed purchase of grapes based upon quality, price or appellation.
If Buyer is proposing to source the grapes to cover, Buyer shall not contract to
purchase such grapes without the consultation and prior approval of Grower which
may not be unreasonably withheld.

         All grapes  purchased  for the  purpose of covering a short crop may be
used in a blend  and the wine  produced  therefrom  may be sold  under  the Edna
Valley  Vineyard  brand  provided  it is lawful to do so and such sale shall not
constitute a breach or violation of this Agreement, the Joint Venture Agreement,
the Revised License Agreement between the parties dated as of December 23, 1996,
or any other Agreement between the parties.

             (iv) No grapes purchased to cover a short fall may be processed at
the  Buyer's  Winery  if the  grapes  come  from a region  known  or  reasonably
suspected to be infested with phylloxera, the glassy winged sharpshooteror other
serious  disease or pest  although the juice from such  grapes,  if crushed at a
facility other than the Winery may be used in a blend.

             (v) The obligation to Grower to use its best reasonable efforts to
supply Buyer with grapes shall be subject to Grower's  obligations  to customers
other  than Buyer (as said  customers  may be  replaced  by new  customers  from
time-to-time).  By  way of  illustration  and  not  limitation,  should  weather
conditions or other  circumstances  limit the harvest in any one year,  then the
grapes  sold to Buyer by Grower  shall be reduced  pro rata  based upon  Buyer's
share of the year's projected harvest, as determined in good faith by Grower. It
is agreed  that  because  of the fact that  different  customers  of Grower  may
purchase  grapes for  delivery at different  times during the harvest,  any good
faith  allocation  made by Grower of its harvest among its customers on or prior
to September 1st of each year, shall be binding and conclusive upon Buyer.

         3.       BASE PURCHASE PRICE:

         (a) The base  purchase  price of grapes sold and  purchased  under this
Agreement for the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 will be as follows:

<TABLE>

         Chardonnay                         $2,325/ton        $2,372/ton        $2,419/ton       $2,467/ton
         Pinot Gris                         $1,800/ton        $1,836/ton        $1,873/ton       $1,910/ton
         Viognier                           $1,800/ton        $1,836/ton        $1,873/ton       $1,910/ton
         Sauvignon Blanc                    $1,300/ton        $1,326/ton        $1,353/ton       $1,380/ton
         Pinot Noir                         $2,800/ton        $2,856/ton        $2,913/ton       $2,971/ton
         Syrah(Catharine's Paso Robles)     $1,500/ton        $1,530/ton        $1,561/ton       $1,592/ton
         Syrah (Paragon)                    $1,800/ton        $1,836/ton        $1,873/ton       $1,910/ton
</TABLE>


         (b) For the year 2006 and  beyond,  the current  year's  price for each
individual  varietal  will be  calculated  by adjusting  the prior year's actual
price by a factor which has been  calculated  using the weighted  average of the
top  twenty-five  percent  (25%) of sales (as  determined by price per ton) with
Table 8  District  8 and the  most  recent  Grape  Crush  Report  (for  the year
immediately  preceding  the  current  harvest)  as the  numerator  and using the
weighted average of the top twenty-five percent (25%) of sales (as determined by
price per ton) and Table 8  District  8 from the  second  year (two  years  ago)
immediately  preceding  the most recent Grape Crush Report as the  denominator..
Changes can be either  positive or  negative,  but will not be more than $100.00
per ton per varietal in any year. In no case will the grape price drop below the
2002 price as stated in Section3(a).

         The following is an example of how this calculation is to be made:

             In order to calculate the price for the harvest of 2006:

                       Assume the actual price for the 2005 harvest was $2,000
                       per ton

                                       and

                       Assume the weighted average of the top 25%
                       for this varietal for the prior year's
                       harvest (2005) as reported in the Grape
                       Crush Report, Table 8, for the 2005 harvest
                       (which was published in March of 2006) was
                       $1,800

                                       and

                       Assume the weighted average of the top 25%
                       for this varietal for the harvest of two
                       years prior (2004) as reported in the Grape
                       Crush Report, Table 8, for the 2004 harvest
                       (which was published in March of 2005) was
                       $1,750


                                       4


<PAGE>


                       Prior year's (2005) top 25%        $1,800 (numerator)
                       Year before that (2004)            $1,750 (denominator)

                       Index would be                     102.86%

                       Times last year's (2005) price
                       of $2,000                          $2,057.14
                                                          =========
                                                          This becomes the
                                                          price for 2006

         The Grape Crush Report is the final Grape Crush Report published by the
California  Department of Food & Agriculture relating to the year of the harvest
(the Grape Crush Report).

         (c) The  prices  as  stated  in  Section  3(a)  will  not  apply to the
Schiebelhut  Chardonnay.  The  Schiebelhut  Chardonnay  price is determined by a
separate  written  agreement  which expires after the 2002 harvest.  The parties
will  jointly  monitor  the  contract  to  ensure  the  appropriate   notice  of
termination is given to Schiebelhut.

         (d) In the event the Grape Crush Report should cease to be published or
in the event the  parties  mutually  agree that the sales  reported to the Grape
Crush  Report do not,  in general,  reflect  arms  length  transactions  and the
formula is materially affected by the non-arms length transactions,  the parties
shall agree to another  pricing  method  which when applied will result in grape
pricing which will result in fixing prices in  substantially  the same manner or
in a reasonably  similar manner. If the parties are unable to agree upon another
method the issue shall be  mediated  or  arbitrated  pursuant  to  paragraph  12
hereof.

         4.       BONUSES AND PENALTIES:

         (a) The base  purchase  price  determined  as set forth in  paragraph 3
above shall be paid for grapes  delivered  with a brix  between 22.5 degrees and
24.5  degrees.  There  shall be a bonus  paid for  grapes  delivered  at a sugar
content above 24.5 degrees (or in certain  circumstances  above 24 degrees brix)
to a maximum of 27 degrees brix, and a penalty for grapes  delivered  below 22.5
degrees brix.  The bonus or penalty as  applicable  shall be one percent (1%) of


                                       5


<PAGE>


the base price for each one-tenth degree  (1/10(degree)) above 24.5 degrees to a
maximum  of 27  degrees,  or below  22.5  degrees  to a maximum  of 21  degrees.
Provided,  however,  in the event 40% or more of the total  tonnage  under  this
Agreement  in a given  vintage as  determined  per  varietal is not called in by
Buyer at press  tank  zone  sugars  of 23.5  degrees  brix or  below  the  bonus
threshold shall be reduced from 24.5 degrees to 24.0 degrees brix for the entire
harvest.

         The optimum sugar is 23.5 degrees brix.

         From time to time  Buyer may call for  delivery  of up to five  percent
(5%) of the fruit in a vintage under 22.5 degree brix and such delivery shall be
without penalty.

         (b) All bonuses,  penalties or rejection shall be computed on the basis
of the weighted  average sugar content.  The content shall be measured daily and
the bonus,  penalty or rejection  shall be computed on a day of delivery  basis.
The method of  calculation  of the weighted  average  sugar  content shall be as
depicted in EXHIBIT B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The
sugar content shall be determined by  refractometer.  The determination of sugar
content  shall be made by Buyer and reported to Grower within  twenty-four  (24)
hours of each day's  delivery.  The sugar  content  shall be  determined by zone
press tank samples  taken at the  conclusion  of a day's  pressing or as soon as
reasonably  practicable  thereafter.  The results of a zone tank sample analysis
shall be  communicated  by fax to Grower  within two hours of taking the sample.
Grower has the right at any time to take its own  samples  or to compare  sample
results with Buyer's  laboratory  in order to confirm the accuracy of any sample
testing.

         (c) If the  weighted  average  sugar  content is below 21 degrees or 27
degrees, the grapes may be rejected.

         5.       CONDITION  OF DELIVERED  GRAPES.

         All grapes  delivered  under this  contract  shall be delivered  with a
minimum of Material Other Than Grapes ("MOG"), Defects and Rot.


                                       6


<PAGE>


         (a) Each  grape  delivery  shall be  visually  inspected  by Buyer  for
Defects,  Rot and  MOG.  In the  event  Buyer  determines  that a load  contains
Defects,  Rot or MOG  justifying  a  rejection  of the load and Grower  does not
acquiesce  in the  determination,  the  load  shall  be  referred  to the  Grape
Inspection  Service of the California  Department of Food & Agriculture  for the
purpose of making an inspection and a conclusive  determination  as to the level
of Defects.

         (b)  Defects  is  defined  in  accordance  with the custom of the grape
industry  and the  practice of the Grape  Inspection  Service of the  California
Department of Food & Agriculture and shall include grapes with mold,  raisining,
sunburn, ambering, stress or waterberry conditions, mildew and rot (except Noble
Rot in the case of  Chardonnay)  if such defects amount to three percent (3%) or
more of the load.

         A load of  Chardonnay  grapes  infected  with  Noble  Rot  shall not be
considered  unacceptable  if it  contains  Noble  Rot in an  amount of less than
fifteen percent (15%). Any greater amount shall render the load unacceptable.

         For the purposes of making the  determination  as to the type of rot, a
distinction  must be made  between gray rot and Noble Rot. As defined by Richard
Smart,  the malevolent form of Botrytis is known as gray rot, the most common of
all bunch rots.  It is typified by rapid growth under moist  conditions.  On the
other hand if it affects ripe, healthy whole lightskinned grapes and the weather
and conditions are favorable,  Botrytis  develops into a benevolent  form called
Noble Rot ("Noble Rot").

         Each load of grapes  delivered  having  more than  three  percent  (3%)
Defects,  or, for  Chardonnay,  more than fifteen percent (15%) Noble Rot may be
rejected by Buyer  subject to  confirmation  of  rejection  by State  inspection
unless Grower acquiesces with Buyer's rejection.

         (c) MOG shall be  defined  in  accordance  with the custom of the grape
industry  and the  practice of the Grape  Inspection  Service of the  California
Department of Food & Agriculture and shall include leaves, leaf stems, canes and
any other materials foreign to grapes. Each load of grapes delivered having more


                                       7


<PAGE>


than three percent (3%) MOG will be considered  unacceptable and may be rejected
by Buyer subject to confirmation of rejection by State inspection  unless Grower
acquiesces with Buyer's rejection.

         (d) Any inspection by the State inspectors shall be made within six (6)
hours of the time of delivery of the load. The party seeking a determination  of
excess Defects, Rot or MOG shall order and pay the cost of the State inspection.

         Grower  shall be notified  immediately  upon any  determination  by the
State inspector  concluding  that a grape delivery has Defects,  Rot or MOG at a
level justifying  rejection.  Grower at its expense has the right to require the
State  inspector  to  make a  second  determination.  The  average  of  the  two
inspections shall control.

         In the event a load of grapes is rejected by Buyer and the rejection is
upheld  by the  State  inspector,  Grower  has the  right at its sole  option to
require Buyer to process the grapes into wine.  The cost of processing  shall be
borne by Grower.  The price for such services shall be not greater than would be
the  price  from  Courtside  Cellars  or if it is no  longer  in  business  as a
processor of third party grapes,  then a similar type of winery  mutually agreed
to by the  parties.  The wine shall at all times be owned by and  subject to the
disposition of Grower.

         If  there  is  any   determination   by  the  Federal   Food  and  Drug
Administration,  the  California  Department  of  Public  Health,  or any  other
governmental  agencies  that any lot or  portion of any lot of grapes are not in
compliance  with the law or the quality  standards set forth in this  Agreement,
Buyer shall have the right not to accept such grapes.

         Rejection of grapes pursuant to this Section 5 shall not relieve Grower
from the obligation to deliver the tonnage required under this Agreement.

         The results of field  inspections  or  walkthroughs  by Buyer shall not
bind Buyer to accept grapes.

         6.       TIME OF HARVEST:

         Grower shall keep Buyer advised of sugar  development and shall provide
grape  samples so that Buyer can  determine  acid and sugar  levels.  Grower and
Buyer jointly shall determine the approximate time of harvest, taking into


                                       8


<PAGE>

consideration the condition of the fruit, weather forecasts, Grower's ability to
harvest the fruit, and Buyer's ability to receive the fruit.

         The  parties  shall  cooperate  with each  other in fixing the time and
quantity of grapes to be delivered.

         Grower may request at any time, upon reasonable  notice, the press crew
to provide press sugar levels based upon refractometer  samples taken from press
loads. The exact manner and number of such tests shall be as reasonably  agreed.
Such  information  shall be  passed  from the  press  crew to  Grower as soon as
practicable.  Nothing in this  subparagraph  is  intended to prevent the parties
from  establishing a fixed discipline which provides the Grower with information
about press run sugars.

         7.       DELIVERY:

         (a) Grapes shall be delivered at Grower's  expense to Buyer's  crushing
platform in two (2) ton  gondolas or such other  conveyance  as may from time to
time be mutually agreed.  Daily delivery  quantities and times of delivery shall
be agreed upon in advance by the  parties.  Risk of loss shall pass to the Buyer
upon delivery to Buyer's premises.

         (b) The grapes from Edna Valley will be hand-harvested unless otherwise
agreed by the  parties.  The grapes from Paso  Robles will be machine  harvested
unless  otherwise  agreed by the parties.  In  considering  the issue of machine
harvesting,  the parties  shall weigh  issues of  weather,  available  labor and
burdens on the Winery and the Grower.

         8.       METHOD OF  DETERMINING  WEIGHT:

         The weight for each load of grapes  shall be the  weights  recorded  on
Grower's  "Gondola  Tickets."  Grower  shall have the crane  scale and the truck
scale located at Orcutt Road Cellars which may be utilized to weigh the gondolas
inspected and sealed by the State of  California  Bureau of Weights and Measures
prior to each year's harvest.

         9.       PAYMENT AND REPORTING:

         (a) Buyer will receive a summary from Grower of the total tonnage
delivered (by varietal) during the previous two-week time period of harvest.
Buyer will continue to receive a summary for every subsequent two-week period of
harvest until harvest is completed.


                                       9


<PAGE>


         (b) Buyer  will make  estimated  grape  payments  to  Grower,  for each
two-week  summary  received thirty (30) days after the last day of each two-week
period. Payments will be trued-up after the completion of the harvest.

         10.      VITICULTURAL PRACTICES:

         Grower shall use viticultural  practices  intended to produce grapes of
the same or similar  quality as heretofore  delivered by Grower to Buyer,  under
the previous grape purchase  agreement between the parties.  Representatives  of
Buyer  shall  have the right to enter into and  inspect  Grower's  vineyards  at
reasonable times and may call Grower's  attention to any conditions or practices
which in Buyer's representatives'  judgment may prevent the grapes from reaching
maturity or proper  quality.  All  responsibility  for grape  quality rests with
Grower  and  Grower  retains  final  authority  with  respect  to  all  cultural
practices.

percent (1%) of the vintage or one hundred fifty (150) cases of wine,  whichever

         12.      MEDIATION OR ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.

         All disputes  between the parties arising under this Agreement shall be
resolved  by first,  nonbinding  mediation  and  failing  successful  mediation,
binding  arbitration  as provided in Article 18 of the Joint  Venture  Agreement
between the parties, which Article is incorporated herein by reference.

         13.      CONTINUATION OF PERFORMANCE DURING DISPUTE:

         Unless the nature of a breach or dispute physically  precludes the sale
or vinting of grapes,  the  parties  shall  continue  to provide and take grapes
under the terms of this Agreement during any dispute. The continuing  obligation
to  provide  and  take  grapes  shall,   if  appropriate  and  relevant  to  the
arbitration, be determined by the arbitration.

         14.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT:

         (a) Breach of any material  term of this  Agreement,  if such breach is
not cured  within  thirty (30) days after  written  notice has been given to the
breaching party.

         (b)  Breach  of a term  of the  Joint  Venture  Agreement  which  has a
material  effect on the parties'  rights and  obligations  under this Agreement,
unless  the breach is cured as  provided  in such  Agreement.  For  purposes  of
paragraph 15 hereof,  the terms  "non-defaulting  party" and "defaulting  party"
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Joint Venture Agreement.

         (c) A rejection of a delivery or multiple  deliveries of grapes because
of a failure to meet  quality  criteria  as  provided  in  Paragraph 5 shall not
constitute  an event of default under this  Agreement.  An inability to complete
the order because of a rejection of a delivery or multiple  deliveries is not an
event of default under this Agreement.

         15.      REMEDIES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT:

         The parties shall have the following  remedies in the event of default.
These  remedies  are not  exclusive;  they are  cumulative,  in  addition to any
remedies now or later allowed by law or under contract.


                                       11

         (a) The  non-defaulting  party may elect to continue this  Agreement in
full force and effect.  Such an  election  does not  constitute  a waiver of any
future or continuing default.

         (b) The  non-defaulting  party may terminate this Agreement and, if the
defaulting party is Grower,  Buyer may thereafter  purchase grapes for the Joint
Venture from other sources, free of further obligations under this Agreement and
any provision of any other agreement  between the parties requiring the purchase
of grapes from Grower's vineyards.

         (c) Either  party may require a default to be the subject of  mediation
and binding arbitration under the procedures provided for in paragraph 12.

         16.      FORCE MAJEURE:

         (a) In the  event  the  business  of  either  party is  interrupted  or
interfered with by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable  control including,
but not limited to, fire, flood, storm, earthquake,  explosion,  war, rebellion,
insurrection,  quarantine,  an act of God,  disease,  weather,  lack  of  water,
boycott, embargo, strike, riot, or any governmental law, directive or regulation
affecting any part of such party's business, then that party shall at its option
be  excused  for the  duration  of the  intervention  or  interference  from its
performance  under this Agreement with respect to any or all of the grapes which
are affected by such cause and which are thereby undelivered or unaccepted.  The
foregoing  option may be exercised by prompt  written  notice given to the other
party.  Similar prompt  written notice shall be given of the  termination of the
event of force majeure.

         17.      ASSIGNMENT:

         Neither party may assign this Agreement  without the written consent of
the other party. However,  Grower may assign its right to receive payments under
this Agreement and may grant a security  interest in growing crops which include
grapes to be purchased by Buyer.  Upon written request from Grower,  Buyer shall
make specified payments directly to a secured

pursuant  to this  paragraph  17,  with the right to cure any  default of Grower
thereunder to the extent necessary to protect Buyer's purchase rights hereunder,
for Grower's accont and at Grower's expense.

         18.      MODIFICATION OR AMENDMENT:

         This Agreement may not be  supplemented,  modified,  altered or amended
except by a written agreement executed by the patties hereto.

         19.      GOVERNING LAW:

marketing order or agreement issued under authority of any state or federal law.

         22.      SUCCESSORS:

         Subject to the  limitation  on  assignment  described in paragraph  17,
above,  this  Agreement  shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the successors and assigns of the respective parties hereto.

         This Second  Amended and Restated Grape  Purchase  Agreement  effective
