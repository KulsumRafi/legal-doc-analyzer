               The first delivery to VIVUS in 2003 will consist of [*] from each
               of the [*] of Product manufactured by CHINOIN with the modified
               process as described in Section 2.4.1 of this Amendment Three.
               The second delivery may contain further quantities of these [*]
               still on stock at CHINOIN at the time of shipment or from further
                [*] or [*]   manufactured with the same modified process of

               of [*] below [*].

     2.7.2.    Parties agree that the obligation of VIVUS to take the [*]

               NDA of MUSE as set forth in Section 2.6.2 of this Amendment
               Three.
<PAGE>

     2.7.3.    Within five (5) working days after execution of this Amendment
               Three, VIVUS agrees to issue a Purchase Order for the delivery of
               [*] of Product with reference to conditions stipulated in this
               Amendment Three.

     2.7.4.    VIVUS will place with CHINOIN [*] of its orders for the Product
               (based on mass) until VIVUS accepts delivery from CHINOIN the [*]
               of the Product referred to in Section 2.7.1. In no event will
               CHINOIN be obligated to supply more than [*] of Product in the
               seventh Agreement Year.

     2.7.5.    From the eighth Agreement Year of this Amendment Three onward,
               VIVUS agrees to place not less than [*] of its orders for the
               Product (based on mass) from CHINOIN after having completed all
               of its purchasing obligations as detailed above in Sections 2.71,
               2.7.2, 2.7.3 and 2.7.2 of this Amendment Three. In no event will
               CHINOIN be obligated to supply more than [*] of Product annually.

     2.7.6.    Section 2.12 of the Agreement is hereby restated to read as
               follows:

               2.12 Minimum Quantities

               2.12.1    VIVUS agrees that the quantity of Product purchased
                         from CHINOIN shall in no event fall below the minimum
                         quantity of [*] in the eighth and ninth Agreement
                         Years. This undertaking is not subject to any waiver
                         due to decrease of the consumption of the Product.

               2.12.2    The Parties will negotiate the minimum purchasing
                         stipulations for the tenth, eleventh and twelfth
                         Agreement Years at the end of ninth Agreement Year.
                         Should the Parties fail to reach new minimum purchasing
                         stipulations at the end of ninth Agreement Year, the
                         purchasing stipulations valid in the ninth Agreement
                         Year shall remain in force for the tenth, eleventh and
                         twelfth Agreement Years.

     2.8 Non-fulfillment

     2.8.1.    In the event CHINOIN is unable to fulfil its obligations within
               three (3) months from the deadline indicated in Section 2.4.2 of
               this Amendment Three, VIVUS will have the right to place orders
               with other supplier(s) in quantities not exceeding the quantity
               scheduled for the time in question stipulated in Section 2.7.1 of
               this Amendment Three until the time CHINOIN completes the
               fulfillment of its referred obligations.

               Thereafter, VIVUS will place with CHINOIN [*] of its orders for
               the Product until the [*] stipulated in Section 2.7.1 is
               delivered in full.

               The delay of VIVUS taking deliveries of the [*] stipulated in
               Section 2.4.1 for any reason will create no right for either of
               the Parties to change the price of this [*] as stipulated for the
               seventh Agreement Year in Section 2.9 of this Amendment Three.

               VIVUS agrees that the measures to postpone taking delivery from
               CHINOIN and/or to order quantities from other suppliers
               proportionally as stipulated in Section 2.8.1 will satisfy in
               full any and all of CHINOIN's obligations and VIVUS will not be
               entitled to claim compensations or losses due to the above delay,
               if any.

     2.8.2.    Notwithstanding Section 2.7.2 of this Amendment Three, in the
               event VIVUS is unable to acquire the approval of its supplement
               to its NDA, as described in Section 2.6 of this Amendment Three,
               due to reasons
<PAGE>

               unquestionably not attributable to CHINOIN, VIVUS shall be
               obligated to take the [*] and pay their value in full.

               Parties agree that the lack of any question on the Product by the
               FDA during the Amendment approval procedure or the lack of
               reasons referring to the Product in a regulatory decision denying
               the approval are reasons unquestionably not attributable to
               CHINOIN without any further evidence in case of inability of
               VIVUS to acquire the approval in question.

     2.9 Section 2.7 of the Agreement as modified by Amendment One is hereby
amended in its entirety to read as follows:

               2.7       Price The price to be paid by VIVUS per gram of the
                         Product ordered by VIVUS shall be based upon the
                         quantities of the Product ordered by VIVUS for delivery
                         during the particular Agreement Year, as follows:

               2.7.1     Quantity Ordered for Delivery

                         During the seventh Agreement Year            U.S. $/[*]

                         All quantities up to [*]                       $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*], if any
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*], if any
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]

               2.7.2     Quantity Ordered for Delivery

                         During the eight and ninth Agreement Year    U.S. $/[*]
                         -----------------------------------------    ----------
                         First [*]
                         "Minimum Annual Quantity"                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*],
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*],
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*],
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*],
                         up to [*]                                      $[*]
                         Quantities in excess of [*], if any            $[*]

               2.7.3     The Parties will negotiate the price stipulations for
                         the tenth, eleventh and twelfth Agreement Years at the
                         end of ninth Agreement Year. Should the Parties fail to
                         reach new price stipulations at the end of ninth
                         Agreement Year, the price stipulations valid in the
                         ninth Agreement Year shall remain in force for the
                         tenth, eleventh and twelfth Agreement Years.

                         It is understood that the foregoing prices are based
                         upon the total cumulative quantities ordered by VIVUS
                         for delivery during the particular Agreement Year, and
                         not only on the size of the particular order or
                         delivery. It is also understood that the prices are for
                         the incremental quantities.
