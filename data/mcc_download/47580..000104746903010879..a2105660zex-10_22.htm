<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(g)
In the case of an Employee whose Compensation is determined on the basis of an hourly rate, the number of hours to be credited to the Employee in a Vesting Computation Period solely
for the purpose of determining Years of Vesting Service will be determined on the basis of Compensation, if: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
The Employee is credited with the number of hours equal to: the total of the Employee's Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period divided by the Employee's hourly rate as in
effect at such times during the Vesting Computation Period; or the Employee's total Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period divided by the Employee's lowest hourly rate during the Vesting
Computation Period, or by the lowest hourly rate payable to an Employee in the same or a similar job classification reasonably defined; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)

Employee's hourly rate of Compensation shall be the Employee's lowest rate of Compensation during a Vesting Computation Period for such specified period of time divided by the number of hours
regularly scheduled for the performance of duties during such period of time. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, in the case of an Employee without a regular work schedule, the Employee's hourly rate of Compensation shall be calculated on the basis of a 40-hour workweek or an 8-hour workday, or any
other reasonable basis which reflects the average hours worked by the Employee over a representative period of time, provided that the basis so used is consistently applied to all Employees within the
same job classifications reasonably defined. </FONT></P>

lowest hourly rate of Compensation payable to Employees in the same job classification as the Employee, or, if no Employees in the same job classification have an hourly rate, the minimum wage as
established from time to time under Section&nbsp;6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. </FONT></P>
