Shionogi as a royalty hereunder for sales of Therapeutic Product covered by a Valid Claim within the Shionogi Patent Rights in a currency other than United States dollars shall be as determined under the agreement between Scios and its Sublicensee.
In the case of sales made directly by Scios and its Affiliates, the amounts payable to Shionogi as a royalty hereunder for sales of Therapeutic Product covered by a Valid Claim within the Shionogi Patent Rights in a currency other than United States
dollars shall be determined by converting the total royalty on Net Sales for a calendar quarter (computed in the currency in which the sales were made) directly into United States dollars using the closing spot exchange rate between the two

negotiate in good faith other conversion mechanism. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV ALIGN="center">
