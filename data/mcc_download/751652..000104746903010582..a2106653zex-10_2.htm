SIZE=2><I>Paragraph&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Plan is to provide an incentive to officers and key employees of
Questar Corporation (the Company) for the accomplishment of major organizational and individual objectives designed to further the efficiency, profitability, and growth of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Paragraph&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Management Performance Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors
shall have full power and authority to interpret and administer the Plan. Such Committee shall consist of no less than three disinterested members of the Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Paragraph&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 60&nbsp;days after the beginning of each year, the Committee shall
nominate Participants from the officers and key employees for such year. The Committee shall also establish a target bonus for the year for each Participant expressed as a percentage of base salary or
specified portion of base salary. Participants shall be notified of their selection and their target bonus as soon as practicable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Paragraph&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of Performance Objectives.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 60&nbsp;days after the beginning of each
year, the Committee shall establish target, minimum, and maximum performance objectives for the Company and for its major operating subsidiaries and shall determine the manner in which the target
bonus is
allocated among the performance objectives. The Committee shall also recommend a dollar maximum for payments to Participants for any Plan year. The Board of Directors shall take action concerning the
recommended dollar maximum within 60&nbsp;days after the beginning of the Plan year. Participants shall be notified of the performance objectives as soon as practicable once such objectives have
been established. </FONT></P>

90&nbsp;days after the close of each year during which the Plan is in effect, the Committee shall compute incentive awards for eligible participants in such amounts as the members deem fair and
equitable, giving consideration to the degree to which the Participant's performance has contributed to the performance of the Company and its affiliated companies and using the target bonuses and
performance objectives previously specified. Aggregate awards calculated under the Plan shall not exceed the maximum limits approved by the Board of Directors for the year involved. To be eligible to
receive a payment, the Participant must be actively employed by the Company or an affiliate as of the date of distribution except as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;8 and must not have been placed on
probation during such year. </FONT></P>

the event a Participant ceases to be an employee during a year by reason of death, disability, approved retirement, an award, or a reduction in force, if any,
determined in accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;6 for the year of such event, shall be reduced to reflect partial participation by multiplying the award by a fraction equal to the months of
participation during the applicable year through the date of termination rounded up to whole months divided by 12. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the purpose of this Plan, approved retirement shall mean any termination of service on or after age 55 with 10&nbsp;years of service. For the purpose of this Plan, disability shall
mean any termination of service that results in payments under the Company's long-term disability plan. A reduction in force, for the purpose of this Plan, shall mean any involuntary
termination of employment due to the Company's economic condition, sale of assets, shift in focus, or other reasons independent of the Participant's performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
entire amount of any award that is determined after the death of a Participant shall be paid in accordance with the terms of Paragraph&nbsp;11. </FONT></P>

his final paycheck or in accordance with the terms of elections to voluntarily defer receipt of awards earned prior to February&nbsp;12, 1991, or deferred under the terms of the Company's Deferred
Compensation Plan. In the event of termination due to disability, approved retirement, or a reduction in force, any shares of common stock previously credited to a Participant shall be distributed
free of restrictions during the last month of employment. The current market value (defined as the closing price for the stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date in question) of such shares
shall be included in the Participant's final paycheck. Such Participant shall be paid the full amount of any award (adjusted for partial participation) declared subsequent to the date of such
termination within 30&nbsp;days of the date of declaration. Any partial payments shall be made in cash. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event a Participant ceases to be an employee during a year by reason of a change in control, he shall be entitled to receive all amounts deferred by him prior to
February&nbsp;12, 1991, and all undistributed portions for prior Plan years. He shall also be entitled to an award for the year of such event as if he had been an employee throughout such year. The
entire amount of any award for such
year shall be paid in a lump sum within 60&nbsp;days after the end of the year in question. Such amounts shall be paid in cash. </FONT></P>

Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred if (i)&nbsp;any "Acquiring Person" (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement dated as of February&nbsp;13,
1996, between the Company and U. S. Bank, National Association ("Rights Agreement")) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is used in Rule&nbsp;13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) of securities of the Company representing 25&nbsp;percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company; or (ii)&nbsp;the following individuals cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, as of May&nbsp;19, 1998, constitute the Company's Board of Directors ("Board") and any new director (other than a
director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors
of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
directors then still in office who either were directors on May&nbsp;19, 1998, or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

consolidation that would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior </FONT></P>

60&nbsp;percent of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or a merger or
consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no person is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company representing 25&nbsp;percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or (iv)&nbsp;the Company's stockholders approve a plan of complete
liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or
disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an entity, at least 60&nbsp;percent of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by
stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale. A Change in Control, however, shall not be considered to have
occurred until all conditions precedent to the transaction, including but not limited to, all required regulatory approvals have been obtained. </FONT></P>

February&nbsp;12, 1991, shall be credited with interest from the date the payment was first available in cash to the date of actual payment. Such interest shall be calculated at a monthly rate using
the typical rates paid by major banks on new issues of negotiable Certificates of Deposit in the amounts of $1,000,000 or more for one year as quoted in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>The Wall Street

undistributed portions of prior awards shall become payable. Amounts previously deferred by the Participant, together with credited interest to the date of death, shall also become payable. Each
Participant shall designate a beneficiary to receive any amounts that become payable after death under this Paragraph or Paragraph&nbsp;8. In the event that no valid beneficiary designation exists
at death, all amounts due shall be paid as a lump sum to the estate of the Participant. Any shares of restricted stock previously credited to the Participant shall be distributed to the Participant's
beneficiary or, in the absence of a valid beneficiary designation, to the Participant's estate, at the same time any cash is paid. </FONT></P>

suspend, or terminate the Plan, but such action shall not affect the awards and the payment of such awards for any prior years. The Company's Board of Directors cannot terminate the Plan in any year
in which a change of control has occurred without the written consent of the Participants. The Plan shall be deemed suspended for any year for which the Board of Directors has not fixed a maximum
dollar amount available for awards. </FONT></P>

assignable or transferable in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, but not by way of limitation, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge,
bankruptcy, or in any other manner, and no right or interest of any Participant under the Plan shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of such Participant. Any assignment,
transfer, or other act in violation of this provision shall be void. </FONT></P>

Consequently, awards payable under the Plan do not constitute performance based compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended. Any portion of an award
otherwise payable under this Plan to a Participant who is listed in the compensation table of the Company's proxy statement will be deferred to the extent that the Company cannot take a tax </FONT></P>
