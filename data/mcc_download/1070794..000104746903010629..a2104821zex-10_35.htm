Section&nbsp;3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, prior to the last business day of the year preceding the Plan Year for which the election is to become effective (or such earlier date as the
Committee may in its sole discretion determine). Persons who first become Eligible Employees on or after January&nbsp;1, but before July&nbsp;1 of any Plan Year, may elect to defer Base
Compensation effective July&nbsp;1 of such Plan Year by filing with the Committee an election that conforms to the requirements of this Section&nbsp;3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no

Compensation effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2000 by filing with the Committee an election that conforms to the requirements of this Section&nbsp;3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later
than June&nbsp;30, 2000 (or such earlier date as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Eligible Employee shall be permitted to defer Base
Compensation which the Committee (or its delegate) reasonably determines is required to pay the Eligible Employee's portion of payroll taxes and contributions towards benefits provided to the Eligible

deferral election made under paragraph&nbsp;(a) of this Section&nbsp;3.1 shall remain in effect and be irrevocable, notwithstanding any change in the
Participant's Base Compensation, for the entire Plan Year for which it is effective. Subject to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.1, a Participant shall file&nbsp;a new election each year with
the Committee prior to the last business day of such year (or such earlier date as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine), for Base Compensation earned during the Plan Year beginning on
January&nbsp;1, of the immediately following year. </FONT></P>

reducing such Participant's Base Compensation deferral percentage for the remainder of the Plan Year to 0%. If such an election is made, the Participant shall make no further deferrals under this Plan
for that Plan Year. Such election shall be valid as soon as administratively feasible following its receipt by the Committee. For purposes of the foregoing, a financial hardship shall generally be
limited to a need for funds for any of the following purposes: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Funds are to be used only for purposes of determining the amount of

earnings and the crediting or debiting of such earnings to a Participant's Accounts shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her Accounts in any such Fund.
In the event that the Company or any trustee of a Trust described in Section&nbsp;6.6, in its sole discretion, decides to invest any amounts in any or all of the Funds, no Participant shall have any
rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Accounts shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his
