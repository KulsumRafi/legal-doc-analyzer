         (ii)     an officer's certificate from a senior executive of Lynx
                  representing and warranting that to the best of executive's
                  knowledge, as of the date of the accelerated payment of the
                  technology access fee or equity investment, that (x) Lynx

                  of the accelerated payment of the technology access fee or
                  equity investment, as the case may be, in substantially the
                  same manner as it was operated on the date of the accelerated
                  payment of the technology access fee or equity investment, (y)
                  Lynx estimates that it will be able to meet all financial
                  obligations as they fall due for a period of [ * ] following
                  the date of the accelerated payment of the technology access
                  or equity investment, as the case may be, without recourse to
                  equity or debt financing or additional capital increases, the
                  sole purpose of which is to meet Lynx' financial obligations,
                  and (z) Lynx has made available to Takara such public
                  financial and business records and documents as Takara has

                  Lynx' most recent audited financial statements.

7. In addition to the agreement changes noted above, Lynx will provide Takara
nonexclusive access to the [ * ] Tissue data sets as noted on Exhibit 1A to this
document. Takara may use the data to help market MPSS(TM) services allowing
customers to access the data, but Takara may not sell the data itself. Takara
may also mine the data for genes of its interest and profit from the sales of
those genes, provided a royalty arrangement between Takara and Lynx is put in
place.

Except as expressly provided herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect.

please execute the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to Lynx.
