<H1 align=center><FONT size=4>INTRODUCTION</FONT><BR><BR></H1>
<P align="justify">Ingersoll-Rand Company (the &quot;Company&quot;) established the Ingersoll-Rand Company
Employee Savings Plan (the &quot;Qualified Savings Plan&quot;) effective January 1, 2003
for employees employed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and affiliates of
the Company (the &quot;Employees&quot;), under which benefits are subject to various
limitations imposed by Sections 401 and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;), and under which benefits do not reflect
compensation of Employees deferred under the IR Executive Deferred Compensation
Plan (the &quot;Deferral Plan&quot;).</P>
<P align="justify">The purpose of this amended and restated Ingersoll-Rand Company Supplemental
Employee Savings Plan, which was formerly known as the Ingersoll-Rand Company
Supplemental Savings and Stock Investment Plan (the &quot;Supplemental Savings Plan&quot;)
is to provide a vehicle under which Employees can be paid benefits which are
supplemental to benefits payable under the Qualified Savings Plan that are
limited by operation of Sections 401 and 415 of the Code (or successor
provisions) and that do not include compensation deferred under the Deferral
Plan.</P>
<P align="justify">Effective August 1, 2002, the liabilities under the Ingersoll-Rand Company
Supplemental Retirement Account Plan (the &quot;Supplemental RAP&quot;) were merged into
this Supplemental Savings Plan.</P>
<P align="justify">It is intended that this Supplemental Savings Plan be treated as &quot;a plan
which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees&quot; within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended.</P>
<P align="justify">Unless otherwise indicated herein, capitalized terms shall have the same
meanings as they have under the Qualified Savings Plan.</P>
<P align="justify">This Supplemental Savings Plan, as amended and restated, shall be effective
January 1, 2003 with respect to all Employees except those Employees employed by
The Torrington Company.&nbsp; The provisions of this Supplemental Savings Plan
as in effect prior to January 1, 2003 shall continue to apply to Employees of
The Torrington Company.</P>

shall become eligible to participate under this Supplemental Savings Plan for a
calendar year as of the date on which his total Company Matching Contributions
for such year under the Qualified Savings Plan are less than such total Company
Matching Contributions would have been if the definition of Compensation
specified in the Qualified Savings Plan did not exclude (i) compensation in
excess of the limitation provided under Section 401(a)(l7) of the Code and/or
(ii) compensation deferred under the Deferral Plan.</P>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An

Compensation for the year exceeds the limitation provided under Section
401(a)(l7) of the Code and/or did not reflect compensation deferred under the
Deferral Plan.&nbsp; The amount of Supplemental Company Contributions credited
to the Employee Account of an Employee who is eligible to receive a benefit for
