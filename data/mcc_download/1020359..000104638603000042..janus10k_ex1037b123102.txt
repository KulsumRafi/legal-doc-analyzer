           (c) Any order, judgment or decree shall be entered, without Payor's
  application, approval or consent, by any court of competent jurisdiction,
  approving a petition seeking reorganization of Payor or of all or a
  substantial part of its assets, or appointing a receiver, custodian, trustee,
  intervenor or liquidator therefor, or such a petition seeking reorganization
  or liquidation shall be filed against Payor and such order, judgment or decree
  shall continue unstayed and in effect for a period of sixty (60) days.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, at the option of
Payee: (i) Payee may declare this Note immediately due and payable in full, as
to Principal, interest and any other sums payable hereunder, whereupon all such
sums shall be and become immediately due and payable in full; and (ii) Payee
shall be entitled to exercise forthwith against Payor any and all rights and
remedies that may otherwise be available to Payee hereunder and at law or in
equity.


         This Note, and any payments due hereon, shall be subordinate to Senior
Debt, now or hereafter existing, of Payor (as hereinafter defined). "Senior
Debt" shall mean and include the Principal of premium and interest on all (a)
indebtedness of Payor to its creditors other than Payee under this Note and
other than to any stockholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer or
employee of Payor, whether or not secured and whether heretofore or hereafter
incurred (i) for borrowed money whether Payor is liable directly or indirectly
by guarantee, letter of credit or otherwise (exclusive of indebtedness for
borrowed money secured by a mortgage on real property and which is otherwise
non-recourse to the assets of the Company) or (ii) in connection with the
acquisition or lease by Payor of assets, for the payment of which Payor is
liable directly or indirectly by guarantee, letter of credit, obligation to
purchase or acquire or otherwise and (b) renewal, extensions or deferrals of any
such indebtedness. In the event of the distribution of assets of Payor upon
liquidation, dissolution, or reorganization of Payor, then principal, interest,
or premium on Senior Debt shall be paid before any payment is made to Payee. In
the event the Note is declared due and payable before its stated maturity, no
payment shall be made to Payee until principal, interest, and premium on Senior
Debt shall have been paid in full. By acceptance of this Note, Payee agrees to
enter into a subordination agreement on reasonable terms and conditions proposed
by a holder of Senior Debt.

             No remedy conferred upon or reserved or available to Payee shall be
    exclusive of any other remedy or remedies available to him, but each and
    every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every such
    remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission
    on the part of Payee to exercise any right or power arising upon the
    occurrence of any Event of Default shall impair any right or power of Payee
    or be construed to be a waiver by Payee of such Event of Default. Any right
    or power of Payee may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be
    deemed expedient by it.

         Payor hereby: (i) waives demand, presentment for payment, notice of
intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, protest, notice of protest, and
all other notices and diligence in collecting this Note; and (ii) agrees that it
will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce payment of this Note, to
first institute suit or exhaust rights against Payor.
