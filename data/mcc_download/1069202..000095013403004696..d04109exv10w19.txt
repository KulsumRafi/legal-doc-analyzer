         The Plan is hereby amended to delete Paragraph 5 of the Plan, in its
entirety, and replace it with the following:

         "5. Common Stock Available for Awards. Subject to the provisions of
         paragraph 15 hereof, there shall be available for Awards under this
         Plan granted wholly or partly in Common Stock (including rights or
         options that may be exercised for or settled in Common Stock) an
         aggregate of 14,641,635 shares, with 13,481,635 shares available for
         awards to employees and independent contractors and 1,160,000 shares
         available for awards to Nonemployee Directors. The number of shares of
         Common Stock that are the subject to Awards under this Plan, that are
         forfeited or terminated, expire unexercised, are settled in cash in
         lieu of Common Stock or in a manner such that all or some of the shares
         covered by an Award are not issued to a Participant or are exchanged
         for Awards that do not involve Common Stock, shall again immediately
         become available for Awards hereunder. The Committee may from time to
         time adopt and observe such procedures concerning the counting of
         shares against the Plan maximum, as it may deem appropriate. The Board
         and the appropriate officers of the Company shall from time to time
         take whatever actions are necessary to file any required documents with
         governmental authorities, stock exchanges and transaction reporting
         systems to ensure that shares of Common Stock are available for
         issuance pursuant to Awards."
