Equifax, and that Equifax will suffer irreparable harm if Employee breaches any of his or her promises. Therefore, in addition to all the remedies provided at law or in equity, Equifax will be entitled to a temporary restraining order and permanent
injunctions to prevent a breach or contemplated breach of any of Employee&#146;s promises. While Employee will retain the absolute right to pursue any claim, demand, action or cause of action that he or she may have against Equifax, if not otherwise
compromised or released, the existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action by Employee against Equifax, if any, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Equifax of any of Employee&#146;s promises in this Agreement.
