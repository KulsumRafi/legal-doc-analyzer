     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

     (1) As collateral security for the due and punctual payment and performance
of all indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of Pledgor to Pledgee under the
Promissory Note and all of Pledgor's  obligations  under this Agreement and (all
of the foregoing  indebtedness,  liabilities  and  obligations  are  hereinafter
called  the  "Obligations"),   Pledgor  hereby  pledges,   assigns,   transfers,
hypothecates,  delivers and sets over to Pledgee and hereby  grants to Pledgee a
first priority security interest in, and lien upon:

          (a) 100,000  Shares (the "Pledged  Stock") owned by Pledgor and in any
     and all proceeds thereof and  substitutions  therefor,  including,  without
     limitation, any dividends,  distributions and proceeds received, receivable
     or otherwise  distributed or distributable in respect of or in exchange for
     the  Pledged  Stock,  and  concurrently  herewith  delivers  to Pledgee the

          (b) Pledgor's  right to receive any and all  distributions  payable to
     Pledgor with respect to the LTIP (the "LTIP Collateral").

     The Pledged Stock and the LTIP Collateral  collectively  referred to herein

     (2) If Pledgor shall become  entitled to receive or shall receive any stock

dividend or distribution in connection  with any  reclassification,  increase or
reduction  of  capital),  option  or  rights,  whether  as an  addition  to,  in
substitution  of, or in exchange  for any shares of the Pledged  Stock,  Pledgor
shall accept any such instruments as Pledgee's  agent,  shall hold them in trust
for  Pledgee,  and shall  deliver  them  forthwith  to Pledgee in the exact form
received,  with Pledgor's  endorsement when necessary and/or  appropriate  stock
powers  duly  executed  in blank,  to be held by  Pledgee,  subject to the terms
hereof, as further collateral security for the Obligations.

Stock held by Pledgee  hereunder may be registered in the name of Pledgee or his
nominee. Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred, Pledgor shall
have the right to exercise  all  voting,  consent  and  corporate  rights at any
meeting of  shareholders  of Terex  Corporation  or  otherwise  included  in the

of Terex Corporation or otherwise included in the Pledged Stock and exercise any
and all  rights of  conversion,  exchange,  subscription  or any  other  rights,
privileges  or options  pertaining  to any shares of the Pledged  Stock as if he
were the absolute owner  thereof,  all without  liability  except to account for
property  actually  received by Pledgee.  Pledgee shall have no duty to exercise
any of the aforesaid rights,  privileges or options and shall not be responsible
for  any  failure  to do so or  delay  in so  doing.  For the  purposes  of this
Agreement,  "Event  of  Default"  shall  mean any  event of  default  under  the
Promissory Note or any other breach or default of any of the Obligations.

     (4) In the event of the occurrence and during the  continuance of any Event
of Default, Pledgee shall have the right to require that all dividends and other
distributions  payable  with  respect to any part of the  Pledged  Stock be paid
directly to Pledgee and to be held by Pledgee as additional  security  hereunder
until applied to the Obligations, and, at any other time, Pledgor shall have the
right to receive and retain,  free and clear of the lien of this Agreement,  any
and all dividends and other distributions paid or payable by Terex Corporation.

     (5) In the event of the occurrence and during the  continuance of any Event
of Default,  Pledgee may avail himself of any and all of the rights,  powers and
remedies of a secured party under the Uniform  Commercial Code as adopted by the
State of  Connecticut  (as said law may be  amended)  and all of the  rights and
remedies set forth in the Promissory Note and this Agreement,  and in connection
therewith and/or in addition  thereto,  Pledgee without demand of performance or
other  demand,  advertisement  or notice of any kind to or upon  Pledgor  or any
other person (all and each of which demands,  advertisements and/or notices are,
to the extent permitted by law, hereby expressly waived), may forthwith collect,
receive,  appropriate  and realize upon the Pledged Stock,  or any part thereof,
and/or may  forthwith  sell,  assign,  give an option or  options  to  purchase,
contract to sell or otherwise  dispose of and deliver said Pledged Stock, or any
part thereof,  in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
securities  exchange,  broker's  board or  elsewhere  at such prices and on such
terms (including,  without limitation, a requirement that any purchase of all or
any  part of the  Pledged  Stock  shall  be  required  to  purchase  the  shares
constituting  the Pledged Stock for investment and without any intention to make
a distribution thereof) as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future
delivery  without  assumption of any credit risk, with the right to Pledgee,  or
any purchase upon any such sale or sales, whether public or private, to purchase
the whole or any part of the Pledged Stock so sold,  free of any right or equity
of redemption in Pledgor,  which right or equity is hereby  expressly waived and
released.

     (6) The proceeds of any collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation,
realization or sale as aforesaid, shall be applied as follows:

          (a)  First,  to the costs  and  expenses  of every  kind  incurred  in
     connection  therewith or incidental to the care or  safekeeping  of any and
     all of the  Pledged  Collateral  or in any way  relating  to the  rights of
     Pledgee hereunder, including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses;

          (b) Second, to the satisfaction of the Obligations;


                                       2
<PAGE>

          (c) Third, to the payment of any other amounts  required by applicable
     law  (including,  without  limitation,  Section  9-504(1)(c) of the Uniform
     Commercial Code); and

          (d) Fourth, to Pledgor to the extent of the surplus proceeds, if any.

     (7) Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants that:

          (a)  Pledgor is the direct and  beneficial  owner of each share of the
     Pledged Collateral as of the date hereof.

          (b) All of the Pledged  Collateral and all of Pledgor's  right,  title
     and interest in the Terex Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan is, and at
     all times for so long as the  Promissory  Note shall be  outstanding  shall
     continue  to be,  owned by  Pledgor  free and clear of any  pledge,  claim,
     mortgage, hypothecation, lien, charge, encumbrance or any security interest
     in such shares or the  proceeds  thereof  except in the case of the Pledged
     Collateral for the security interest granted to Pledgee hereunder; and

          (c) This Pledge Agreement creates and grants a valid first lien on and
     perfected security interest in the shares of the Pledged Collateral and the
     proceeds thereof,  subject to no prior or existing security interest, lien,
     charge or encumbrance or to any agreement  purporting to grant to any third
     party a security interest in the Pledged Collateral.

          (d) Pledgor has the legal capacity, power and authority to execute and
     deliver the Promissory  Note,  this  Agreement and all other  documents and
     instruments  to be delivered by Pledgor  hereunder,  and to consummate  the
     transactions  contemplated hereby and to take all other actions required to
     be taken by him pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the Promissory Note,
     this Agreement and all other documents and other agreements to be delivered
     by  Pledgors  hereunder  are the legal,  valid and binding  obligations  of
     Pledgor, enforceable against him in accordance with their respective terms.

          (e)  No  consent,  approval,  authorization  or  notification  of,  or
     declaration,  filing or registration with, any governmental entity or third
     party is required on behalf of or on the part of Pledgor in connection with
     the  execution,   delivery  or  performance  of  this  Agreement,   or  the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the execution
     and  delivery  of this  Agreement  by Pledgor nor the  consummation  of the
     transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will with or without the giving
     of notice, lapse of time, or both, constitute any violation or breach of or
     conflict with (i) any judgment,  order, writ, injunction,  decree, statute,
     rule or  regulation  to which  Pledgor or any of his property is subject or
     (ii) any  provisions  of, or  constitute a default  under any  agreement or
     instrument or other  obligation to which Pledgor is a party or by which his
     assets are otherwise bound.

          (f) Pledgor hereby covenants that so long as the Obligations  shall be
     outstanding and unpaid, in whole or in part, Pledgor will not sell, convey,
     transfer  or  otherwise  dispose of any of the  Pledged  Collateral  or any
     interest  therein,  nor will Pledgor  create,  incur or permit to exist any
     pledge,  mortgage,  lien,  charge,  encumbrance  or any  security  interest
     whatsoever  with respect to any of the Pledged  Collateral  or the proceeds
     thereof  other than that created  hereby.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
     Pledgor may sell shares of Pledged Stock provided that 100% of the proceeds
     of any such sale are used (i) first,  to prepay amounts  outstanding  under
     the Promissory Note and (ii) to pay any of the other Obligations.

          (g) Pledgor warrants and will defend Pledgee's right, title,  property

                                       3
<PAGE>

     and security interest in and to the Pledged Stock against the claims of any
     person, firm, corporation or other entity.

     (8)  Pledgor  shall  at any time and  from  time to time  upon the  written
request of Pledgee,  execute  and deliver  such  further  documents,  including,
without  limitation,  one  or  more  financing  statements  in  form  reasonably
satisfactory  to  Pledgee,  and do such  further  acts and things as Pledgee may
reasonably  request in order to effect the  purposes of this  Pledge  Agreement,
including, without limitation,  UCC-1 Financing Statements.  Pledgor irrevocably
appoints Pledgee as its attorney-in-fact  (coupled with an interest) to prepare,
execute and file financing  statements covering the Pledged  Collateral,  either
without the signature of Pledgor or, where Pledgor's  signature is required,  by
signing  as  attorney-in-fact  for  Pledgor.  A  carbon,  photographic  or other
reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement shall be sufficient as
a financing statement.

     (9) Beyond the  exercise of  reasonable  care to assure the safe custody of
the Pledged Stock while held hereunder,  Pledgee shall have no duty or liability
to  preserve  rights   pertaining   thereto,   and  shall  be  relieved  of  all
responsibility  for the  Pledged  Stock  upon  surrendering  it to Pledgor or in
accordance with Pledgor's instructions.

     (10) No course of dealing  between  Pledgor  and Pledgee nor any failure to
exercise, nor any delay in exercising,  on the part of Pledgee, any right, power
or privilege  hereunder or under the Promissory  Note or otherwise shall operate
as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any  single or partial  exercise  of any right,
power or  privilege  hereunder  or  thereunder  preclude  any  other or  further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

     (11)  The  rights  and  remedies  herein  provided,  and  provided  in  the
Promissory Note and all agreements, instruments and documents delivered pursuant
to the Promissory Note or this Agreement, are cumulative and are in addition to,
and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law including,  without
limitation,  the  rights  and  remedies  of a secured  party  under the  Uniform
Commercial Code.

     (12) The provisions of this  Agreement are severable,  and if any clause or
provisions  shall be held  invalid or  unenforceable  in whole or in part in any
jurisdiction,  then such invalidity or  unenforceability  shall affect only such
clause or provision,  or part thereof, in such jurisdiction and shall not in any
manner  affect  such  clause  or  provision  in  any  other   Agreement  in  any
jurisdiction.

     (13) Any and all out-of-pocket  fees, costs and expenses,  of whatever kind
or nature, including the reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses, incurred
by Pledgee in connection  with the enforcing,  foreclosing,  retaking,  holding,
storing, processing,  selling or otherwise realizing upon the Pledged Collateral
and Pledgee's security interest therein, whether through judicial proceedings or
otherwise, or in defending or prosecuting any actions or proceedings arising out
of or related to the transaction to which this Agreement relates, shall be borne
and paid by Pledgor on demand by Pledgee.

     (14) This  Agreement  and all  obligations  of Pledgor  hereunder  shall be
binding upon the assigns,  heirs, legal  representatives of Pledgor,  and shall,
together with the rights and remedies of Pledgee hereunder, inure to the benefit
of Pledgee and his  assigns,  heirs and legal  representatives.  Pledgor may not
assign  any of its  rights or  obligations  hereunder  without  the  consent  of
Pledgee.

                                       4

     (15) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws
of the State of Connecticut without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

     (16) This Agreement or any provision hereof may only be changed,  modified,
amended,  waived or  supplemented by a writing signed by the party to be charged
therewith.
