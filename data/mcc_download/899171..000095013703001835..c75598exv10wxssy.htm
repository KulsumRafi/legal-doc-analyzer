the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to secure the
Executive&#146;s continued services and to ensure the Executive&#146;s continued
dedication and objectivity in the event of any threat or occurrence of, or
negotiation or other action that could lead to, or create the possibility of, a
Change in Control (as defined in Section&nbsp;1) of the Company, without concern as
to whether the Executive might be hindered or distracted by personal
uncertainties and risks created by any such possible Change in Control, and to
encourage the Executive&#146;s full attention and dedication to the Company, the
Board has authorized the Company to enter into this Agreement; and

Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or
any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such
excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;Gross-Up Payment&#148;) in an
amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without
limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with
respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section&nbsp;3(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a
Gross-Up Payment, but that the Executive, after taking into account the
Payments and the Gross-Up Payment, would not receive a net after-tax benefit of
at least $100,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise Tax) as
compared to the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an
elimination of the Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payments, in the
aggregate, to an amount (the &#147;Reduced Amount&#148;) such that the receipt of
Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall
be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced

required to be made under this Section&nbsp;3, including whether and when a Gross-Up
Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions
to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the
Company&#146;s public accounting firm (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;) which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within
15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has
been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the
event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Executive
shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the
determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred
to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive
within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. If the
Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it
shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the
Excise Tax on the Executive&#146;s applicable federal income tax return would not
result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any good faith
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999
of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm
hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made
by the Company should have been made (&#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with the
calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section&nbsp;3(c) and the Executive thereafter is
required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such

Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;This Agreement shall not be terminated by any merger or consolidation
of the Company whereby the Company is or is not the surviving or resulting
corporation or as a result of any transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company. In the event of any such merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets, the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon the
surviving or resulting corporation or the person or entity to which such assets
are transferred. In the event of the consummation of a transaction initiated
by the Company involving the formation of a direct or indirect holding company
of the Company for any internal legal or business purpose in which the holders
of the outstanding voting securities of the Company become the holders of the
outstanding voting securities of such holding company in substantially the same
proportions, the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon such
holding company.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Company agrees that concurrently with any merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets referred to in Section&nbsp;9(a), it will cause any successor or
transferee unconditionally to assume, by written instrument delivered to the
Executive (or the Executive&#146;s beneficiary or estate), all of the obligations of
the Company hereunder. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption prior
to the effectiveness of any such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets
shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
compensation and other benefits from the Company in the same amount and on the
same terms as the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive&#146;s
employment were terminated following a Change in Control other than by reason
of a Nonqualifying Termination during the Termination Period. For purposes of
implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such merger, consolidation or
transfer becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.

Executive&#146;s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive shall
die while any amounts would be payable to the Executive hereunder had the
Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to such
person or persons appointed in writing by the Executive to receive such amounts
or, if no person is so appointed, to the Executive&#146;s estate.

its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have

Association (&#147;AAA&#148;) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in
effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any arbitration shall be held before a
single arbitrator who shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Company
and the Executive, unless the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, in
which case the arbitrator will be selected under the procedures of the AAA. In
connection with the appointment of an arbitrator, the AAA will give the parties
a list of no less than 15 potential arbitrators to strike and number in order
of preference in accordance with AAA procedures. The arbitrator shall have the
authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an
injunction. However, either party may, without inconsistency with this
arbitration provision, apply to any court otherwise having jurisdiction over
such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other
equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is
otherwise resolved. Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this
