<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>As Adopted by the Board on October&nbsp;24, 2001<BR>
and Amended by the Board on November&nbsp;26, 2001</B>i<BR>
<B>and Approved by Stockholders on January&nbsp;18, 2002<BR>

and Amended by the Board on January&nbsp;29, 2003</B></FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE</B>. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentives to attract,
retain and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions
are important to the success of the Company its Parent or Subsidiaries by
offering them an opportunity to participate in the Company&#146;s future performance
through awards of Options, Restricted Stock and Stock Bonuses. Capitalized
terms not defined in the text are defined in Section&nbsp;23.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 Number of Shares Available. Subject to Sections&nbsp;2.2 and 18, the
following number of Shares are available for grant and issuance under the Plan:
(a)&nbsp;12,850,000 Shares, plus (b)&nbsp;1,900,000 Shares resulting from authorized
shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the Company&#146;s 1993
Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;Prior Plan&#148;) on the Effective Date (as defined in
Section&nbsp;19); plus (c)&nbsp;Shares that are subject to: (i)&nbsp;issuance upon exercise of
an Option but cease to be subject to the Option for any reason other than
exercise of the Option; (ii)&nbsp;an Award that otherwise terminates without Shares
being issued; or (iii)&nbsp;are subject to an Award that is forfeited or are
repurchased by the Company at the original issue price. No more than 10,000,000
shares shall be issued as ISOs. At all times the Company will reserve and keep
available a sufficient number of Shares to satisfy the requirements of all
outstanding Options granted under the Plan and all other outstanding but
unvested Awards granted under the Plan.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Adjustment of Shares. If the number of outstanding Shares is changed
by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital
structure of the Company, without consideration, then (a)&nbsp;the number of Shares
reserved for issuance under the Plan, (b)&nbsp;the Exercise Prices of and number of
Shares subject to outstanding Options, (c)&nbsp;the number of Shares subject to
other outstanding Awards, (d)&nbsp;the 10,000,000 maximum number of shares that may
be issued as ISOs set forth in Section&nbsp;2.1; (e)&nbsp;the 2,000,000 and 3,000,000
maximum number of shares that may be issued to an individual in any one
calendar year set forth in Section&nbsp;3; and (f)&nbsp;the annual 500,000 Share limit on
the aggregate number of Shares that may be: (i)&nbsp;made subject to an Option
granted at an Exercise Price of less than Fair Market Value on the date of
grant, (ii)&nbsp;issued under the Plan as a Stock Bonus; and (iii)&nbsp;issued under the
Plan as a Restricted Stock Award at a Purchase Price of less than Fair Market
Value on the date the Award is made, will be proportionately adjusted, subject
to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and
compliance with applicable securities laws; provided that fractions of a Share
will not be issued but will either be paid in cash at Fair Market Value, or
will be rounded up to the nearest Share, as determined by the Committee; and
provided further that the Exercise Price of any Option may not be decreased to
below the par value of the Shares.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY</B>. ISOs may be granted only to employees (including officers
and directors who are also employees) of the Company or of a Parent or
Subsidiary. All other Awards may be granted to employees, officers, directors,
consultants, independent contractors and advisors of the Company or any Parent
or Subsidiary; provided that such consultants, contractors and advisors render
bona fide services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a
capital-raising transaction. The Committee (or its designee under 4.1(c)) will

under the Plan. Any dispute regarding the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">interpretation of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be submitted by
Participant or the Company to the Committee for review. The resolution of such
a dispute by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company and
Participant.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPTIONS</B>. The Committee may grant Options to eligible persons and will
determine (a)&nbsp;whether the Options will be ISOs or NQSOs; (b)&nbsp;the number of
Shares subject to the Option, (c)&nbsp;the Exercise Price of the Option, (d)&nbsp;the
period during which the Option may be exercised, and (e)&nbsp;all other terms and
conditions of the Option, subject to the following:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1 Form of Option Grant. Each Option granted under the Plan will be
evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement that will expressly identify the Option
as an ISO or NQSO. The Stock Option Agreement will be substantially in a form
(which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an
officer of the Company (pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1(b)) has from time to time
approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Plan.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2 Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option will be the date on
which the Committee makes the determination to grant the Option, unless a later
date is otherwise specified by the Committee. The Stock Option Agreement, and
a copy of the Plan and the current Prospectus for the Plan (plus any additional
documents required to be delivered under applicable laws), will be delivered to
the Participant within a reasonable time after the Option is granted. The
Plan, the Prospectus and other documents may be delivered in any manner
(including electronic distribution or posting) that meets applicable legal
requirements.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3 Exercise Period and Expiration Date. Options will be exercisable
within the times or upon the occurrence of events determined by the Committee
and set forth in the Stock Option Agreement, subject to the provisions of
Section&nbsp;5.6, and subject to Company policies established by the Committee (or
by individuals to whom the Committee has delegated responsibility) from time to
time with respect to vesting during leaves of absences. The Stock Option
Agreement shall set forth the last date that the option may be exercised (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;); provided that no Option will be exercisable after the
expiration of ten years from the date the Option is granted; and provided
further that no ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will be exercisable
after the expiration of five years from the date the Option is granted. The
Committee also may provide for Options to become exercisable at one time or
from time to time, periodically or otherwise, in such number of Shares or
percentage of Shares subject to the Option as the Committee determines.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4 Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by
the Committee when the Option is granted and may be less than Fair Market Value
(but not less than the par value of the Shares); provided that (i)&nbsp;the Exercise
Price of an ISO will not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares on
the date of grant and (ii)&nbsp;the Exercise Price of any ISO granted to a Ten
Percent Stockholder will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the
Shares on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than
500,000 Shares annually (less any Shares that have been issued under the Plan
as Stock Bonuses or as Restricted Stock Awards at a price of less than Fair
Market Value on the date of grant) may be made subject to Options
granted at an
Exercise Price that is less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant.
Payment for the Shares purchased must be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 of
the Plan and the Stock Option Agreement.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5 Procedures for Exercise. A Participant or Authorized Transferee may
exercise Options by following the procedures established by the Company&#146;s Stock
Administration Department, as communicated and made available to Participants
through the stock pages on the Intuit Legal Department intranet web site,
and/or through the Company&#146;s electronic mail system.

Participant&#146;s Termination Date, if the Participant is Terminated for any reason
other than &#147;total disability&#148; (as defined in this Section&nbsp;5.6(a)) or death (or
his or her death occurs within three months of Termination). Any Option
granted to a Participant who is an employee who has been actively employed by
the Company or any Subsidiary for one year or more or a director will vest as
to 100% of the Shares subject to such Option, if the Participant is Terminated
due to &#147;total disability&#148; or

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">death (or his or her death occurs within three months of Termination). For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;5.6(a), &#147;total disability&#148; shall mean: (A) (i)&nbsp;for so
long as such definition is used for purposes of the Company&#146;s group life
insurance and accidental death and dismemberment plan or group long term
disability plan, that the Participant is unable to perform each of the material
duties of any gainful occupation for which the Participant is or becomes
reasonably fitted by training, education or experience and which total
disability is in fact preventing the Participant from engaging in any
employment or occupation for wage or profit; or, (ii)&nbsp;if such definition has
changed, such other definition of &#147;total disability&#148; as determined under the
Company&#146;s group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment plan or
group long term disability plan; and (B)&nbsp;the Company shall have received from
the Participant&#146;s primary physician a certification that the Participant&#146;s
total disability is likely to be permanent. Any Option granted to an employee
who is Terminated by the Company, or any Subsidiary or Parent within one year
following the date of a Corporate Transaction, will immediately vest as to such
number of Shares as the Participant would have been vested twelve months after
the date of Termination had the Participant remained employed for that twelve
month period.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.7 Limitations on Exercise. The Committee may specify a reasonable
minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option;
provided that the minimum number will not prevent a Participant from exercising
an Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.8 Limitations on ISOs. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as
of the date of grant) of Shares with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for
the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under the Plan or
under any other incentive stock option plan of the Company or any Parent or
Subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of Shares on
the date of grant with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time
by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the Options for the
first $100,000 worth of Shares to become exercisable in that calendar year will
be ISOs, and the Options for the Shares with a Fair Market Value in excess of
$100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be NQSOs. If the
Code is amended after the Effective Date of the Plan to provide for a different
limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISOs, such
different limit shall be automatically incorporated into the Plan and will
apply to any Options granted after the effective date of the amendment.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9 Notice of Disqualifying Dispositions of Shares Acquired on Exercise of
an ISO. If a Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired
pursuant to the exercise of an ISO on or before the later of (1)&nbsp;the date two
years after the Date of Grant, and (2)&nbsp;the date one year after the exercise of
the ISO (in either case, a &#147;Disqualifying Disposition&#148;), the Participant must
immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. The Participant
may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation
income recognized by the Participant from the Disqualifying Disposition.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.10 Modification, Extension or Renewal. The Committee may modify, extend
or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options in
substitution therefor; provided that any such action may not, without the
written consent of Participant, impair any of Participant&#146;s rights under any
Option previously granted; and provided, further that without stockholder
approval, the modified, extended, renewed or new Option

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">may not have a lower Exercise Price than the outstanding Option. Any
outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered shall
be treated in accordance with Section&nbsp;424(h) of the Code. The Committee may
reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options without the consent of
Participants affected, by a written notice to them; provided, however, that
unless prior stockholder approval is secured, the Exercise Price may not be
reduced below that of the outstanding Option.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.11 No Disqualification. Notwithstanding any other provision in the
Plan, no term of the Plan relating to ISOs will be interpreted, amended or
altered, and no discretion or authority granted under the Plan will be
exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code or,
without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. </B>The Committee may award Restricted Stock
Awards under the Plan to any eligible person. The Committee will determine the
number of Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award, the Purchase Price, the
restrictions on the Shares and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted
Stock Award, subject to the following:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement. All purchases under a Restricted
Stock Award will be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, which
will be in substantially a form (which need not be the same for each
Participant) that the Committee has from time to time approved, and will comply
with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. A Participant can
accept a Restricted Stock Award only by signing and delivering to the Company a
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, and full payment of the Purchase Price,
within thirty days from the date the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement was
delivered to the Participant. If the Participant does not accept the
Restricted Stock Award in this manner within thirty days, then the offer of the
Restricted Stock Award will terminate, unless the Committee determines
