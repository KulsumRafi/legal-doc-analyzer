         WHEREAS, Pegasus Communications Corporation (the "Company") amended and
restated the Pegasus Communications 1996 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan")
effective as of February 13, 2002;

         WHEREAS, Section 13 of the Plan provides that, subject to certain
inapplicable limitations, the Company may amend the Plan at any time; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the grant and vesting provisions
of the Plan that apply to formula awards to be granted to full-time and

         Common Stock as provided in this Section 8. In the case of such an

         shall be granted on the first anniversary of the date the Employee
         first becomes an Employee as a result of hire, provided the Employee is
         then in the employ of the Company or a Related Company. In addition,
         such an Employee who is a part-time Employee on the first anniversary
         of his date of hire shall be granted an additional formula Option under
         this Section 8 as of the date he becomes a full-time Employee. Except
         in the case of an Employee who changes status from part-time to
         full-time, no Employee shall receive more than one Option grant under
         this Section 8. The total number of shares covered by Options granted
         to any Employee under this Section 8 shall not exceed 100.

             This Section 8 shall not apply to Employees first hired prior to
         September 1, 2002 on a full-time or part-time basis. Formula awards
         granted to (or to be granted to) Employees hired prior to September 1,
         2002, shall be governed by the terms of the Plan in effect prior to
         September 1, 2002.
