of such offerings and the parties thereto shall be subject to the terms of this
Security Agreement upon consummation of the applicable offering; and

     The Lenders have requested, and the Borrower has agreed to amend the Notes

referred to herein collectively as the "Secured Parties," and their security
agreements as "Existing Security Agreements"); and

     The Borrower has granted a lien and security interest in the Collateral (as
such term is defined below) pursuant to the terms of that certain security

Agreement"), the Borrower granted the Lenders, on an equal priority with the
Employees, a secondary security interest in the Collateral contemplated by this
Security Agreement effective as of March   , 2002 (the "Effective Date"); and
                                         --

     The Borrower has requested, and the Lenders have agreed, to permit the
Borrower to obtain additional loans in the aggregate principal amount of
$500,000 (the "Additional Priority Loans") from one or more of the Secured
Parties, including new Secured Parties who have not previously loaned funds to
the Borrower, to be secured on an equal priority with the obligations originally
secured by the Existing Security Agreements with Affiliated and Lockhart; and

     The Borrower and the Lenders desire to amend and restate the Original
Security Agreement in the manner set forth herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises set forth therein and
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Borrower hereby agrees as

     all stock issuances by the Borrower (other than in connection with the
     Notes and Warrants) since the beginning of the private placement of Notes

     Security Agreement.

     In each case, the foregoing shall be covered by this Security Agreement,
whether Borrower's ownership or other rights therein are presently held or
hereafter acquired (by operation of law or otherwise) and howsoever Borrower's
interests therein may arise or appear (whether by ownership, security interest,
claim or otherwise).

     Section 2. Security for Liabilities. This Security Agreement secures the
payment of (i) all obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under
the Notes, whether for principal, interest, expenses or otherwise, and (ii) all
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Security
Agreement (all such obligations, together with the obligations, being the
"Liabilities"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Security
Agreement secures (junior in interest only to the superior security interest in
the Collateral granted to the Secured Parties pursuant to the Existing Security
Agreements and on an equal priority with the security interest granted to the
Employees pursuant to the Employee Security Agreement) the payment of all
amounts which constitute part of the Liabilities which are now or at any time
hereafter owing by the Borrower to the Lenders under the Notes.

     Section 3. Representations and Warranties. The Borrower represents and
warrants as of the Effective Date:

          (a) Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
     good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The address of the
     chief place of business and chief executive office of the Borrower is 4600
     S. Ulster, Suite 940, Denver, Colorado 80237.

          (b) The Borrower is the legal and beneficial owner of the Collateral
     free and clear of any lien, security interest, option or other charge or
     encumbrance except for the security interest created by this Security
     Agreement, the security interest granted or to be granted to the Secured
     Parties pursuant to the Existing Security Agreements and the security
     interest granted to the Employees pursuant to the Employee Security
     Agreement. No effective financing statement or other document similar in
     effect covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any
     recording office, except such as may have been filed in favor of the
     Lenders related to this Security Agreement, such as may have been filed in
     favor of the Secured Parties pursuant to the Existing Security Agreements,
     and such as may have been filed in favor of the Employees pursuant to the
     Employee Security Agreement. The Borrower's exact full legal name is, and
     for the previous five year period was, as set forth in the first paragraph
     of this Security Agreement. Borrower has no trade names or styles.

          (c) This Security Agreement creates a valid security interest in the
     Collateral which, upon the filing of a UCC-1 Financing Statement pursuant
     to the applicable provisions of the UCC, shall constitute a perfected
     security interest in the Collateral (junior in interest only to the
     superior security interest in the Collateral granted to the Secured Parties
     pursuant to the Existing Security Agreements and on an equal priority with
     the security interest granted to the Employees pursuant to the Employee
     Security Agreement) securing the payment of the Liabilities.

          (d) As of the date hereof, other than the consent of Affiliated
     Investments, L.L.C. to the grant of a security interest in the Collateral,
     a copy of which has previously been delivered to the Lender Representative
     (as defined below), no consent of any other person or entity and no
     authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing
     with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required (i) for the
     grant by the Borrower of the security interest granted hereby or for the
     execution, delivery or performance of this Security Agreement by the
     Borrower, (ii) for the perfection or maintenance of the security interest
     created hereby (other than the filing of UCC financing Statements
     describing the Collateral, in accordance with the applicable provisions of
     the UCC) or (iii) for the exercise by any Lender of its rights and remedies
     hereunder.

     Section 4. Further Assurances.

          (a) The Borrower agrees that after the Effective Date from time to
     time, at the expense of the Borrower, the Borrower will promptly execute
     and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further
     action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Lender
     Representative may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any
     security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable
     any Lender to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with
     respect to any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, upon the Effective Date, the Borrower will upon such request,
     execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
     thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
     desirable, or as the Lender Representative may request, in order to perfect
     and preserve the security interest granted or purported to be granted
     hereby.

          (b) As of the Effective Date, the Borrower hereby authorizes the
     Lenders to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and
     amendments thereto, related to all or any part of the Collateral without
     the signature of the Borrower where permitted by law. A photocopy or other
     reproduction of this Security Agreement or any financing statement covering
     the Collateral or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing
     statement where permitted by law.

          (c) The Borrower will furnish to the Lender Representative from time
     to time statements and schedules further identifying and describing the
     Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the
     Lender Representative may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail. The
     Lender Representative shall provide promptly all such information to the
     other Lenders.

     Section 5. Location of Collateral. The Borrower shall keep its chief place
of business and chief executive office and the office where it keeps its records
concerning the Collateral, if any, at the locations referred to in Section 3(a)
or, upon 30 days' prior written notice to the Lender Representative, at any
other locations in a jurisdiction where all action required by Section 4 shall
have been taken with respect to the Collateral. The Borrower shall not change
its name or its jurisdiction of incorporation unless prior written notice has
been provided to the Lender Representative.

          (a) Other than as contemplated by the terms of any additional offering
     of the Borrower's securities, the Borrower shall not (i) sell, assign (by
     operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option
     with respect to, any of the Collateral, or (ii) after the Effective Date,
     create or permit to exist any lien, security interest, option or other
     charge or encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Collateral with
     rights superior to those granted to the Lenders under this Security
     Agreement, except as provided herein with respect to the Secured Parties
     (specifically including the Additional Priority Loans).

          (b) Each of the Lenders hereby acknowledges and accepts that the
     Borrower has granted, on an equal priority with the security interest
     granted by this Security Agreement, a security interest in the Collateral
     to the Employees pursuant to the Employee Security Agreement.

          (c) Each of the Lenders expressly acknowledges and accepts that the
     priority of the Secured Parties under the Existing Security Agreements with
     respect to the Additional Priority Loans is superior to the security
     interest granted to the Lenders under this Security Agreement.

     Section 7. Affirmative Covenants of the Borrower. Except as otherwise
consented to in writing by the holders of Notes representing a majority in
interest then outstanding under the Notes, for so long as any obligations remain

          (b) dispose of any material portion of the assets of the Borrower not

          (c) other than with respect to the Secured Parties (specifically

          (f) grant any increase in the compensation payable or to become
     payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Borrower not
     in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice; or

          (g) other than loans to officers and consultants of Polar in an
     aggregate principal amount that is less than the accrued wages or other
     payments due to such officers and consultants, enter into any compensatory
     agreement or arrangements with any of the officers, directors, shareholders
     or employees of the Borrower or any of their respective affiliates not in
     the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

     Section 9. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" shall occur if the
Borrower shall fail to pay the Liabilities or fail to perform any obligations
hereunder, or under the Note. The continuation of either of the following after
10 days written notice to the Borrower shall also constitute an "Event of
Default" hereunder:

          (a) Any representation, warranty, or statement made by the Borrower
     herein or in connection with this Security Agreement or the Note shall
     prove to have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect on or as of
     the date made, or as of the Effective Date, as applicable; or

          (b) The Borrower shall default in the observance or performance of any
     term, indemnity, covenant or agreement contained herein or in connection
     with the Note.

     Section 10. Lender Representative. Each of the Lenders party hereto hereby
irrevocably appoints from time to time the Lender holding the Note representing
the greatest principal amount to be the representative of the Lenders (the
"Lender Representative") to act with full authority in the place and stead of
each of the Lenders and in the name of each Lender

                                       7

<PAGE>

for purposes of this Security Agreement. Each of the Lenders further agrees to
be bound by the actions of the Lender Representative for purposes of Sections
11, and 13 hereof and agrees to hold harmless the Lender Representative from his
actions taken as Lender Representative hereunder, as long as Lender
Representative is acting in good faith and without gross negligence or willful
malfeasance. To the extent that the Lender holding the Note representing the
greatest principal amount declines to act as the Lender Representative, such
Lender may designate another Lender to act as the Lender Representative, and the
appointment and agreement of each of the Lenders provided by this Section 10
shall apply to such designated Lender Representative.

     Section 11. Lender Representative Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. The Borrower
hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender Representative the attorney-in-fact of
the Borrower, with full authority in the place and stead of the Borrower and in
the name of the Borrower, any of the Lenders or otherwise, from time to time in
the Lender Representative's discretion following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action and to execute any
instrument which the Lender Representative may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes of this Security Agreement, including, without
limitation:

          (a) To ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise, receive and
     give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in
     connection with the Collateral.

          (b) To receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other instruments,
     documents and chattel paper, in connection therewith.

          (c) To file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings
     which the Lender Representative may deem necessary or desirable for the
     collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of
     any Lender with respect to any of the Collateral.

     The provisions of this Section 11 shall terminate upon termination of all
of the Notes and the complete satisfaction and repayment of all of Borrower's
obligations thereunder.

     Section 12. The Lenders' Duties. Except for the safe custody of any
Collateral in their possession and the accounting for moneys actually received
by them hereunder, the Lenders shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to
the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or
any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Lenders shall be deemed to
have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral
in their possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal
to that which such Lender accords its own property.

     Section 13. Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

          (a) Subject to Borrower's right to redeem the Collateral at any time
     prior to any disposition of such collateral to a bona fide third party, the
     Lender Representative may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
     addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
     available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default
     under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected

                                       8

<PAGE>

     Collateral), and also may (i) require the Borrower to, and the Borrower
     hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Lender
     Representative forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as
     directed by the Lender Representative and make it available to the Lender
     Representative at a place to be designated by the Lender Representative
     which is reasonably convenient to both parties and (ii) without notice
     except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one
     or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Lender
     Representative's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
     delivery, and upon such other terms as the Lender Representative may deem
     commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of
     sale shall be required by law, at least fifteen days' notice to the
     Borrower of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which
     any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.
     The Lender Representative shall not be obligated to make any sale of
     Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Lender
     Representative may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by
     announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
     without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
     adjourned. The Lender Representative may disclaim warranties of title,
     possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any action pursuant to this
     paragraph shall not affect the commercial reasonableness of the sale.

          (b) Any cash held by the Lender Representative as Collateral and all
     cash proceeds received by the Lender Representative in respect of any sale
     of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the
     Collateral may, in the discretion of the Lender Representative, be held by
     the Lender Representative as Collateral for, and/or then or at any time
     thereafter be applied in whole or in part by the Lender Representative
     against, all or any part of the Liabilities. Any surplus of such cash or
     cash proceeds held by the Lender Representative and remaining after payment
     in full of all the Liabilities shall be paid over to the Borrower or to
     whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

     Section 14. Amendments, Etc.

          (a) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Security
     Agreement, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower heretofrom,
     shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and
     signed by Lenders holding Notes representing at least two-thirds of the
     then current aggregate outstanding principal amount owing under the Notes
     to the Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in
     the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

     Section 15. Addresses for Notices. All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be made, and shall be effective when made, in the
manner and to the addresses set forth in the Notes.

     Section 16. Continuing Security Interest. This Security Agreement shall
create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in

and (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Lender and its
permitted successors, transferees and assigns. Upon any termination of the
Security Agreement, each of the Lenders will, at the Borrower's expense, execute
and deliver to the Borrower such documents as the Borrower shall reasonably
request to evidence such termination.

     Section 17. GOVERNING LAW. EACH OF THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWER AGREES THAT
EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST HEREUNDER, OR ANY OF THE REMEDIES
HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF PARTICULAR COLLATERAL, MAY BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF COLORADO, ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR
OTHERWISE, SHALL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
COLORADO.

     Section 18. Arbitration.

     (a) Any controversy or claim (including, without limitation, whether any
controversy or claim is subject to arbitration ) arising out of or relating to
this Security Agreement, or the breach thereof (whether, in any case, involving
(x) a party hereto, (y) their transferees or (z) such party's or transferee's
directors, officers, partners, members, managers, employees, representatives or
agents), shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules
("Rules"), and shall be held in Denver, Colorado.

     (b) Any dispute submitted for arbitration shall be referred to a panel of
three arbitrators. The party or parties submitting (the "Submitting Party") the
intention to arbitrate (the "Submission") shall nominate one arbitrator. Within
30 days of receipt of the Submission, the party or parties receiving the
Submission (the "Answering Party") shall nominate one arbitrator. If the
Answering Party fails to timely nominate an arbitrator, then the second
arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with the Rules. If the
arbitrator chosen by the Submitting Party and the arbitrator chosen by or
selected for the Answering Party can agree upon a neutral arbitrator within
fifteen days of the choice or selection of the Answering Party's arbitrator,
then such individual shall serve as the third arbitrator. If no such agreement
is reached, a third neutral arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA in
accordance with the Rules. The parties agree that they shall consent to an
expedited proceeding under the Rules, to the full extent the AAA can accommodate
such a request.

     (c) The ruling of the arbitrators shall be binding and conclusive upon all
parties hereto and any other Person with an interest in the matter.

     (d) The arbitration provision set forth in this Section 18 shall be a
complete defense to any suit, action or other proceeding instituted in any court
regarding any controversy or claim (including, without limitation, whether any
controversy or claim is subject to arbitration) arising

                                       10

out of or relating to this Security Agreement, or the breach thereof (whether,
in any case, involving (x) a party hereto, (y) their transferees or (z) such
party's or transferee's directors, officers, partners, members, managers,
employees, representatives or agents); provided, however, that (i) any of the
parties to the arbitration may request a District Court in the City and County
of Denver, Colorado, to provide interim injunctive relief in aid of arbitration
hereunder or to prevent a violation of this Security Agreement pending
arbitration hereunder (and any such request shall not be deemed a waiver of the
obligations to arbitrate set forth in this Section), (ii) any ruling on the
award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered as a final judgment in (and
only in) a District Court in the City and County of Denver, Colorado (and each
of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court for
such purposes) and (iii) application may be made by a party to any court of
competent jurisdiction wherever situated for enforcement of any such final
judgment and the entry of whatever orders are necessary for such enforcement. In
any proceeding with respect hereto, all direct, reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, AAA administration fees and arbitrator fees)
incurred by the parties to the proceeding shall, at the conclusion of the
proceeding, be paid by the party incurring same.

     Section 19. Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Security Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Security Agreement
shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating
the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Security
Agreement.

     Section 20. Section Headings. All section headings are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect any construction or
interpretation of this Security Agreement.

     Section 21. Execution. This Security Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. To the extent
that any other document or instrument between the Borrower and any of the
Lenders in existence as of the date hereof purports to grant any security
interest in and to the Collateral to any of the Lenders, this Security Agreement
hereby supercedes and replaces any such document or instrument and all terms
thereof.
