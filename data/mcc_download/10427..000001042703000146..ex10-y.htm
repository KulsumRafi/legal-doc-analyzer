In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the Effective Date, each of the letters of credit listed on Schedule 2.03 (the "<U>Existing Letters of Credit</U>") shall be deemed to constitute Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Participations.</U>  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  The Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each drawing  made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Drawing and Reimbursement</U>.  The payment by an Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of an Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft.  The Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Borrower and the Agent.  Upon written demand by the Agent, each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Advance to be funded by such Lender.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank.  Each Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Advance on (i)&nbsp;the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, <U>provided</U> that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New&nbsp;York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii)&nbsp;the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time.  If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable.  If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.</P>

<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Letter of Credit Reports</U>.  Each Issuing Bank shall furnish (A)&nbsp;to the Agent on the first Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and (B)&nbsp;to the Agent and each Lender on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit.</P>

<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Failure to Make Advances</U>.  The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it on the date specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.</P>

<P>SECTION 2.13&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payments and Computations</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  (a)  The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New&nbsp;York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the Agent's Account in same day funds.  The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees or Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable.  Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.</P>

<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.</P>
<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.</P>

<P>SECTION 2.14&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Taxes</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  (a)  Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future withholding taxes, including levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, <U>excluding</U>, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "<U>Taxes</U>").  If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i)&nbsp;the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section&nbsp;2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes, but excluding all other United States federal taxes other than withholding taxes (hereinafter referred to as "<U>Other Taxes</U>").</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section&nbsp;2.14) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.</P>

<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section&nbsp;8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment.  In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, the Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this subsection&nbsp;(d) and subsection&nbsp;(e), the terms "<U>United States</U>" and "<U>United States person</U>" shall have the meanings specified in Section&nbsp;7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>

<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes.  If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection&nbsp;(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.  If any form or document referred to in this subsection&nbsp;(e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.</P>

<P>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section&nbsp;2.14(e) (<U>other</U> <U>than</U> if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection&nbsp;(e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section&nbsp;2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.</P>

<P>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.</P>

<P>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit of any Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) above in respect of payments under the Credit Agreement or the Notes, a current monetary benefit that it would otherwise not have obtained, and that would result in the total payments under this Section 2.14 exceeding the amount needed to make such Lender whole, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower, with reasonable promptness following the date on which it actually realizes such benefit, an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of such benefit or the amount of such excess, in each case net of all out-of-pocket expenses in securing such refund, deduction or credit.</P>

<P>SECTION 2.15&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Sharing of Payments, Etc</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)&nbsp;the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii)&nbsp;the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.</P>

<P>SECTION 2.16&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Use of Proceeds</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including acquisitions.</P>
<P><A NAME="_Toc29974667"></P>
<P>SECTION 2.17&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Evidence of Debt</A></U>.  (a)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances.  The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.</P>

<P>(b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (I) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.</P>

In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section&nbsp;7.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.</P>

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse any such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the extent that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Borrower.</P>

<P>SECTION 7.06&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Successor Agent</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent with the consent, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.</P>

<P>SECTION 8.07&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignments and Participations</A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></U>.  (a)  Each Lender may, and if demanded by the Borrower (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.14) upon at least five Business Days' notice to such Lender and the Agent will, assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i)&nbsp;each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii)&nbsp;each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.07(a) shall be arranged by the Borrower after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v)&nbsp;no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Borrower or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement and (vi)&nbsp;the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 payable by the parties to each such assignment, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the case of each assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrower, such recordation fee shall be payable by the Borrower except that no such recordation fee shall be payable in the case of an assignment made at the request of the Borrower to an Eligible Assignee that is an existing Lender, and (vii) any Lender may, without the approval of the Borrower and the Agent, assign all or a portion of its rights to any of its Affiliates.  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x)&nbsp;the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y)&nbsp;the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).</P>

<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i)&nbsp;other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii)&nbsp;such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii)&nbsp;such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section&nbsp;4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv)&nbsp;such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v)&nbsp;such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi)&nbsp;such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii)&nbsp;such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.</P>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section&nbsp;8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Revolving Credit Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</P>

<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit&nbsp;C hereto, (i)&nbsp;accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii)&nbsp;record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii)&nbsp;give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.  Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment retained by it hereunder.  Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto.</P>

<P>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i)&nbsp;such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii)&nbsp;such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii)&nbsp;such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv)&nbsp;the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v)&nbsp;no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation.</P>

<P>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Lender may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "<U>SPC</U>") the option to fund all or any part of any Advance that such Lender is obligated to fund under this Agreement (and upon the exercise by such SPC of such option to fund, such Lender's obligations with respect to such Advance shall be deemed satisfied to the extent of any amounts funded by such SPC); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) any such option granted to an SPC shall not constitute a commitment by such SPC to fund any Advance, (v) neither the grant nor the exercise of such option to an SPC shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its obligations under Section 2.10) (vi) the SPC shall be bound by the provisions of Section 8.08 and (vii) no SPC shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, nor any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such grant of funding option, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such grant of funding option.  Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable.  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this clause (f), an SPC shall have all the rights of the granting Lender.  An SPC may assign or participate all or a portion of its interest in any Advances to the granting Lender or to any financial institution providing liquidity or credit support to or for the account of such SPC without paying any processing fee therefor and, in connection therewith may disclose on a confidential basis any information relating to the Borrower to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPC.  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (which agreements shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.</P>

<P>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment, designation, participation or grant of funding option or proposed assignment, designation, participation or grant of funding option pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee, designee, participant or SPC or proposed assignee, designee, participant or SPC, any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee, designee, participant or SPC or proposed assignee, designee, participant or SPC shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Specified Information relating to any Borrower received by it from such Lender.</P>

<P>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee its rights and obligations or any portion of the undrawn Letter of Credit Commitment at any time; provided, however, that  (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit Commitment of the assigning Issuing Bank being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.</P>

<P>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and any Note held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation&nbsp;A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</P>
