                       SECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

         THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of
August 27, 2002, is entered into by and among:

                  (1) CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
         company ("Borrower");

                  (2) LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle National
         Bank, as trustee for the registered Holders of Prudential Mortgage
         Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
         Series 1998-1 ("Lender");

                  (3) Each of the certificateholders listed in Schedule I
         attached hereto (collectively, the "Certificateholders") comprising all
         of the holders of Certificates as defined in that certain Trust and
         Servicing Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, by and among
         Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, as Depositor, The
         Prudential Insurance Company of America, as Servicer, ABN AMRO Bank
         N.V., as Fiscal Agent, and LaSalle National Bank, as Trustee (the
         "Trust and Servicing Agreement"); and

                  (4) THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, as servicer
         under the Trust and Servicing Agreement (in such capacity, "Servicer").

                                    RECITALS

         A.       Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 (the "Original Loan Agreement") between Borrower and Prudential
Mortgage Capital Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"),
predecessor-in-interest to Lender, as amended by that certain First Amendment to
Loan Agreement dated as of January 11, 2001, by and among Borrower, Lender, the
Certificateholders, and Servicer (the "First Amendment") (the Original Loan
Agreement as amended by the First Amendment, as the same may hereinafter be
consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or restated or renewed from time
to time, collectively, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the
Original Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00).

         B.       Prudential assigned all of its right, title and interest under
the Loan to Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, which in turn assigned
all of its right, title and interest under the Loan to Lender in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Trust and Servicing Agreement.

         C.       In connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower pledged
to Prudential as collateral for the Loan, among other things, certain "Expansion
Land" comprising a portion of

<PAGE>

the Property identified as IL1970104, Romeoville, Illinois in Exhibit A to the
Loan Agreement (the "Gillette Property"); such Expansion Land, consisting of
approximately 14.92 acres of land, as more specifically described on Exhibit A
attached hereto, is hereinafter referred to as the "Gillette Expansion Parcel"
and the remaining portion of the Gillette Property hereinafter referred to as
the "Remaining Property."

         D. Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 2.15(b) of the Loan
Agreement for the release of Expansion Land, Borrower has requested Lender, the
Certificateholders and the Servicer to amend the Loan Agreement and the
applicable mortgage to release Lender's lien to the Gillette Expansion Parcel
under the Loan Documents.

         E. Lender, the Certificateholders, and the Servicer are willing so to
amend the Loan Agreement and the applicable mortgage upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Borrower, Lender, the Certificateholders and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

         1. Definitions, Interpretation. All capitalized terms defined above and
elsewhere in this Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise
defined herein, all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the
respective meanings given to those terms in the Loan Agreement, as amended by
this Amendment.

         2. Amendments to Loan Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 5 below, (a) Section 2.15 of the Loan Agreement
is hereby amended by releasing and deleting therefrom the Gillette Expansion
Parcel, (b) Exhibit A of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
therefrom the Gillette Expansion Parcel, and (c) Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement is hereby amended by deleting therefrom the Gillette Expansion Parcel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release of the Gillette Expansion Parcel
shall not constitute a release of Borrower's indemnification obligations under
the Loan Agreement or under the other Loan Documents as to any matters or claims
which occurred or relate to any matters or claims which occurred on or before
the Effective Date (as defined below) with respect to the Gillette Expansion
Parcel and such obligations shall survive the release of the Gillette Expansion
Parcel from the Property Pool.

         3. Representations and Warranties of Borrower. Borrower hereby
represents and warrants to Lender, the Certificateholders and Servicer that the
following are true and correct on the date of this Amendment and that, after
giving effect to the amendment set forth in Paragraph 2 above, the following
will be true and correct on the Effective Date (as defined below):

            (a) The representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in
         Article V of the Loan Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are
         true and correct in all material

                                       2

<PAGE>

         respects as if made on such date (except for representations and
         warranties expressly made as of a specified date, which shall be true
         as of such date);

                  (b) No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing;

                  (c) All of the Loan Documents are in full force and effect;

                  (d) There are no existing rights, conditions or options to
         expand onto, to lease, or to purchase, all or any portion of the
         Gillette Expansion Parcel held by any tenant or any other party with an
         interest to the Remaining Property. All options, rights of first
         refusal or any other right to lease or purchase all or any portion of
         the Gillette Expansion Parcel, if any, held by any past or present
         tenant or any other person with an interest in the Gillette Property
         have either been terminated, waived or expired, such that the Gillette
         Expansion Parcel can be separated from the Remaining Property without
         any resulting adverse consequences to Lender.

                  (e) The fair market value of all the Properties securing the
         Loan as of the Closing Date as listed on Schedule 1 to the Loan
         Agreement was $522,829,999, and, to Borrower's knowledge, the current
         fair market value of all the Properties currently securing the Loan as
         of the date hereof has not materially and adversely changed from the
         fair market values as of the Closing Date; and

                  (f) The fair market value of the Gillette Expansion Parcel on
         the Closing Date of the Loan and the current fair market value of the
         Gillette Expansion Parcel as of the date hereof is not more than
         $1,850,000.00 per an appraisal dated July 29, 1999.

(Without limiting the scope of the term "Loan Documents," Borrower expressly
acknowledges in making the representations and warranties set forth in this
Paragraph 3 that, on and after the date hereof, such term includes this
Amendment.)

         4.       Representations of Servicer to Lender and Certificateholders.
Servicer hereby represents and warrants to Lender and the Certificateholders
that the following are true and correct on the date of this Amendment:

                  (a) To Servicer's knowledge, the outstanding principle balance
of the Loan as of the date of this Amendment is Three Hundred Fifty-Four Million
Three Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Six Hundred Thirty-Eight and 74/100 dollars
($354,345,638.74);

                  (b) Servicer is not receiving any loan payments or fees from
Borrower in connection with the release of the Gillette Expansion Parcel other
than for amounts intended to reimburse Servicer for costs and expenses in
handling the transaction; and

                  (c) The release of the Gillette Expansion Parcel will not
change the Servicer's payment expectations with respect to the Loan.

         determination assuming the separate ownership and operation of the
         Remaining Property from the Gillette Expansion Parcel;

                  (f) Evidence that (1) all zoning and subdivision approvals of
         Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction as necessary to create

         of the Remaining Property; and (2) from and after the release of the
         Gillette Expansion Parcel, no acts relating to development, further
         subdivision, construction or use on the Gillette Expansion Parcel can
         affect in any respect the compliance of the Remaining Property with all
         Governmental Rules;

                  (g) Copies of all existing tenant leases and amendments
         thereto for the Gillette Property and a tenant estoppel certificate

         that there are no conditions under the lease in which the tenant could
         in the future exercise an option, or any other right to lease, expand,

         Parcel.

                  (h) Evidence that, following the release of the Gillette

         Expansion Parcel;

                  (k) An opinion of counsel (obtained at the expense of
         Borrower) to the effect that this Amendment and the release of the
         Gillette Expansion Parcel will not cause either the Lower-Tier REMIC or
         the Upper Tier REMIC (as such terms are defined in the Trust and
         Servicing Agreement) to fail to qualify as REMIC for federal income tax
         purposes;

         the Certificateholders; and

                  (o) Such other evidence as Lender, the Certificateholders and
         Servicer may reasonably request to establish the accuracy and

Agreement shall mean the Loan Agreement as amended hereby. Except as
specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents

LEASES AND RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING (this "Amendment"),
dated as of August 27, 2002, is entered into by and between CATELLUS FINANCE 1,
L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Mortgagor"), having an address at

                                    RECITALS

     A. Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of October 26,
1998 (the "Original Loan Agreement") between Mortgagor and PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE
CAPITAL COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-
in-interest to Mortgagee, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Loan
Agreement dated as of January 11, 2001, by and among Mortgagor, Mortgagee, and
The Prudential Insurance Company of America, as the Certificateholder and

modified, amended and/or restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan
Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Original Loan Agreement, Prudential
agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"), evidenced by that certain promissory note
dated October 26, 1998, in the original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED
SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by,
among other things, that certain Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents,
Security Agreement and Fixture Filing dated as of September 7, 1999, and
recorded on September 8, 1999 as Document R1999111415 in the Official Records of

     B. As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, the Gillette
Mortgage encumbers, among other properties, expansion land comprising a portion
of the Property identified as IL1970104, Gillette, Romeoville, Illinois in
Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion land referred to herein as the
"Gillette Expansion Land").

     C. Mortgagee and Mortgagor now desire to amend the Gillette Mortgage to
release the Gillette Expansion Land from the lien of the Gillette Mortgage.

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Mortgagee and Mortgagor hereby agree as follows:

     1. Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,

hereby releases and discharges from the lien of the Gillette Mortgage that

remain encumbered by the Gillette Mortgage in accordance with the terms thereof.

         3. Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of Will County, Illinois, each reference in the
Loan Agreement to the Mortgage encumbering the property identified as IL1970104,
Gillette, shall mean such Mortgage as amended hereby. Except as specifically
amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement, the Gillette Mortgage and the other Loan
Documents shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
affirmed and (b) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment
shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any
right, power, or remedy of Mortgagee, nor constitute a waiver of any provision
of the Loan Agreement, the Gillette Mortgage or any other Loan Document.

         4. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number
         of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
         which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
         signature page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed
         therefrom and attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution
         thereof by all of the parties hereto without affecting the validity
         thereof.

                  (b) Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience
         of reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF
                         ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND
RENTS (this "Amendment"), dated as of August 27, 2002, is entered into by and

                                    RECITALS

                  A. Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as
of October 26, 1998 (the "Original Loan Agreement") between Assignor and
PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE CAPITAL COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Assignee, as amended by that certain
First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of January 11, 2001, by and among
Assignor, Assignee, and The Prudential Insurance Company of America, as the
Certificateholder and Servicer (the "First Amendment") (the Original Loan

consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or restated or renewed from time

Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"), evidenced by that
certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the original principal amount
of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and

comprising a portion of the Property identified as IL1970104, Gillette,
Romeoville, Illinois, in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion land
referred to herein as the "Gillette Expansion Land").

                  C. Assignee and Assignor now desire to amend the Gillette
Assignment of Leases to release the Gillette Expansion Land from the lien of the
Gillette Assignment of Leases.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Assignee and Assignor hereby agree as follows:

         1. Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in

of Leases that portion, and only that portion, of the real property and
improvements encumbered by the Gillette Assignment of Leases which is more
particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof (the

Loan Agreement to the Assignment of Leases and Rents encumbering the property
identified as IL1970104, Gillette, Romeoville, Illinois, shall mean such
Assignment of Leases and Rents as amended hereby. Except as specifically amended
above, (a) the Loan Agreement, the Gillette Assignment of Leases and the other
Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
affirmed and (b) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment
shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any
right, power, or remedy of Assignee, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of
the Loan Agreement, the Gillette Assignment of Leases or any other Loan
Document.

         4. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number
         of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
         which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
         signature page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed
         therefrom and attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution
         thereof by all of the parties hereto without affecting the validity
         thereof.

                  (b) Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience
         of reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

                  (c) Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and
         construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the
         laws of the State of Illinois as provided in the Gillette Assignment of
         Leases.
