consolidated basis will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and

effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the

property useful and necessary in the business of the CK Companies as then
conducted in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

         (b) The Borrower will maintain, with financially sound and reputable
insurance companies adequate insurance for the insurable properties of the CK

locations.

5.3      Refinancing.

<PAGE>


              (a) The Borrower will use its best efforts on an expedited basis
to refinance the Loan as soon as possible after the post-Closing Date audit of
the CK Companies has been completed (the "Refinancing"). The Borrower shall use
its best efforts to cause such audit to be completed as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date.

              (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that in order to fund the
Refinancing, it shall accept an offer to purchase any debt securities (the
"Refinancing Securities") that are saleable in light of the then current market
conditions, bear an interest rate (prior to any default) of not more than the
lower of (i)15% per annum and (ii) the maximum interest rate the Borrower may be
permitted to incur under the Subordinated Debt Documents, would otherwise be
permitted under the Credit Facility to be issued by the Borrower and have a
maturity of not more ten years from the date of issuance. All other material
arrangements with respect to the Refinancing Securities shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower in light of the then prevailing market conditions.
The Borrower further covenants to use its best efforts on an expedited basis to
prepare all necessary offering documents and participate in due diligence and
marketing efforts (including a road show) in order to sell the Refinancing
Securities.

         5.4 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will comply, and cause each
Subsidiary to comply, with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations,
and requirements of governmental authorities (including Environmental Laws and
ERISA and the rules and regulations thereunder) except where failure to comply
would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or where the necessity of compliance
therewith is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.

         5.5 Inspection of Property, Books and Records. The Borrower will keep,
and will cause each Subsidiary to keep, proper books of record and account
reflecting its business and activities; and will permit, and will cause each
Subsidiary to permit, upon reasonable prior notice, representatives of any
Lender at such Lender's expense to visit and inspect any of their respective
properties, to examine and make abstracts from any of their respective books and
records and to discuss their respective affairs, finances and accounts with
their respective officers, senior employees and independent public accountants,
all during normal business hours and as often as may reasonably be desired;
provided that the Borrower may, at their option, have one or more employees or
representatives present at any such inspection, examination or discussion.

         5.6 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loan made under this Agreement
will be used by the Borrower solely to pay a portion of the purchase price for
the Capital Stock of the CK Companies and to pay Transaction Costs.

         5.7 Environmental Matters. The Borrower will promptly give to the
Lenders notice in writing of any complaint, order, citation or notice of
violation with respect to, or if a Borrower becomes aware of, (i) the existence
or alleged existence of a violation of any applicable Environmental Law, (ii)
any release into the environment, (iii) the commencement of any cleanup pursuant
to or in accordance with any applicable Environmental Law of any Hazardous
Materials, (iv) any proceeding pending against a Borrower for the termination,
suspension or


<PAGE>


non-renewal of any permit required under any applicable Environmental Law, (v)
any property of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary that is or will be subject to a
Lien imposed pursuant to any Environmental Law and (vi) any proposed
acquisitions or leasing of property, which, in each of cases (i) through (vi)
above, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.8 Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, pay and discharge promptly when due all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries or upon
their respective income or profits or in respect of their respective properties
before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful
claims for labor, materials and supplies or otherwise, which, if unpaid, would
give rise to Liens upon such properties or any part thereof provided, however,
that such payment and discharge shall not be required with respect to (1) any
such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as the validity or amount
thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the
applicable party, shall have set aside on its books reserves with respect
thereto as required by GAAP, and such contest operates to suspend collection of
the contested tax, assessment, charge, levy or claims and enforcement of a Lien
or (ii) any tax, assessment, charge, levy or claims, the failure to pay and
discharge when due which, individually or in the aggregate would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.9 Security Interests. The Borrower will at all times take, or permit
to be taken, all actions necessary for the Administrative Agent to maintain the
Lien on the Collateral created under the Pledge and Security Agreement as a
first priority valid and perfected Lien on the Collateral, and supply all
information to the Administrative Agent necessary for such maintenance.

         5.10 Existence; Conduct of Business. The Borrowers will, and will cause
each of the CK Companies to, do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal existence and the
rights, licenses, permits, privileges, franchises, patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade names material to the conduct of the business of the CK
Companies; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.3.

         5.11 Litigation and Other Notices. The Borrower will give the
Administrative Agent prompt written notice of the following:

              (a) the issuance against a Borrower or a Guarantor by any court or
Governmental Body of any injunction, order, decision or other restraint
prohibiting, or having the effect of prohibiting, the making of the Loan, or
invalidating, or having the effect of invalidating, any provision of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents that would materially adversely affect the
Lenders' ability to enforce any payment obligations hereunder, or the initiation
of any litigation or similar proceeding seeking any such injunction, order,
decision or other restraint;

<PAGE>



              (b) the filing or commencement of any action, suit or proceeding
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, whether at law or in equity or
by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Body, (i) which is material and is
brought by or on behalf of any Governmental Body, or in which injunctive or
other equitable relief is sought or (ii) as to which it is probable (within the
meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5) that there will be
an adverse determination in each case and which, if adversely determined, would
(A) reasonably be expected to result in liability of the Borrower or a
Subsidiary thereof in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or more, not
reimbursable by insurance, or (B) materially impairs the right of the Borrower
or a Subsidiary thereof to perform its material obligations under this
Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document to which it is a party;

              (c) any Default, specifying the nature and extent thereof and the
action (if any) which is proposed to be taken with respect thereto;

to the Credit Facility, Subordinated Debt Documents or any other subordinated
indebtedness; and

              (e) any development in the business or affairs of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries which has had or which is likely to have, in the
reasonable judgment of the Borrower, a Material Adverse Effect.

foregoing the consent of each affected Lender will be required for any amendment
or waiver that (i) reduces the principal of, or reduces the rate of or changes
the time for payment of interest on any Note, or extends, the maturity of any
Note or (ii) modifies any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Notes

         8.6 Participations.

              (a) Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to sell to any Person participations in all or any portion of the amount of
the Loan made by such Lender; provided, however, that the amount of the Loan in
which the Lenders, collectively, have not granted participations to Persons
other than Affiliates of the Lenders shall at all times constitute in excess of
50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Loan; and provided, further,
that no such participation shall, without the consent of the Borrower, require
the Borrower to file a registration statement with the SEC or apply to qualify
such participation under the securities law of any state. No Lender shall, as
between the Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations
hereunder as a result of granting any participation in the Loan.

              (b) The holder of any participation, other than an Affiliate of
the Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except action directly
affecting (i) the extension of the maturity date of the Loan or (ii) a reduction
of the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on the Loan, and all
amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if the Lender
had not sold such participation. The Borrower and each Lender hereby agree that,
solely for purposes Sections 8.7 and 8.13, (a) each participation will give rise
to a direct obligation of the Borrower to the participant and (b) the
participant shall be deemed to be a "Lender".

              (c) Each Lender may from time to time furnish to participants any
information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the possession of
that Lender.

         8.7 Ratable Sharing. The Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if
any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security,
through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim
or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or
otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral
under Title 11 of the United States Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, fees and other
amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to such Lender) which is
greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the
Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent and
each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of
such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have
purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by
such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the
other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be
shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them;
provided that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by
such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Lender upon the
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases shall
be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be
returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement
and agrees that any


<PAGE>


holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing
by the Borrower to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder
were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder.

         8.8 Assignment; Parties in Interest.

              (a) No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by the Borrower without the prior written
consent of the Requisite Lenders. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Lender without the prior
written consent of the Borrower; provided, however, that any Lender may assign
all or any portion of the Loan to its affiliates or to another Lender or its
affiliates without the consent of the Borrower; provided, further, that upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default any Lender may
assign all or any portion of the Loan. Any attempted assignment without the
required consent shall be void.

              (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors,
transferees and assigns.

         8.9 Limitation of Liability. The liability of each of the Lenders for a
breach of its covenants and obligations hereunder and under the Securities
Purchase Agreement shall be limited to the amount specified in Section 9.04 of
the Securities Purchase Agreement.

         8.10 Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder shall be several and not joint. No Lender shall be responsible for the
breach of any provision of this Agreement by any other Lender.

         8.11 Governing Law. This Agreement and (unless otherwise provided) all
amendments hereof and waivers and consents hereunder shall be governed by the
internal Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of Law
principles thereof which would specify the application of the Law of another
jurisdiction.

         8.12 Jurisdiction. Each of the Lenders and the Borrower (a) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in New York County, New York for the purposes of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof brought by the Borrower or any Lender and (b) hereby
waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise,
in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit, action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit,
action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof may not be enforced in or by such court.

Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their

assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-party
beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

         8.14 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

              (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loan,
including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of the Loan.

              (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and each Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person
being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from,
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including
the fees, charges and disburseents of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as
a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to
the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) the Loan or the use
of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any other property currently or formerly owned or
operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental
Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv)
any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined in a final adjudication not subject to further appeal to have
resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee or any Affiliate of such Indemnitee (or of any officer, director,
employee, advisor or agent of such Indemnitee or any of such Indemnitee's
Affiliates).

              (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, each Lender severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Lender's pro rata share
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its
capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be
determined based upon its share of the Loan.

<PAGE>



              (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby.

              (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

         8.15 Immunity of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent, in its
capacity as such, shall have no liability whatsoever to the Borrower. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors,
employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any action taken or omitted
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents except to the extent determined in a final adjudication not subject to
further appeal to have been caused solely by the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take
an action) in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it
hereunder or thereunder unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received instructions in respect thereof from the Lenders and, upon receipt of
such instructions from the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power,
discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions. Without prejudice
to the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and shall be
entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of
attorneys (who may be attorneys for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries),
accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative
Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or (where so instructed)
refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
in accordance with the instructions of the Lenders.

         8.16 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or
other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents and the making of the Loan, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time the Loan is advanced
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Liability
is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 8.7, 8.13, 8.14 and 8.16
shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or the satisfaction in full of the
Obligations.

<PAGE>



         8.17 Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at
any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that
such Lender may have.

         8.18 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

         8.19 Injunctive Relief. In the event that any party threatens to take
any action prohibited by this Agreement, the parties agree that there may not be
an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in such an event, a party may seek and
obtain preliminary and permanent injunctive relief (without the necessity of
posting any bond or undertaking). Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative
and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party
may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

         8.20 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original, but all of which
together shall constitute the same instrument.

         8.21 Actions Simultaneous. All actions to be taken and all documents to
be executed and delivered by all parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have
been taken and executed and delivered simultaneously and no actions shall be
deemed to have been taken nor shall any documents be deemed to have been
executed and delivered until all actions have been taken and all documents have
been executed and delivered.
