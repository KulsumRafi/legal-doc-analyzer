                             AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING NOTE



             $40,000,000.00         Houston, Texas                 March 1, 2002

                      On the dates hereinafter prescribed, for value received,
              ULTRA RESOURCES, INC., a Wyoming corporation, (herein called
              "Borrower"), having an address at 16801 Greenspoint Park, Suite
              370, Houston, Texas 77060, promises to pay to the order of BANK
              ONE, NA (herein called "Bank"), at its principal offices at 910
              Travis, 6th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, (i) the principal amount
              of U.S. FORTY MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($40,000,000.00) or the
              principal amount advanced pursuant to the terms of the Credit
              Agreement (defined herein) as of the date of maturity hereof,
              whether by acceleration or otherwise, whichever may be the
              lesser, and (ii) interest on the principal balance from time to
              time advanced and remaining unpaid from the date of the advance
              until maturity at a rate of interest equal to lesser of (a) the
              "Floating Rate" (as defined and calculated in the Credit
              Agreement), or (b) the Maximum Rate (as defined and calculated in
              the Credit Agreement). Any increase or decrease in interest rate
              resulting from a change in the Maximum Rate shall be effective
              immediately when such change becomes effective, without notice to
              the Borrower, unless Applicable Law (as defined in the Credit
              Agreement) requires that such increase or decrease not be
              effective until a later time, in which event such increase or
              decrease shall be effective at the earliest time permitted under
              the provisions of such law.

                       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any period the
              Floating Rate exceeds the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest in
              effect on this Note shall be limited to the Maximum Rate during
              each such period, but at all times thereafter the rate of
              interest in effect on this Note shall be the Maximum Rate or, if
              there is no Maximum Rate, the Agreed Maximum Rate (as defined
              below), until the total amount of interest accrued on this Note
              equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued
              hereon if the Floating Rate had at all times been in effect.

                      This Note is a revolving credit note and it is
              contemplated that by reason of prepayments hereon there may be
              times when no indebtedness is owing hereunder; but
              notwithstanding such occurrence, this Note shall remain valid and
              in full force and effect as to each principal advance made
              hereunder subsequent to each such occurrence. Each principal
              advance and each payment hereof made pursuant to this Note shall
              be reflected by the Bank's records and the aggregate unpaid
              amounts reflected by such records shall constitute rebuttably
              presumptive evidence of the principal and unpaid, accrued
              interest remaining outstanding on this Note.

                      "Agreed Maximum Rate" means a per annum rate of seven and
              three-fourths percent (7.75%) plus the Floating Rate from time to
              time in effect, which Agreed Maximum Rate shall apply only during
              any period while there is no Maximum Rate applicable to this Note.

                      Other capitalized terms used herein, that are not defined
              herein, shall have the meanings prescribed therefor in the Credit
              Agreement.


                                                             -------------------
                                                             Borrower's Initials

<PAGE>



                  The Borrower and the Bank hereby agree that Chapter 346 of the
         Texas Finance Code, shall not apply to this Note or the loan
         transaction evidenced by, and referenced in, the Credit Agreement
         (hereinafter defined) in any manner, including without limitation, to
         any account or arrangement evidenced or created by, or provided for in,
         this Note.

                  The principal sum of this Note, after giving credit for
         unadvanced principal, if any, remaining at final maturity, shall be due
         and payable on or before March 1, 2005; interest to accrue upon the
         principal sum from time to time owing and unpaid hereunder shall be due
         and payable as provided in the Credit Agreement; provided, however, the
         final installment of interest hereunder shall be due and payable not
         later than the maturity of the principal sum hereof, howsoever such
         maturity may be brought about.

                  In no event shall the aggregate of the interest on this Note,
         plus any other amounts paid in connection with the loan evidenced by
         this Note which would under Applicable Law be deemed "interest," ever
         exceed the maximum amount of interest which, under Applicable Law,
         could be lawfully charged on this Note. The Bank and the Borrower
         specifically intend and agree to limit contractually the interest
         payable on this Note to not more than an amount determined at the
         Maximum Rate. Therefore, none of the terms of this Note or any other
         instruments pertaining to or securing this Note shall ever be construed
         to create a contract to pay interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum
         Rate, and neither the Borrower nor any other party liable herefor shall
         ever be liable for interest in excess of that determined at the Maximum
         Rate, and the provisions of this paragraph shall control over all
         provisions of this Note or of any other instruments pertaining to or
         securing this Note. If any amount of interest taken or received by the
         Bank shall be in excess of the maximum amount of interest which, under
         Applicable Law, could lawfully have been collected on this Note, then
         the excess shall be deemed to have been the result of a mathematical
         error by the parties hereto and shall be refunded promptly to the
         Borrower. All amounts paid or agreed to be paid in connection with the
         indebtedness evidenced by this Note which would under Applicable Law be
         deemed "interest" shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be
         amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of
         this Note.

                      AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING NOTE

$37,500,000.00                    Houston, Texas                   March 1, 2002

         On the dates hereinafter prescribed, for value received, ULTRA
RESOURCES, INC., a Wyoming corporation, (herein called "Borrower"), having an
address at 16801 Greenspoint Park, Suite 370, Houston, Texas 77060, promises to
pay to the order of UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA, N.A. (herein called "Bank"), at
its principal offices at 500 North Akard, Suite 4200, Dallas, Texas 75201, (i)
the principal amount of U.S. THIRTY SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND
NO/100 DOLLARS ($37,500,000.00) or the principal amount advanced pursuant to the
terms of the Credit Agreement (defined herein) as of the date of maturity hereof
whether by acceleration or otherwise, whichever may be the lesser, and (ii)
interest on the principal balance from time to time advanced and remaining
unpaid from the date of the advance until maturity at a rate of interest equal
to lesser of (a) the "Floating Rate" (as defined and calculated in the Credit
Agreement), or (b) the Maximum Rate (as defined and calculated in the Credit
Agreement). Any increase or decrease in interest rate resulting from a change in
the Maximum Rate shall be effective immediately when such change becomes
effective, without notice to the Borrower, unless Applicable Law (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) requires that such increase or decrease not be effective
until a later time, in which event such increase or decrease shall be effective
at the earliest time permitted under the provisions of such law.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any period the Floating Rate
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate during each such period, but at all times thereafter
the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be the Maximum Rate or, if
there is no Maximum Rate, the Agreed Maximum Rate (as defined below), until the
total amount of interest accrued on this Note equals the total amount of
interest which would have accrued hereof if the Floating Rate had at all times
been in effect.

         This Note is a revolving credit note and it is contemplated that by
reason of prepayments hereon there may be times when no indebtedness is owing
hereunder; but notwithstanding such occurrence, this Note shall remain valid and
in full force and effect as to each principal advance made hereunder subsequent
to each such occurrence. Each principal advance and each payment hereof made
pursuant to this Note shall be reflected by the Bank's records and the aggregate
unpaid amounts reflected by such records shall constitute rebuttably presumptive
evidence of the principal and unpaid, accrued interest remaining outstanding on
this Note.

         "Agreed Maximum Rate" means a per annum rate of seven and three-fourths
percent (7.75%) plus the Floating Rate from time to time in effect, which Agreed
Maximum Rate shall apply only during any period while there is no Maximum Rate
applicable to this Note.

         Other capitalized terms used herein, that are not defined herein, shall
have the meanings prescribed therefor in the Credit Agreement.

         The Borrower and the Bank hereby agree that Chapter 346 of the Texas
Finance Code, shall not apply to this Note or the loan transaction evidenced by,
and referenced in, the Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined) in any manner,
including without limitation, to any account or arrangement evidenced or created
by, or provided for in, this Note.

         The principal sum of this Note, after giving credit for unadvanced
principal, if any, remaining at final maturity, shall be due and payable on or
before March 1, 2005; interest to accrue upon the principal sum from time to
time owing and unpaid hereunder shall be due and payable as provided in the
Credit Agreement; provided, however, the final installment of interest hereunder
shall be due and payable not later than the maturity of the principal sum
hereof, howsoever such maturity may be brought about.

         In no event shall the aggregate of the interest on this Note, plus any
other amounts paid in connection with the loan evidenced by this Note which
would under Applicable Law be deemed "interest," ever exceed the maximum amount
of interest which, under Applicable Law, could be lawfully charged on this Note.
The Bank and the Borrower specifically intend and agree to limit contractually
the interest payable on this Note to not more than an amount determined at the
Maximum Rate. Therefore, none of the terms of this Note or any other instruments
pertaining to or securing this Note shall ever be construed to create a contract
to pay interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate, and neither the
Borrower nor any other party liable herefor shall ever be liable for interest in
excess of that determined at the Maximum Rate, and the provisions of this
paragraph shall control over all provisions of this Note or of any other
instruments pertaining to or securing this Note. If any amount of interest taken
or received by the Bank shall be in excess of the maximum amount of interest
which, under Applicable Law, could lawfully have been collected on this Note,
then the excess shall be deemed to have been the result of a mathematical error
by the parties hereto and shall be refunded promptly to the Borrower. All
amounts paid or agreed to be paid in connection with the indebtedness evidenced
by this Note which would under Applicable Law be deemed "interest" shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of this Note.

         This Note is secured by all security agreements, collateral
assignments, mortgages and lien instruments executed by the Borrower (or by any
other party) in favor of Bank One, NA, as Administrative Agent for the Banks,
including those executed simultaneously herewith, those executed heretofore and
those hereafter executed, and including specifically and without limitation the
Security Instruments described and defined in that certain Credit Agreement

and Bank One, Texas, National Association, as amended by that certain First
Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of July 19, 2001 by and between Borrower

Restated Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2002, as amended by the First Amendment
thereto dated November 4, 2002, by and among Borrower, Bank One, NA, as the

of or any interest on this Note, or in the event of default under the terms of
the Credit Agreement or any of the Security Instruments, or if any event occurs
or condition exists which authorizes the acceleration of the maturity of this
Note under any agreement made by the Borrower, the Bank (or other holder of this
Note) may, at its option, without presentment or demand or any notice to the
Borrower or any other person liable herefor, declare the unpaid principal
balance of and accrued interest on this Note to be immediately due and payable.

Court, or any judicial proceeding, or if this Note is not paid at maturity,
however such maturity may be brought about, and is placed in the hands of an

documented attorneys' fees, not to exceed 10% of the full amount of principal
and interest owing hereon at the time this Note is placed in the hands of an

                      AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING NOTE

$37,500,000.00                   Houston, Texas                   March 1, 2002


     On the dates hereinafter prescribed, for value received, ULTRA RESOURCES,
INC., a Wyoming corporation, (herein called "Borrower"), having an address at
16801 Greenspoint Park, Suite 370, Houston, Texas 77060, promises to pay to the
order of GUARANTY BANK, FSB (herein called "Bank"), at its principal offices at
333 Clay Street, Suite 4430, Houston, Texas 77002, (i) the principal amount of
U.S. THIRTY SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($37,500,000.00) or the principal amount advanced pursuant to the terms of the
Credit Agreement (defined herein) as of the date of maturity hereof, whether by
acceleration or otherwise, whichever may be the lesser, and (ii) interest on the
principal balance from time to time advanced and remaining unpaid from the date
of the advance until maturity at a rate of interest equal to lesser of (a) the
"Floating Rate" (as defined and calculated in the Credit Agreement), or (b) the
Maximum Rate (as defined and calculated in the Credit Agreement). Any increase
or decrease in interest rate resulting from a change in the Maximum Rate shall
be effective immediately when such change becomes effective, without notice to
the Borrower, unless Applicable Law (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
requires that such increase or decrease not be effective until a later time, in
which event such increase or decrease shall be effective at the earliest time
permitted under the provisions of such law.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any period the Floating Rate
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate during each such period, but at all times thereafter
the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be the Maximum Rate or, if
there is no Maximum Rate, the Agreed Maximum Rate (as defined below), until the
total amount of interest accrued on this Note equals the total amount of
interest which would have accrued hereon if the Floating Rate had at all times
been in effect.

         This Note is a revolving credit note and it is contemplated that by
reason of prepayments hereon there may be times when no indebtedness is owing
hereunder; but notwithstanding such occurrence, this Note shall remain valid and
in full force and effect as to each principal advance made hereunder subsequent
to each such occurrence. Each principal advance and each payment hereof made
pursuant to this Note shall be reflected by the Bank's records and the aggregate
unpaid amounts reflected by such records shall constitute rebuttably presumptive
evidence of the principal and unpaid, accrued interest remaining outstanding on
this Note.

         "Agreed Maximum Rate" means a per annum rate of seven and three-fourths
percent (7.75%) plus the Floating Rate from time to time in effect, which Agreed
Maximum Rate shall apply only during any period while there is no Maximum Rate
applicable to this Note.

         Other capitalized terms used herein, that are not defined herein, shall
have the meanings prescribed therefor in the Credit Agreement.

         The Borrower and the Bank hereby agree that Chapter 346 of the Texas
Finance Code, shall not apply to this Note or the loan transaction evidenced by,
and referenced in, the Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined) in any manner,
including without limitation, to any account or arrangement evidenced or created
by, or provided for in, this Note.

         The principal sum of this Note, after giving credit for unadvanced
principal, if any, remaining at final maturity, shall be due and payable on or
before March 1, 2005; interest to accrue upon the principal sum from time to
time owing and unpaid hereunder shall be due and payable as provided in the
Credit Agreement; provided, however, the final installment of interest hereunder
shall be due and payable not later than the maturity of the principal sum
hereof, howsoever such maturity may be brought about.

         In no event shall the aggregate of the interest on this Note, plus any
other amounts paid in connection with the loan evidenced by this Note which
would under Applicable Law be deemed "interest," ever exceed the maximum amount
of interest which, under Applicable Law, could be lawfully charged on this Note.
The Bank and the Borrower specifically intend and agree to limit contractually
the interest payable on this Note to not more than an amount determined at the
Maximum Rate. Therefore, none of the terms of this Note or any other instruments
pertaining to or securing this Note shall ever be construed to create a contract
to pay interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate, and neither the
Borrower nor any other party liable herefor shall ever be liable for interest in
excess of that determined at the Maximum Rate, and the provisions of this
paragraph shall control over all provisions of this Note or of any other
instruments pertaining to or securing this Note. If any amount of interest taken
or received by the Bank shall be in excess of the maximum amount of interest
which, under Applicable Law, could lawfully have been collected on this Note,
then the excess shall be deemed to have been the result of a mathematical error
by the parties hereto and shall be refunded promptly to the Borrower. All
amounts paid or agreed to be paid in connection with the indebtedness evidenced
by this Note which would under Applicable Law be deemed "interest" shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of this Note.

         This Note is secured by all security agreements, collateral
assignments, mortgages and lien instruments executed by the Borrower (or by any
other party) in favor of Bank One, NA, as Administrative Agent for the Banks,
including those executed simultaneously herewith, those executed heretofore and
those hereafter executed, and including specifically and without limitation the
Security Instruments described and defined in that certain Credit Agreement
dated as of March 22, 2000 by and between Borrower, Ultra Petroleum (USA) Inc.,
and Bank One, Texas, National Association, as amended by that certain First
Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of July 19, 2001 by and between Borrower
and Bank One, NA, and as amended and restated by that certain First Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement dated March 1, 2002, as amended by the First Amendment
thereto dated November 4, 2002, by and among Borrower, Bank One, NA, as the
Administrative Agent, as a Bank and as LC Issuer, and the several other banks
and financial institutions who are from time to time party thereto as Banks (as
may be further amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement").

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any period the Floating Rate
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate during each such period, but at all times thereafter
the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be the Maximum Rate or, if
