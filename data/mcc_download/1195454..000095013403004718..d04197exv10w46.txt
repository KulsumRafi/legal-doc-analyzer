                  termination liability associated with Local Access, Off-Net
                  InterLATA Service, or any other Third Party provided Service
                  including those of an SBCS LEC Affiliate. These Third Party
                  charges shall be charged [***** *******************]. The
                  Parties agree that the actual damages in the event of such
                  disconnection would be difficult or impossible to ascertain,
                  and that the disconnection charge in this Section 8.1 is
                  intended, therefore, to establish liquidated damages and is
                  not intended as a penalty.

                           8.1.1 Williams will use commercially reasonable
                  efforts to notify SBCS on a monthly basis of all circuits with
                  a Minimum Term or renewal term which will expire within ninety
                  (90) days. If SBCS does not notify Williams of its intent to
                  disconnect or renew such circuits within such ninety 90 day
                  period, Williams will continue to provide such Service on a
                  month to month basis at the then existing rate applicable to
                  such circuit for sixty (60) days. If SBCS does not notify
                  Williams of its intent to disconnect or renew the circuit with
                  such sixty (60) day period, the circuit will renew for a one
                  year Minimum Term at the applicable one year rate.

                           8.2. Minimum Terms. The minimum term associated with
                  each non-voice Service will be as set forth on the Service
                  Order (the "Minimum Term"). SBCS may order non-voice Services
                  that have a monthly, a one year, or a three year Minimum Term.
                  If no Minimum Term is specified on the Service Order, the
                  Minimum Term shall be one year."

approving and authorizing WCG's and CG Austria's entering into and performing
the Stipulation; and (iv) the Plan of Reorganization shall not have been
modified or amended in any manner that would affect SBC or that would alter the
Plan of Reorganization in any material respect without the express prior written
consent of SBC, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (except that the Plan
of Reorganization may be amended as set forth in Exhibit D to the Stipulation
without further consent from SBC). The Parties each acknowledge and agree that
the amendments and provisions set forth in Sections 1 and 2 above are not
effective until the conditions subsequent set forth in clauses (i) through (iv)
in this Section 3 have been satisfied or waived in writing by SBC. Subject to
the immediately following sentence, in the event that any of these conditions
subsequent shall fail to have been satisfied or waived by SBC in writing on or
before October 14, 2002 (subject to extension as set forth below), then this
Amendment No. 3 shall be null and void, ab initio, and the Parties shall be
restored to their respective rights and obligations as in existence immediately
prior to the Stipulation Date. In the event that Section 4.2 of the Plan of
Reorganization is amended to extend the date of October 14, 2002 to a later date
(but no later than November 14, 2002 except as provided in the immediately
following sentence), this Section 3 shall automatically (without any action of

October 14, 2002 herein are replaced with reference to the date in Section 4.2

amendment will be effective if, at the time of such amendment to the Plan of
Reorganization, the Investment Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement or the TWC
Settlement Agreement (as such terms are defined in the Plan of Reorganization)
shall have been terminated. In the event that all of the conditions subsequent
set forth in this Section 3 shall have been satisfied on or before November 14,
2002, except that the Effective Date shall not have occurred and none of the
Investment Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement or the TWC Settlement
Agreement shall have been terminated, then this Amendment No. 3 shall not
