<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Base Salary</U>. Employee shall be paid a base salary (the &#147;Base Salary&#148;)
at an annual rate of $105,000, payable at such intervals as the other executive
officers of the Company are paid, but in any event at least on a monthly basis.
On each January 1 following the Commencement Date, commencing January&nbsp;1, 2003,
Base Salary shall be increased annually by no less than 4% over the immediately
preceding year&#146;s Base Salary.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Bonus Compensation</U>. Employee shall receive bonus compensation (&#147;Bonus
Compensation&#148;) in accordance with paragraph (i)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4(b); provided,
however, that if at any time the Management Bonus (as hereinafter defined) is
not in effect, Employee shall receive bonus compensation in accordance with
paragraph (ii)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4(b). Employee shall not be entitled to
participate in any incentive bonus program for non-management level employees
during the time the Management Bonus is in effect.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Management Bonus</U>. The performance of the business shall be reviewed
at the end of each operating year and compared to such goals as are set forth
in the business plan for that year as approved by the Board (the &#147;Business
Plan&#148;). If the results of operations for the year achieve the net
profitability goals for the year specified in the approved Business Plan, a
bonus equal to no less than 25% of the Employee&#146;s Base Salary shall be paid to
him (the &#147;Management Bonus&#148;). If the results of operations for the year exceed
the net profitability goals of the approved Business Plan, the amount of the
Employee&#146;s Management Bonus may be increased in recognition of the degree to
which performance exceeded such goals, and the Employee&#146;s contribution to such
superior performance results as determined in the sole discretion of the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the &#147;Committee&#148;). If the results of
operations for the year fail to achieve such net profitability goals, the
amount, if any of the Employee&#146;s Management Bonus shall be within the absolute
discretion of the Committee, provided that the Committee shall give reasonable
consideration to any intervening or extraordinary events or circumstances that
might have given rise to such shortfall.

addition to the Base Salary, Employee shall be entitled to such bonus
compensation as may be determined from time to time by the Committee, in its
sole discretion. The Committee shall base its decision on a review of the
performance of the Company and the Employee&#146;s performance at the end of each
year.

with pay during each calendar year of his Employment hereunder consistent with
his position as an executive officer of the Company, but in no event less than
four weeks in any such calendar year (pro-rated as necessary for partial
calendar years during the Term). Such vacation may be taken, in Employee&#146;s
discretion, at such time or times as are not inconsistent with the reasonable
business needs of the Company. Employee shall not be entitled to any
additional compensation in the event that Employee, for whatever reason, fails
to take such vacation during any year of his Employment hereunder. Employee

officers&#146; liability insurance policy then in effect for the Company or any of
its affiliates as to which Employee is serving as a director or officer. The

Employee&#146;s Employment hereunder shall be terminated as of the date of his death
and Employee&#146;s designated beneficiary, or, in the absence of such designation,
the estate or other legal representative of Employee (collectively, the
&#147;Estate&#148;), shall be paid Employee&#146;s unpaid Base Salary through the month in
which the death occurs and any unpaid Bonus Compensation for any fiscal year
which has ended as of the date of such termination or which was at least fifty
percent (50%) completed as of the date of death. In the case of such
incomplete fiscal year, the Bonus Compensation shall be determined based upon
the assumption that Employee would have earned the target Bonus Compensation in
accordance with Section&nbsp;4(b) and pro-rated, and all such Bonus Compensation, if
any, payable as a result of this Section&nbsp;8(a) shall be payable at the same time
as bonuses would be payable to other executive officers (regardless of whether
such other officers earned any such bonus). The Estate shall be entitled to
all other death benefits in accordance with the terms of the Company&#146;s benefit
programs and plans.

the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving Employee
30&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice. Any determination of Disability shall be made
by the Board in its reasonable good faith discretion. If Employee&#146;s Employment
hereunder is so terminated, Employee shall be paid, offset by payments under
any disability insurance policy in effect, Employee&#146;s unpaid Base Salary
through the month in which the termination occurs, plus Bonus Compensation on
the same basis as is set forth in Section&nbsp;8(a) above. The Employee shall be
entitled to receive all benefits in accordance with the terms of this Agreement

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from terminating Employee&#146;s
Employment for Cause (as hereinafter defined). From and after the Date of

make any of the certifications required of him as Chief Executive Officer of
the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;302 or Section&nbsp;906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, or any similar
requirements of any federal, state, local or foreign governmental authority or
agency, or of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which any
class or series of the Company&#146;s capital stock is then traded or listed for
quotation, constitute or give rise to a basis for termination for &#147;Cause.&#148;

8(c) and specifying the particular act or acts on the basis of which the Board
intends to terminate Employee&#146;s Employment. Employee shall then be given the
opportunity, within 15&nbsp;days of his receipt of such notice, to have a meeting
with the Board to discuss such act or acts (other than with respect to an
action described in Sections&nbsp;8(c)(i)(A) or (B)&nbsp;above as to which the Board may
immediately terminate Employee&#146;s Employment for Cause). Other than with
respect to an action described in Sections&nbsp;8(c)(i)(A) or (B)&nbsp;above, Employee
shall be given seven days after his meeting with the Board to take reasonable
steps to cease or correct the performance (or nonperformance) giving rise to
such Notice of Termination. In the event the Board determines that Employee
has failed within such seven-day period to take reasonable steps to cease or
correct such performance (or nonperformance), Employee shall be given the
opportunity, within 10&nbsp;days of his receipt of written notice to such effect, to
have a meeting with the Board to discuss such determination. Following that
meeting, if the Board believes that Employee has failed to take reasonable
steps to cease or correct his performance (or nonperformance) as above
described, the Board may thereupon terminate the Employment of Employee for
Cause.
