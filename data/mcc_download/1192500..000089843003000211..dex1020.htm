such information confidentially and shall agree to abide by these provisions. All obligations of Broker under this Section 31 shall be deemed to be applicable to Broker and to all Representatives of Broker, all Broker Affiliates, and all

approximate revenues, purposes and expectations related to such relationship and a description of any disputes relating thereto and Broker provides Owner with advanced written notice of such potential disclosure so that Owner has a reasonable
opportunity to secure the confidential protections thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, <B>&#147;Confidential Information&#148;</B> means all confidential and proprietary information, currently existing or subsequently created during the term of
