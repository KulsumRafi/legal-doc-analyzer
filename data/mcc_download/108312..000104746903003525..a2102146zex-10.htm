<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into as of November&nbsp;20, 2002 by and between Woodward Governor Company, a Delaware corporation, (hereinafter called the
"Corporation") and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(hereinafter called the "Executive"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>WITNESSETH
THAT: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to assure that the Corporation
will have the continued dedication of the Executive, despite the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Corporation; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board believes that it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive which would result from the personal uncertainties and risks created by a
threatened or pending Change in Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the business of the Corporation currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change
in Control and to provide the Executive with appropriate compensation and benefit protection upon a Change in Control; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Executive, each intending to be legally bound, hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall become effective upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in
Paragraph&nbsp;4(d), below) (hereinafter called the "Effective Date") and shall remain in effect for a term continuing until the end of the twenty-fourth (24th) calendar month following the month in
which the Effective Date occurs; provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change in Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the
Corporation was terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (a)&nbsp;was at the
request of a third party who was taking steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (b)&nbsp;otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change in Control, then for all
purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Effective Date, the Corporation shall employ the Executive to, and the Executive shall,
exercise such authority and perform such executive duties as are commensurate with the authority being exercised and performed by the Executive during the ninety-day period immediately
prior to the Effective Date, which services shall be performed at the location where the Executive was employed immediately prior to the Effective Date. The Executive shall also continue to serve as a
member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, if serving as such as of the Effective Date. The Executive shall devote substantially his entire time during reasonable business hours (reasonable
sick leave and vacations excepted) and reasonable best efforts to fulfill faithfully and responsibly his duties hereunder. During the period of employment after the Effective Date, it shall not be a
violation of this Agreement for the Executive to serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, or be involved in civic, charitable or educational endeavors, or manage personal
investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Corporation hereunder. It is expressly agreed and
understood that to the extent any such activities were conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such or similar activities subsequent to the Effective Date
shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

to the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;(c), below, all determinations required to be made under this Paragraph&nbsp;7, including whether and when a
Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
by the accounting firm which is then serving as the auditors for the Corporation (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Executive
within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation. In the event that the
Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make
the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the
Corporation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;7, shall be paid by the Corporation to the Executive within five (5)&nbsp;days of the receipt of the
Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the
Excise Tax on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any good faith determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the Corporation and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm
hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be
made hereunder. In the event that the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(c), below, and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the
Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive. </FONT></P>
