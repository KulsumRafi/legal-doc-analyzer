and

3)       FX Energy Inc. having its seat in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA at Highland
         Drive No. 3006 suite 206 ("FX USA"), acting as a surety for FX's
         obligations arising from this Agreement.

PREAMBULA:

A)       The Parties hereto have reached an agreement on all issues regarding
         conducting of their joint operations within the Fences area that were
         subject of discussions between the Parties and have concluded by
         signing the Settlement Agreement regarding the Fences area on this day.

B)       The Parties desire to conduct joint operations within an additional
         area described in detail in Appendix 1 (the ,,Poznan" area), on the
         similar principles as within the Fences area;

C)       The Parties desire to set forth the basic principles for their
         cooperation within the Poznan area.


Therefore, the Parties hereby have agreed as follows:

              Basic Parties' obligations and transaction documents

1.1      Subject as stated below, the Parties' initial interests in all rights
         and obligations within the Poznan area shall be as follows:

         - 51% POGC
         - 49% FX

<PAGE>

1.2      In exchange for the information and knowledge obtained by POGC as a
         result of geological work conducted within the Poznan area (either
         solely or jointly with other parties), FX commits to finance 100% costs
         of joint exploration operations until the sum of such costs reach USD 4
         million. The USD 4 million shall be spent by FX by December 31, 2004,
         in accordance with work programs and budgets approved pursuant to the
         Poznan JOA (defined below). The above commitment is in addition to and
         independent from FX commitments resulting from the Settlement Agreement
         regarding the Fences Area dated ___________, between POGC and FX

1.3      FX confirms that it is aware of the fact that POGC conducted certain
         exploration work jointly with Conoco and Ruhrgas within the Poznan
         Area, which did not result in any commercial discovery.

1.4      Operations within the Poznan Area shall be conducted pursuant to a
         joint operating agreement (the "Poznan JOA"), the detailed provisions
         of which both Parties shall negotiate promptly in good faith and which
         both Parties shall sign no later than 30 days from the date hereof. The
         Poznan JOA shall be substantially in the same form and content as the
         respective agreement regarding the Fences JOA (as amended), and shall
         reflect the following basic terms:

         a)       the Parties interests in all rights, assets, obligations and
                  liabilities arising under joint operations shall be 51% POGC
                  and 49% FX and such interest structure shall be binding from
                  the date of conclusion of the Poznan JOA;
         b)       FX shall cover the cost of initial joint exploration work up
                  to 4 mln USD, in consideration of the work performed by POGC
                  within the Poznan area that resulted in obtaining geological
                  information which POGC shall make available to FX;
         c)       all decisions of the Operating Committee shall require a 2/3
                  majority;
         d)       unless mutually decided otherwise, the Parties shall not form
                  any company or a partnership for the purposes of conduction of
                  works within the Poznan area.

                                    Article 2
                 Transfer of mining usufruct in the Poznan area

2.1      POGC and FX shall conclude an agreement (the "Transfer Agreement"),
         substantially consistent with the form set forth in Appendix 2 hereto
         relating to transfer to FX a 49% interest in each of the mining
         usufructs established on the concession areas comprising the Poznan
         area as described in Appendix 1, subject to FX having fulfilled its
         commitment to finance 100% of initial operations up to USD 4 million,
         as stated in Clause 1.2 above and subject to full performance by FX of
         all obligations under the Fences Settlement Agreement and subject to
         obtaining of all the required consents from the State Treasury, which
         POGC shall promptly apply for and shall make best efforts to obtain as
         soon as possible. The Transfer Agreement shall be concluded
         concurrently with this Agreement and shall state that the effect of
         disposal concerning the transfer of the mining usufruct shall occur as
         of the moment of FX accomplishment of the obligations set out in Clause
         1.2 or granting the appropriate security for their accomplishment.

2.2      All administrative cost and taxes connected with the transfer of rights
         pursuant to the Transfer Agreement shall be paid by FX. FX shall be
         responsible for filing the appropriate tax return. Other costs related
         to the mining usufruct shall be covered from the Joint Account in
         accordance with the Poznan JOA.

<PAGE>

2.3      Should the State Treasury refuse its consent for the mining usufruct
         transfer, the Parties shall act diligently to find ways of alternative
         securing FX direct rights to 49% of benefits produced by the joint
         operations within the Poznan area.

2.4.     Together with the rights of the mining usufruct and without a separate
         compensation, POGC shall transfer to FX a 49% ownership interest in all
         geological data regarding the Poznan area owned by POGC, subject to
         obtaining the required consent of the Minister of Environment. Other
         provisions of this Article 2 shall apply to the geological data mutatis
         mutandis.

                                    Article 3
                           Detailed financial matters

For the purposes of calculating any US Dollar equivalent of any amounts to be
paid in Polish Zloty (or vice versa), the average exchange rate published by the
National Bank of Poland on the day the payment is made (i.e. the appropriate
amount is received by the payee), shall be applied.

         2004, POGC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by a 90-day
         written notice to FX, with the reservation that the effect of
         termination shall not occur if FX fulfils all its obligations within
         the notice period.

5.2.     If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Clause 5.1, the Poznan JOA
         will nevertheless remain in effect with respect to aerial extent of any
         prospects structures mapped and drilled within the frame work of the

         concessions. (The prospect aerial extent shall be delineated by the
         lowest closing contour or by the bottom of a defined hydrocarbon
         contact determined by a well penetration, whichever is deeper). Subject
         to the above, promptly following the termination of this Agreement, FX
         shall transfer its interest in the usufruct(s) established within the
