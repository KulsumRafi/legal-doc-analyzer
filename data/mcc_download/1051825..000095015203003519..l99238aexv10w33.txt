business at 5350 Lakeview Parkway South Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46268 ("CART")
and Patrick Racing, Inc. 8431 Georgetown Rd., Suite 400, Indianapolis, IN 46268

     WHEREAS, CART has sanctioned the Bridgestone Presents the Champ Car World
Series Powered by Ford ("Championship Series") in 2003 ("Race Year");

     WHEREAS, CART desires to induce TEAM to enter a race car (car #20)
exclusively in the Championship Series in the Race Year and TEAM is interested
in entering a race car upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, CART desires to obtain endorsement and promotional services, and
TEAM is willing to advertise and promote the Championship Series on the terms
and conditions hereafter set forth; and

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to establish a mutually beneficial relationship
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set
forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

      1. TEAM shall prepare and enter and expend its best efforts to qualify and
         race one (1) race car exclusively in the Championship Series, in all of
         the races in the Race Year.

      2. In consideration for TEAM's agreement to race in each of the races, and
         in consideration of TEAM's providing promotional benefits through
         advertising on the race car and other below enumerated promotional
         services, CART agrees to pay TEAM the sum of One Million Four Hundred
         Thousand ($1,400,000.00) Dollars during the 2003 race season. The
         payments will be made in nineteen (19) equal installments. The payments
         shall be made during the week following each of the races in the race
         season. If there are less than nineteen (19) races in the race season,
         the monies remaining after the last race of the season shall be paid in
         a lump sum.

      3. TEAM understands that the payment of the funds set forth in paragraph 2

         funding to field a team during the Race year. In the event that TEAM
         receives sponsorship revenue that totals more than Seven Million
         ($7,000,000.00) Dollars net (less commissions), TEAM will reimburse
