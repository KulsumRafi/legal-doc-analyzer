     sheet with respect to the Net Book Value (the "PRE-CLOSING BALANCE SHEET")
     which shall (1) be as of a date not more than five (5) Business Days prior
     to the Closing Date, (2) contain the same line item categories as those
     contained in the form of the balance sheet attached in ANNEX A hereto and
     the balance sheet dated September 30, 2002 (other than the line item
     "Investments"), which has been previously provided by Sellers to Purchasers
     and is attached hereto as SECTION 1.04(C)(I)(A)(I)(2) OF THE DISCLOSURE
     SCHEDULE (the "SEPTEMBER BALANCE Sheet"), (3) be prepared from the Business
     Books and Records and in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to
     time, applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements,
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pre-Closing
     Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the valuation principles
     set forth in ANNEX A hereto (together, the "ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES"), and
     (4) reflect no write-up of any individual asset of the Business which was
     included in the Financial Statements and is included in the Pre-Closing
     Balance Sheet to a book value greater than its book value in the Financial
     Statements, and (ii) a certificate of Sellers (the "PRE-CLOSING
     CERTIFICATE") setting forth thereon Sellers' good faith estimate of the Net
     Book Value as of the Closing Date (the "ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE"), which
     shall be derived from and supported by the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet.

               (B) As soon as practicable, and in no event later than 45 days
          following the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to
          Purchasers an audited balance sheet of the Net Book Value as of the
          Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET"), together with a
          certificate of Sellers (the "CLOSING DATE CERTIFICATE"), which shall
          set forth the Net Book Value as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE
          NET BOOK VALUE") as derived from and supported by the Closing Date
          Balance Sheet. Sellers and Purchasers shall split equally the expenses
          incurred by Sellers in the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
          Sheet. As part of the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
          Purchasers shall have the right to jointly conduct with Sellers a
          complete physical inventory of the Business as of the Closing Date and
          the results thereof shall be reflected in the Closing Date Balance
          Sheet. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (i) contain the same


                                       9


<PAGE>

          line item categories as those contained in the form of the balance
          sheet attached in ANNEX A hereto, the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and
          the September Balance Sheet and (ii) be prepared from the Business
          Books and Records and in accordance with the Accounting Principles
          used in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet. Purchasers
          and their independent public accountant ("PURCHASERS' ACCOUNTANT") may
          participate and observe the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
          Sheet. Sellers and their independent public accountant ("SELLERS'
          ACCOUNTANT") shall make all of their work papers and other relevant
          documents in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date
          Balance Sheet available to Purchasers and Purchasers' Accountant, and
          shall make the persons in charge of the preparation of the Closing
          Date Balance Sheet available for reasonable inquiry by Purchasers and
          Purchasers' Accountant.

               (C) Purchasers shall notify Sellers in writing as soon as
          practicable, and in no event more than 30 days, following receipt of
          the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Certificate if
          they do not agree with the Closing Date Net Book Value set forth
          thereon, in which case Purchasers and Purchasers' Accountant, on the
          one hand, and Sellers and Sellers' Accountant, on the other, will use
          good faith efforts during the thirty (30) day period following the
          date Sellers received such notice from Purchasers to resolve any
          differences they may have as to the Closing Date Net Book Value. Such
          written notice will identify with reasonable specificity the
          calculations with which Purchasers disagree or other bases for such
          disagreement. If Sellers and Purchasers cannot reach agreement during
          such thirty (30) day period, they shall submit their disagreements
          within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day
          period to an independent, nationally-recognized public accounting firm
          jointly selected by Sellers' Accountant and Purchasers' Accountant
          (the "INDEPENDENT Accountant"), which shall conduct such additional
          review as is necessary to resolve the specific disagreements referred
          to it and, based thereon, shall determine the Closing Date Net Book
          Value. The review of the Independent Accountant will be restricted as
          to scope to address only those matters as to which Sellers and
          Purchasers have not reached agreement pursuant to the preceding
          sentence. The Independent Accountant's determination of the Closing
          Date Net Book Value, which shall be completed as promptly as
          practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days following its
          selection, shall be confirmed by the Independent Accountant in writing
          to, and shall be final and binding on, each of Sellers and Purchasers
          for all purposes.

               (D) In the event that the Closing Date Net Book Value determined
          in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this SECTION 1.04(C),
          as the case may be (the "FINAL NET BOOK VALUE") is less than the
          Estimated Net Book Value (such difference being herein referred to as
          the "NET WORTH DEFICIENCY"), then Sellers shall, within three (3)
          Business Days following the date of determination of the Final Net
          Book Value (the "DETERMINATION DATE"), pay to Purchasers, if the
          amount of the Net Worth Deficiency exceeds the Holdback Amount, such
          excess amount and Purchasers shall retain the Holdback Amount;
          PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,


                                       10


<PAGE>

          if the amount of the Net Worth Deficiency is less than the Holdback
          Amount, Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the
          Determination Date, pay to Sellers, the amount equal to the Holdback
          Amount less the Net Worth Deficiency. In the event that the Final Net
          Book Value is greater than the Estimated Net Book Value (such
          difference being herein referred to as the "NET WORTH EXCESS"),
          Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the
          Determination Date, pay to Sellers the amount equal to the sum of the
          Net Worth Excess and the Holdback Amount. If the Final Net Book Value
          is equal to the Estimated Net Book Value, Purchasers shall, within
          three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to
          Sellers the Holdback Amount.

               (E) Daily interest shall accrue on the Holdback Amount from the
          Closing Date until the payment thereof at an annualized rate equal to
          four and one-half percent (4 1/2%). Interest shall be computed on the
          basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The
          interest so payable and the principal amount of the Holdback Amount
          shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
          such account as Sellers may direct by written notice delivered to
          Purchasers.

               (F) If the Closing Date Net Book Value as determined by the
          Independent Accountant is closer to the Closing Date Net Book Value
          advocated by (i) Sellers than it is to the Closing Date Net Book Value
          advocated by Purchasers, Purchasers shall pay the fees, costs and
          expenses of the Independent Accountant for services rendered pursuant
          to this Section or (ii) Purchasers than it is to the Closing Date Net
          Book Value advocated by Sellers, Sellers shall pay the fees, costs and
          expenses of the Independent Accountant for services rendered pursuant
          to this Section. Otherwise, such fees, costs and expenses shall be
          paid equally by Sellers and Purchasers.

               (G) If the sale of the GmbH Shares and/or the Canadian Assets
          does not occur on the Closing Date due to the failure to obtain the
          necessary approvals of the Cartel Office and/or the Competition Bureau
          (as the case may be) but such approval(s) are obtained prior to the
          Drop Dead Date, then at the subsequent closing of the sale of the GmbH
          Shares and/or the Canadian Assets (as the case may be), the parties
          shall apply the principals and adjustment mechanisms set forth in this
          SECTION 1.04 to the GmbH Shares and/or the Canadian Assets (as the
          case may be) to obtain the same result as if such sale(s) occurred on
          the Closing Date.

     1.05 CLOSING. (a) The Closing will take place at the offices of Milbank,
Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, NY, or at such
other place as Purchasers and Sellers mutually agree, at 10:00 A.M. local time,
on the Closing Date. At the Closing, Purchasers will pay the Closing Purchase
Price and the Canadian Purchase Price, less five percent (5%) of an amount equal
to the Closing Purchase Price plus the Canadian Purchase Price plus the GmbH
Purchase Price less the WPI Shares Purchase Price (the


                                       11


<PAGE>

"HOLDBACK AMOUNT"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
accounts as Sellers may reasonably direct by written notice delivered to
Purchasers by Sellers at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date.
Simultaneously, (a) each of Pioneer, Pioneer Illinois, Pioneer Minnesota, and
Pioneer LTD will assign and transfer to Arrow all of its right, title and
interest in and to the U.S. Assets and Pioneer Canada will assign and transfer
to Arrow Canada all of its right, title and interest in and to the Canadian
Assets (in each case, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens)
by delivery of (i) a General Assignment and Bill of Sale substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT A hereto (the "GENERAL ASSIGNMENT"), duly executed by the
applicable Seller, (ii) an assignment of the Intangible Personal Property, duly
executed by the applicable Seller, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the applicable Purchaser, (iii) an assignment of the Real Property Leases,
duly executed by the applicable Seller, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the applicable Purchaser, (iv) a Share Purchase and Transfer
Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT F hereto, duly executed by

sufficient instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Purchasers' counsel, as shall be effective to
vest in the applicable Purchaser good title to the applicable Assets as and to
the extent provided in SECTION 1.01(A) (the General Assignment and the other
instruments referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) being collectively referred to
herein as the "ASSIGNMENT INSTRUMENTS"); furthermore, Sellers will deliver to
Purchasers a copy of the Deed of Incorporation and the Minute Book of the GmbH
Subsidiary; (b) Arrow will assume from Pioneer, Pioneer Illinois, Pioneer
Minnesota, and Pioneer LTD the due payment, performance and discharge of the
U.S. Liabilities and Arrow Canada will assume from Pioneer Canada the due
payment, performance and discharge of the Canadian Liabilities by delivery of
(i) an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto (the
"ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"), duly executed by the applicable Purchaser, and (ii)
such other good and sufficient instruments of assumption, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Sellers' counsel, as shall be effective to cause the
applicable Purchaser to assume the applicable Assumed Liabilities as and to the
extent provided in SECTION 1.02(A) (the Assumption Agreement and such other
instruments referred to in clause (ii) being collectively referred to herein as
the "ASSUMPTION INSTRUMENTS"); and (c) if all of the WPI Necessary Approvals
have been obtained prior to the Closing, Pioneer will deliver to Arrow
certificates representing all of Pioneer's right, title and interest in and to
the WPI Shares, each such certificate to be duly and validly endorsed in favor
of Arrow or accompanied by a separate stock power duly and validly executed by
Pioneer with requisite stock transfer stamps, if any, and otherwise sufficient
to vest in the applicable Purchaser good and valid title in and to the WPI
Shares. At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to Sellers and Purchasers
the opinions, certificates and other contracts, documents and instruments
required to be delivered under ARTICLES VI and VII.

     (b) If all of the consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and
notices to, the Governmental or Regulatory Authorities specified in SECTION
2.14(A) OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, if any, necessary to vest in Arrow good and
valid title to the WPI Shares ("WPI NECESSARY APPROVALS"), have not been
obtained prior to the Closing, then Pioneer and Arrow shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain all the WPI Necessary Approvals by such date that is thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date (the "WPI DROP DEAD DATE"). If Pioneer and
Arrow are able to obtain all of the WPI Necessary Approvals by the WPI Drop Dead
Date, then, as promptly as


                                       12


<PAGE>

practicable after such date (the "WPI APPROVAL DATE") and at such place as
mutually agreed by Pioneer and Arrow: (i) Arrow shall pay the WPI Shares
Purchase Price to Pioneer and (ii) Pioneer shall deliver to Arrow Europe
certificates representing all of Pioneer's right, title and interest in and to
the WPI Shares. If Pioneer and Arrow are unable to obtain all of the WPI

     (c) In the event that at Closing all of the conditions precedent set forth
in Articles VI and VII have been satisfied or waived except that the parties
have not obtained the consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and
notices to, (i) the Cartel Office necessary to vest in Arrow Europe good and
valid title to the GmbH Shares and/or (ii) the Competition Bureau necessary to
vest in Arrow good and valid title to the Canadian Assets, then (A) the parties
will consummate the Closing without acquiring the GmbH Shares and/or (as the
case may be) the Canadian Assets and assuming the Canadian Liabilities, (B) the
Net Book Value of the GmbH Subsidiary and/or (as the case may be) of Pioneer
Canada will be excluded from the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Balance Sheet and (C) Pioneer and Arrow shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
such approvals from the Cartel Office and/or (as the case may be) the
Competition Bureau by such date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date
(the "DROP DEAD DATE"). If Pioneer and Arrow are able to obtain all of such
approvals from the Cartel Office by the Drop Dead Date, then, as promptly as
practicable after such date (the "GMBH APPROVAL DATE") and at such place as
mutually agreed by Pioneer and Arrow: (1) Arrow shall pay the GmbH Purchase
Price to Pioneer and (2) Pioneer shall deliver to Purchasers the executed Share
Purchase and Transfer Agreement and shall deliver such other documents and take
such other actions, if any, sufficient to vest in Arrow Europe good and valid
title in and to the GmbH Shares. If Pioneer and Arrow are unable to obtain all
of such approvals from the Cartel Office by the GmbH Drop Dead Date, then Arrow
shall not be obligated to purchase the GmbH Shares or pay the GmbH Purchase
Price to Pioneer. If Pioneer and Arrow are able to obtain all of such approvals

Price to Pioneer and assume the Canadian Liabilities and (2) Pioneer shall

obligated to purchase the Canadian Assets, assume the Canadian Liabilities or
pay the Canadian Purchase Price to Pioneer. If at the Closing Date the necessary
approvals of the Cartel Office with respect to the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the
Competition Office with respect to Pioneer Canada have not been obtained, the
commencement date for the provision of services under the Transition Services
Agreement with respect to the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the Canada Assets (as the
case may be) shall be deferred until the closing(s) of the sale of the GmbH
Subsidiary and/or the Canada Assets (as the case may be).

     1.06 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) SELECTED EMPLOYEES. (i) At or prior to Closing,
the Purchasers will extend offers of employment, commencing as of 12:01 a.m. on
the day following the Closing Date, at such salary, compensation levels and
terms and conditions as such Purchasers may determine, to the Selected
Employees, which offers shall be conditioned on the Closing. Each Selected
Employee who accepts Purchasers' offer of employment shall become an


                                       13


<PAGE>

employee of the Purchasers as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the Closing
Date and shall thereafter be a "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE". Purchasers shall assume
all employment obligations accruing or arising after such time with respect to
the Transferred Employees. In addition, Purchasers agree that in connection with
their employment of any Transferred Employees, such Purchasers shall (x) give
full credit for years of service with Sellers for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under Purchasers' Plans, (y) impose no waiting period for benefits
participation, and (z) impose no exclusions from health benefits for
pre-existing medical conditions, other than those medical conditions excluded
under Sellers' health plans.

          (ii) Subsequent to the Closing Date, Sellers, in their sole option,
     may retain or terminate any Employees other than the Transferred Employees,
     and Purchasers shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice
     from the Sellers setting forth the names of such terminated Employees and
     the amounts actually paid by the Sellers to or on behalf of such terminated
     Employees, reimburse Sellers for any severance payments actually paid by
     Sellers to or on behalf of any terminated Employees pursuant to the
     Severance Policy as a result of the Sellers' termination of such Employees
     (x) on the day of the Closing or at any time during the two-week period
     after the Closing Date, (y) a later date to comply with the WARN ACT, or
     (z) with respect to any Employees who are retained by Sellers to provide
     services under the Transition Services Agreement, on the day of termination
     of such Employees by Sellers provided, HOWEVER, that Purchasers shall not
     be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any severance payments made to any
     Selected Employees who are offered employment by Purchasers with
     substantially equivalent compensation and benefits, in the aggregate, to
     that currently being provided by Sellers to each such Selected Employee,
     and at the same work location or at a work location that is not more than
     fifty (50) miles from such location, and who do not accept the Purchasers'
     offer of employment; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Purchasers shall not be
     obligated to reimburse Sellers for any additional severance to any
     vice-presidents not required by the Severance Policy as listed on SECTION
     2.07 OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. To the extent Sellers terminate any
     employees after the Closing Date but before expiration of the two-week
     period following the Closing Date, Sellers shall be solely responsible for
     all employment obligations (other than severance, which shall be addressed
     in the manner described in this SECTION 1.06) accruing or arising with
     respect to such Employees during such time. Purchasers shall not be
     obligated to reimburse Sellers for any such severance payments to Employees
     terminated by Sellers after the time periods specified in clauses (x)
     through (z) above.

          (iii) In the event that Purchasers offer any Selected Employee
     employment that is not substantially equivalent in compensation and
     benefits, in the aggregate, to that currently being provided by Sellers to
     each such Selected Employee, or which involves a change in work location of
     fifty (50) or more miles, and any such Selected Employee declines such
     employment, Purchasers shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an
     invoice from Sellers setting forth the names of such Selected Employees and
     the amounts actually paid by Sellers to or on behalf of such Selected
     Employees, reimburse Sellers for any severance payments Sellers actually
     pay to or on behalf of such Selected Employees pursuant to the Severance
     Policy.

          (iv) Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Purchasers that the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not trigger any "change
     of control", as such term is defined in any employment agreement or change
     of control agreement with or relating to any Employees. In the event that
     any claim or demand is made in respect of which an Employee asserts against
     or seeks to be collected from any of Purchasers any payments or other
     benefits arising in connection with a "change of control", including,
     without limitation, as a result of any court of competent jurisdiction or
     other competent Governmental or Regulatory Authority determining that a
     "change of control" has occurred that would trigger any payments or other
     benefits, Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers for all
     costs and expenses incurred in defending and/or paying any such claim or
     demand and any Losses or Liabilities related thereto.

          (v) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any
     Transferred Employee any right to continued employment by any of
     Purchasers, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of
     Purchasers to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee, with or
     without cause, subject to applicable law. No provision of this Agreement
     shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Employee, or any
     beneficiary or dependents thereof.

          (vi) Sellers hereby waive, with respect to the solicitation of
     employment or employment by Purchasers of any Selected Employee, any claims
     or rights Sellers may have against Purchasers or any such Selected Employee
     under any non-hire, non-solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality or
     employment agreement or any cause of action based on similar rights arising
     by contract, at common law or by statute or regulation. Sellers hereby
     assign, to the extent legally permissible, to Purchasers all of Sellers'
     rights to enforce the provisions of any non-competition agreement between
     any of Sellers and any Transferred Employee and any non-hire,
     non-solicitation, confidentiality, assignment of inventions or similar
     agreement between such Sellers and any Transferred Employee.

          (vii) During the time that this Agreement shall remain in effect and
     for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, each of Sellers
     agree that it shall take no action, formal or informal, direct or indirect,
     to (A) solicit the employment of any Transferred Employees other than
     through general advertising not specifically directed at such employees,
     (B) hire any Transferred Employees of Purchasers, except as a result of
     actions permitted by clause (A) above, or (C) solicit, entice, induce or
     encourage any Transferred Employees or any other employee, consultant or
     independent contractor of Purchasers to terminate his, her or its
     relationship with any of Purchasers in order to become an employee of, or a
     consultant or independent contractor to, a person other than Purchasers;
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Sellers shall not be restricted from soliciting the
     employment of or hiring any Transferred Employees that have previously been
     terminated by Purchasers or have terminated their employment with
     Purchasers other than as a result of Sellers' violation of this SECTION
     1.06(A)(VII).

     (b) WARN ACT NOTICES. Sellers shall be responsible for providing any
notices required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(the "WARN ACT"), and


                                       15


<PAGE>

shall hold harmless and indemnify Purchasers from and against any liability or
damages resulting from Sellers' failure to comply with the WARN Act.

     (c) MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

          (i) Subject to the other provisions of SECTIONS 1.06(A)(I), (A)(II),
     (A)(III), and (C)(VI), Purchasers shall not assume any obligations to any
     Selected Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee, including,
     without limitation, any obligations or liabilities for any dismissal
     benefits, severance or restructuring costs, other than as required under
     the Severance Policy.

          (ii) Except as set forth in SECTION 1.06(A)(I), (A)(II) and (A)(III),
     and subject to the terms of SECTION 1.06(C)(VI), Purchasers shall not
     assume any obligations to any Employee, including any Transferred Employee,
     including, without limitation any wages (including salary and commissions),
     vacation pay (other than as provided in SECTION 1.02(A)(III)), severance
     pay, sick leave, medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan
     expenses and benefits of any type or nature, that accrued prior to the
     Closing Date.

          (iii) Purchasers are not assuming any of the Benefit Plans of any of
     the Sellers, and Purchasers shall have no liability whatsoever to employees
     of Sellers with respect to accrued or future benefits under any such
     Benefit Plans (other than as provided in SECTION 1.02(A)(III)), whether or
     not any of such employees are offered employment by, or become employees
     of, Purchasers, and Sellers shall defend, indemnify and hold Purchasers
     harmless against any claims that they have liability under such Benefit
     Plans.

          (IV) [Intentionally omitted.]

          (v) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchasers shall establish or designate
     one or more 401(k) defined contribution plans ("PURCHASERS' 401(K) PLAN")
     in which the Transferred Employees shall commence to participate on the day
     after the Closing Date. Purchasers shall permit any Transferred Employee
     who was covered under a 401(k) defined contribution plan of Sellers
     ("SELLERS' 401(K) PLAN") to elect a direct rollover of the Transferred
     Employee's rollover-eligible distribution (including any outstanding
     participant loan) from Sellers' 401(k) Plan to Purchasers' 401(k) Plan.

          (vi) Except as expressly limited by this Agreement, Purchasers
     acknowledge and assume sole and exclusive responsibility for all decisions
     and actions relating to Purchasers' employment of any Employees, including,
     but not limited to, any and all decisions to hire or not hire, job
     assignments, compensation, and benefits. Accordingly, Purchasers agree to
     indemnify and hold harmless Sellers for any and all liability(ies) arising
     to Sellers from such decisions, if any, including, but not limited to,
     reimbursement of Sellers' attorneys' fees for defending any claims by any
     Employees relating to such decisions and actions of Purchasers, PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that, upon acknowledging Purchasers' obligation therefor,
     Purchasers shall have the right to assume control of any defense of such
     claims, including without limitation the selection of legal counsel, and,


                                       16


<PAGE>

     PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Sellers shall not make any payments to or on behalf
     of any such Employees in connection with such claims, as settlement
     payments or otherwise, without the express written consent of Purchasers.

     1.07 THIRD-PARTY CONSENTS. To the extent that any Business Contract or
Personal Property Lease is not assignable without the consent of another party,
this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment
thereof if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or a default thereunder. Sellers and Purchasers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such other party to the assignment
of any such Business Contract or Personal Property Lease to Purchasers in all
cases in which such consent is required for such assignment. If any such consent
shall not be obtained, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchasers in any reasonable
arrangement designed to provide for Purchasers the benefits intended to be
assigned to Purchasers under the Business Contract or Personal Property Lease,
including enforcement at the cost and for the account of Purchasers of any and
all rights of Sellers against the other party thereto arising out of the breach
or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise. If and to the extent
that such arrangement cannot be made to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchasers, (a) such Purchasers shall have the right to exclude such Business
Contract or Personal Property Lease from the Assets pursuant to SECTION 1.01,
(b) Purchasers shall have no obligation pursuant to SECTION 1.02 or otherwise
with respect to any such Business Contract or Personal Property Lease, and (c)
such Business Contract or Personal Property Lease shall be excluded from the
Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

time to time after the Closing, at Purchasers' request and without further
consideration, Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchasers such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide
such materials and information and take such other actions as Purchasers may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order more effectively to transfer,
convey and assign to Purchasers the Business, and to confirm Purchasers' title
to the Assets.

     (b) Except with regard to matters set forth in ARTICLES IX and X, effective
on the Closing Date, Sellers hereby constitute and appoint Purchasers the true
and lawful attorney of Sellers, with full power of substitution, in the name of
Sellers or Purchasers, but on behalf of and for the benefit of Purchasers: (i)
to demand and receive from time to time any and all of the Assets and to make
endorsements and give receipts and releases for and in respect of the same and
any part thereof; (ii) to institute, prosecute, compromise and settle any and
all Actions or Proceedings that Purchasers may deem reasonably proper in order
to collect, assert or enforce any claim, right or title of any kind in or to the
Assets; (iii) to defend or compromise any or all Actions or Proceedings in
respect of any of the Assets; and (iv) to do all such acts and things in
relation to the matters set forth in the preceding clauses (i) through (iii) as

shall deliver to Purchasers at Closing an acknowledged power of attorney to the
foregoing effect executed by Sellers. Purchasers shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers from any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any actions
by Purchasers in their exercise of such power of attorney.

counsel and its accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable access to
the books, records and other data relating to the Business in its possession
with respect to periods prior to the Closing and the right to make copies and
extracts therefrom (provided such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business operations of each party), to the extent that such access may be
reasonably required by the requesting party in connection with (i) the
preparation of Tax Returns, (ii) the determination or enforcement of rights and
obligations under this Agreement, (iii) compliance with the requirements of any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, (iv) the determination or enforcement of

first offer in writing to surrender such books, records and other data to the
other party and such other party shall not agree in writing to take possession
thereof during the ten (10) Business Day period after such offer is made.

     (d) If, in order properly to prepare its Tax Returns, other documents or
reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or its
financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder, it is necessary
that a party be furnished with additional information, documents or records
relating to the Business not referred to in paragraph (c) above, and such
information, documents or records are in the possession or control of the other
party, such other party shall use its best efforts to furnish or make available
such information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the recipient's
request, cost and expense.

     (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this SECTION
1.08, if the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or
arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance

<PAGE>

          (ii) For purposes of this SECTION 8.01, other than with respect to
     income taxes, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes

     ends after the Closing Date, the determination of such Taxes for the
     portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or
     period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined based upon the
     relative number of days in the portion of the taxable period up to and
     including the Closing Date and the portion of the taxable period subsequent
     to the Closing Date. With respect to income taxes, Sellers' liability for
     Taxes shall be determined based on a closing of the books of the relevant
     entity, as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

     (b) (i) Sellers shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely
file (or cause to be timely filed) all Tax Returns relating to the Assets for

     period pursuant to SECTION 8.01(A)(II).

          (iii) Purchasers will cause the GmbH Subsidiary to prepare and timely
     file all Tax Returns of the GmbH Subsidiary for any taxable year or period
     ending on or before the Closing Date which are not required to be filed on
     or before the Closing Date. Purchasers shall provide Sellers with a copy of
     each Tax Return for Sellers' review and comment at least 30 days prior to
     the due date for filing such Tax Return. Sellers shall, at least 10
     Business Days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return, remit
     to Purchasers the amount shown as due on such Tax Return.

     (c) Sellers shall be liable for all Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall pay any

                                       45


<PAGE>

     revocation of any existing election with respect to Taxes which could
     affect the Assets or (B) settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax audit,
     dispute, or other Tax proceeding that could affect the Assets, in each case
     without Purchasers' express written consent thereto.

     (b) (i) Subject to the provisions of this SECTION 8.02, Sellers shall have
the right, at their own expense, to control, manage and be responsible for any
audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets for any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date
and shall have the right to settle or contest in their discretion any such
audit, contest, claim or proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) no settlement
or disposition of any such proceeding shall be made without Purchasers' written
consent if the same could reasonably be expected to affect Purchasers' potential
liability for Taxes in any taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending
after the Closing Date; (y) Purchasers shall control any proceeding relating to
a taxable period that begins before, and ends after, the Closing Date; and (z)
Purchasers shall have the right to attend and participate in (but not control)

     pursuant to SECTION 8.02(B)(I), Purchasers shall, at their own expense,
     control, manage and solely be responsible for any audit, contest, claim,

     or contest any such audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry without

Canada shall obtain a certificate pursuant to any applicable provincial retail
sales tax, health services tax or similar Laws confirming that all taxes
collectible or payable by Pioneer Canada under such Laws have been paid.

                            COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

     9.01 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.
Notwithstanding any right of Purchasers (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the Business or any right of any party (whether or not exercised) to

after the Closing Date, in the case of all other representations and warranties
and any covenant or agreement to be performed in whole or in part on or prior to
the Closing or (d) with respect to each other covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, until sixty (60) days following the last date on which such
covenant or agreement is to be performed or, if no such date is specified,
indefinitely; PROVIDED that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
that would otherwise terminate in accordance with clause (b), (c) or (d) above
will continue to survive if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable)
shall have been timely given under ARTICLE X on or prior to such termination
date, solely as to any claim or demand subject to such Claim Notice or Indemnity
Notice, until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or
otherwise resolved as provided in ARTICLE X.


                                    ARTICLE X

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     10.01 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this
Section and the other Sections of this ARTICLE X, Sellers shall indemnify the
Purchasers Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless
from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of
them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Sellers contained in
this Agreement, (ii) a Retained Liability, (iii) any liabilities, obligations or
commitments of Sellers or of the GmbH Subsidiary of any nature whatsoever
relating to the GmbH Subsidiary from Liabilities arising at any time on or prior

hereby owing to any party engaged by Sellers; (vi) any losses or expenses
arising out of the failure to obtain, prior to the Closing, an Estoppel

reasonably satisfactory to Purchasers, of the Real Property Leases relating to
the Fremont, California and the Hilden, Germany real properties or (vii) any
liability, obligation or commitment of Sellers arising out of or related to the
Action listed in SECTION 1.02(B)(IV) OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES to the extent
such liability, obligation or commitment relates to or arises out of a sale by
any Seller occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (provided that for purposes
of this clause (vii), "Losses" shall not include any court costs, fees of
attorneys, accountants and other experts or other expenses of or incurred in
connection with such Action).

     (b) Subject to the other Sections of this ARTICLE X, Purchasers shall
indemnify the Sellers Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them

any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out
of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty or nonfulfillment
of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of


                                       47


<PAGE>

Purchasers contained in this Agreement, (ii) an Assumed Liability, or (iii) any
brokerage or finders' fees arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby
owing or to any party engaged by Purchasers.

     (c) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable in the case of a claim by a
Purchasers Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01(A)(I) (A) unless and until the
Purchasers Indemnified Parties have suffered, incurred, sustained or become
subject to Losses referred to in such Section in excess of 1% of the Purchase
Price in the aggregate, in which event the Purchasers Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to claim the full amount of such Losses; and (B) after the
Purchasers Indemnified Parties have received payments from Sellers in respect of
claims made under such Section of an amount equal to 30% of the Purchase Price;
PROVIDED that this paragraph (c) shall not apply to (x) a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in SECTION 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.09 or 2.27,
or the breach of a covenant contained in SECTION 1.07, 4.09, 13.04 or 13.06, (y)
Sellers' obligations hereunder with respect to Retained Liabilities and
Purchasers' obligations hereunder with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, and
(z) any claims based on either party's fraud.

     (d) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable in the case of a claim by a
Purchasers Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01(A)(I) to the extent (i) the
subject matter of the claim is covered by and paid pursuant to a warranty or
indemnification from a third party or (ii) a Loss directly results from the
termination of any Business Contract with any Named Supplier (other than Power
and Signal) by such Named Supplier other than for cause or the termination of
any Business Contract with any customer by such customer other than for cause.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for in this Agreement, to the
extent that the Closing Purchase Price has been adjusted pursuant to SECTION
1.04(C) and Purchasers are paid for any claim in connection therewith,
Purchasers shall not be entitled to a "second" payment under SECTION
10.01(A)(I), as a result of any breach of representation or warranty or
nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Sellers contained in this Agreement, for the same claim, based on the identical
facts and circumstances.

     10.02 METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01 will be asserted and resolved as follows:

     (a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified
Party might seek indemnity under SECTION 10.01 is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Sellers or any
Affiliates of Sellers or of Purchasers (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice
with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such
failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under SECTION
10.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense,
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.


                                       48


<PAGE>

          (i) If the indemnifying Party nofifies the Indemnified Party within
     the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
     Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
     SECTION 10.02(A), then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
     defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at
     the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim
     by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and
     diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or
     will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with
     the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
     unreasonably withheld in the case of any settlement as to which the
     Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full). The Indemnifying Party will
     be deemed to have waived its right to dispute its liability to the
     Indemnified Party under SECTION 10.01 with respect to any Third Party Claim
     as to which it elects to control the defense. The Indemnifying Party will
     have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
     or settlement thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party may,
     at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to
     the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first
     sentence of this Section 10.02(a)(i), file any motion, answer or other
     pleadings or take any other action that is reasonably necessary or
     appropriate to protect the Indemnified Party's interests; and PROVIDED
     FURTHER, that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
     will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide
     reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting any Third
     Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified
     Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not control, any
     defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
     Indemnifying Party pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A)(I), and the
     Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
     separate counsel except as provided in the preceding sentence and except
     that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of such
     separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it
     is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be
     represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict
     exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the
     named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party
     and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good
     faith, based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that
     are unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
     the Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
     settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
     Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives
     its right to indemnity under SECTION 10.01 with respect to such Third Party
     Claim.

          (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party
     within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
     Third Party Claim pursuant to SECTION 10.02(A), or if the Indemnifying
     Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the
     Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to
     defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third
     Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be
     prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the
     discretion of the Indemnified


                                       49


<PAGE>


     Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not
     be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full control of
     such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement
     thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the
     Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
     Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its
     counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is
     contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION
     10.02(A)(II), if the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party
     within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
     liability hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
     Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying
     Party in the manner provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party
     will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified
     Party's defense pursuant to this SECTION 10.02(A)(II) or of the
     Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified Party's
     request, and the Indemnified Party will bear all costs and expenses and
     reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and
     expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such
     litigation. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
     defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
     SECTION 10.02(A)(II), and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs
     and expenses with respect to such participation.

          (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it
     does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the
     Third Party Claim under SECTION 10.01 or fails to notify the Indemnified
     Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
     liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
     the Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a
     liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 10.01 and the
     Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified
     Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the
     Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
     claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in
     good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved
     through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be
     resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under SECTION
10.01 against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to SECTION 9.01, the failure by
any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's
rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates
that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in
such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in
such Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such
Indemnity Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party under SECTION 10.01 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of
such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination
thereof. If the


                                       50


<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations
within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a
court of competent jurisdiction.
