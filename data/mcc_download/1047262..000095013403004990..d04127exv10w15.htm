The Employee may transfer Restricted Shares (A)&nbsp;by beneficiary designation,

the repurchase is to be effected. Such date shall not be more than 30&nbsp;days
after the date of the notice. The certificate(s) representing the Restricted
Shares to be repurchased shall, prior to the close of business on the date
specified for the repurchase, be delivered to Company properly endorsed for

(including money paid other than as an ordinary cash dividend) that by reason
of such transaction are distributed with respect to any Restricted Shares or
into which such Restricted Shares thereby become convertible shall immediately
be subject to the Right of Repurchase. Appropriate adjustments to reflect the
distribution of such securities or property shall be made to the number and/or
class of the Restricted Shares. After each such transaction, appropriate
adjustments shall also be made to the price per share to be paid upon the
exercise of the Right of Repurchase in order to reflect any change in Company&#146;s
outstanding securities effected without receipt of consideration therefor;
provided, however, that the aggregate purchase price payable for the Restricted
Shares shall remain the same.

would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such restrictions.
The Employee also acknowledges that any breach by him of Sections&nbsp;5, 6 or 7
hereof will cause continuing and irreparable injury to the Company for which

respect to such venue. Any judgment entered against either of the parties in
any proceeding hereunder may be entered and enforced by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to
any other relief, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and disbursements.
