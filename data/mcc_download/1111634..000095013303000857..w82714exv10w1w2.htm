</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this XO Communications, Inc. Employee Retention and
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to encourage eligible employees of XO
Communications, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) to continue their employment with the
Company during the period of the Company&#146;s restructuring and to incentivise
these employees to achieve certain corporate performance goals by establishing
retention bonuses that may be paid to these employees upon completion of
certain service requirements and the accomplishment of certain corporate
performance objectives including the successful reorganization of the Company
and achieving certain earnings objectives. Up to $25&nbsp;million in the aggregate
shall be available for the payment of retention bonuses under the Plan (each
such bonus is hereafter referred to as a &#147;Retention Bonus&#148;). Exhibit&nbsp;A,
attached hereto, sets forth the projected grade levels of employee
participants, percentage of base salary used to determine each Participant&#146;s
Maximum Bonus (as such terms are defined below) (except for those Participants
employed after April&nbsp;1, 2002), number of employees in each grade level and
aggregate bonus amount for each grade level.

such Plan is filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
