          or  a  domestic  relations order only, to any of such Grantee's family

          Options  expressly  so  permits  or  is amended to so permit, (ii) the
          Grantee  does  not  receive  any  consideration for such transfer, and
          (iii)  the  Grantee  provides  such   documentation   or   information
          concerning  any  such  transfer  or  transferee  as  the Committee may
          reasonably  request.  For  purposes  of  this  Section 11, a Grantee's

          any  person  sharing  the  Grantee's household (other than a tenant or
          employee), a trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent
          of  the  beneficial  interest, a foundation in which these persons (or
          the Grantee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in
          which  these  persons  (or the Grantee) own more than fifty percent of
          the  voting  interests."
