with the solicitation of proxies by the management of LUKE ENERGY LTD. </B>(the
&#147;Corporation&#148;) for use at the Special Meeting of the Shareholders of the
Corporation (the &#147;Meeting&#148;) to be held on the 14th day of April, 2003 at 10:00
a.m. (Calgary time) in the Cardium Room of the Calgary Petroleum Club, 319 &#150;
5th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, T2P 0L5 and at any adjournment thereof, for
the purposes set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting. Instruments of Proxy
must be received by the President of the Corporation c/o Computershare Trust
Company of Canada, 9th Floor, 100 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2Y1
not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before the
time for the holding of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation has fixed the record date for the Meeting at the
close of business on March&nbsp;15, 2003 (the &#147;Record Date&#148;). Only Shareholders of
the Corporation of record as at that date are entitled to receive notice of the
Meeting. Shareholders of record will be entitled to vote those shares included
in the list of Shareholders entitled to vote at the Meeting prepared as at the
Record Date, unless any such shareholder transfers shares after the Record Date
and the transferee of those shares establishes ownership of such shares and
demands, not later than ten days prior to the Meeting that the transferee&#146;s
name be included in the list of Shareholders entitled to vote at the Meeting,
in which case such transferee shall be entitled to vote such shares at the
Meeting.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing and shall be
executed by the shareholder or the shareholder&#146;s attorney authorized in writing
or, if the shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an
officer or attorney thereof duly authorized.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The persons named in the enclosed instrument of proxy are directors and/or
officers of the Corporation. Each shareholder has the right to appoint a
proxyholder other than the persons designated above, who need not be a
shareholder, to attend and to act for the shareholder at the Meeting. To
exercise such right, the names of the nominees of management should be crossed
out and the name of the shareholder&#146;s appointee should be legibly printed in
the blank space provided.</B>
</FONT>
<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>REVOCABILITY OF PROXY</B>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shareholder who has submitted a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to
the exercise thereof. If a shareholder who has given a proxy attends
personally at the Meeting at which such proxy is to be voted, such person may
revoke the proxy and vote in person. In addition to revocation in any other
manner permitted by law, a proxy may be revoked by instrument in writing
executed by the shareholder or the shareholder&#146;s attorney authorized in writing
or, if the shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an
officer or attorney thereof duly authorized and deposited either at the
registered office of the Corporation at any time up to and including the last
business day preceding the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, at
which the proxy is to be used, or with the Chairman of the Meeting on the day
of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, and upon either of such deposits,
the proxy is revoked.

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to
many Shareholders (&#147;Shareholders&#148;) who do not hold their common shares (&#147;Common
Shares&#148;) in their own name. </B>Only proxies deposited by Shareholders whose names
appear on the records of the Corporation as the registered holders of Common
Shares can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting. If Common Shares are
listed in your account statement provided by your broker, then in almost all
cases those Common Shares will not be registered in your name on the records of
the Corporation. Such Common Shares will likely be registered under the name
of your broker or an agent of that broker. In Canada, the vast majority of
such shares are registered under the name of

<P><FONT size="2">CDS &#038; Co., the registration name for The Canadian Depository for
Securities Limited, which acts as nominees for many Canadian brokerage firms.
Common Shares held by your broker or their nominee can only be voted upon your
instructions. Without specific instructions, your broker or their nominee is
prohibited from voting your shares.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicable regulatory policy requires your broker to seek voting
instructions from you in advance of the Meeting. Every broker has its own
mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions, which you should
carefully follow in order to ensure that your Common Shares are voted at the
Meeting. Often, the form of proxy supplied by your broker is identical to the
instrument of proxy provided by the Corporation to registered Shareholders.
However, its purpose is limited to instructing the registered shareholder how
to vote on your behalf. The majority of brokers now delegate responsibility
for obtaining instructions from clients to the ADP Investor Communications.
The Independent Investor Communications Corporation mails a scannable Voting
Instruction Form in lieu of the Instrument of Proxy. You are asked to complete
and return the Voting Instruction Form to them by mail or facsimile.
Alternately, you can call their toll-free telephone number to vote your Common
Shares. They then tabulate the results of all instructions received and
provide appropriate instructions respecting the voting of the Common Shares to
be represented at the Meeting. <B>If you receive a Voting Instruction Form from
Independent Investor Communications Corporation it cannot be used as a proxy to
vote Common Shares directly at the Meeting as the proxy must be returned to
Independent Investor Communications Corporation well in advance of the Meeting
in order to have the Common Shares voted.</B>

The costs incurred in the preparation and mailing of the Instrument of Proxy,
Notice of Special Meeting and this Information Circular &#151; Proxy Statement will
be borne by the Corporation. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may
be solicited by personal interviews, telephone or other means of communication
and by directors, officers and employees of the Corporation, who will not be
specifically remunerated therefor.

<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>EXERCISE OF DISCRETION BY PROXY</B>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Common Shares represented by proxy in favour of management nominees
shall be voted on any ballot at the Meeting and, where the shareholder
specifies a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the Common
Shares shall be voted on any ballot in accordance with the specification so
made.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>In the absence of such specification, the Common Shares will be voted in
favour of the matters to be acted upon. The persons appointed under the
instrument of proxy furnished by the Corporation are conferred with
discretionary authority with respect to amendments or variations of those
matters specified in the instrument of proxy provided by the Corporation and
the Notice of Special Meeting. At the time of printing this Information
Circular &#151; Proxy Statement, management of the Corporation knows of no such
amendment, variation or other matter.</B>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed
advisable, approve an Ordinary Resolution ratifying and approving the issuance
of an aggregate of up to 24,827,585 Special Warrants at a subscription price of
$1.45 per Special Warrant (the &#147;Private Placement&#148;), each Special Warrant being
exercisable for one (1)&nbsp;Common Share of the Corporation without additional
consideration, for gross proceeds to the Corporation of approximately $36
million (the &#147;Offering&#148;). The net proceeds from the Offering will be utilized
to fund working capital and Luke&#146;s drilling and acquisition program.
<B>Directors, officers, employees and other insiders of Luke have agreed to
subscribe for an aggregate of 2,068,966 Special Warrants for an aggregate of
approximately $3&nbsp;million and, in accordance with the requirements of the

in relation to the Ordinary Resolution approving the Private Placement</B>.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;5, 2003, Luke announced that it had entered into a financing
agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Griffiths McBurney &#038; Partners
and including First Associates Investments Inc., Yorkton Securities Inc. and
Tristone Capital Inc. (collectively the &#147;Underwriters&#148;) to issue up to
14,482,758 Special Warrants at $1.45 each and up to an aggregate 24,827,585
Special Warrants if the over-allotment option granted by the Corporation to the
Underwriters at a subscription price of $1.45 per Special Warrant is exercised,
resulting in total gross proceeds of the Offering, if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full, of approximately Cdn. $36&nbsp;million. As at the date
hereof, the Corporation anticipates that the over-allotment will be exercised
in full and accordingly, the gross proceeds to be received by the Corporation
at closing, scheduled for March&nbsp;25, 2003, is expected to be Cdn. $36&nbsp;million.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the size of the Offering, the Toronto Stock Exchange requires that
Shareholders of the Corporation ratify and approve the issuance of the Special
Warrants and the Common Shares issuable on exercise thereof.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Warrants shall be duly and validly created and issued pursuant
to the terms of a special warrant indenture (the &#147;Special Warrant Indenture&#148;)
to be entered into between the Corporation and Computershare Trust Company of
Canada, as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Warrant Indenture will provide that: (i)&nbsp;upon closing of the
sale of the Special Warrants, all proceeds from the sale of the Special
Warrants (the &#147;Escrowed Funds&#148;) will be deposited with the Trustee. The
Escrowed Funds will only be released to the Corporation upon receipt, on or
prior to May&nbsp;15, 2003, by the Trustee of a notice from the Corporation
acknowledged by the Underwriters to the effect that the Shareholders of Luke
have ratified the issuance of the Special Warrants and approved the issuance of
the Common Shares issuable on exercise thereof in accordance with the
requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the &#147;Shareholder Approval Notice&#148;);
and (ii)&nbsp;if the Shareholder Approval Notice shall not have been provided to the
Trustee on or before 5:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on May&nbsp;15, 2003 (the &#147;Repurchase
Event&#148;) or such later date as is mutually agreed to by the Corporation and
Griffiths McBurney &#038; Partners, then on the date of the Repurchase Event, the
Corporation will be deemed to have repurchased, and each holder of Special
Warrants will be deemed to have sold to the Corporation, all of the Special
Warrants held by it at a price equal to $1.45 per Special Warrant, upon which
the Trustee shall make payment to subscribers of Special Warrants in the amount
of $1.45 per Special Warrant plus a pro rata portion of the interest earned by
the Trustee on the Escrowed Funds.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The directors of Luke believe that the above resolution is in the best
interests of Luke and recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of the
resolution. As a start-up company Luke cannot initially afford to pay salaries
that are industry competitive. In the near-term, Luke plans to recruit both
geological and engineering personnel and must rely heavily on stock options as
the most significant incentive it can offer to attract quality professionals.
Under the Corporation&#146;s Stock Option Plan, when options are granted they are
priced at the market trading price for Luke&#146;s Common Shares. Options will
therefore ultimately be &#147;in the money&#148; only if Luke&#146;s share price increases,
and employees holding options thus have a vested interest in ensuring the
Corporation&#146;s success. In order for the foregoing resolution to be passed, it
must be approved by a simple majority of the votes cast by Shareholders who
vote in person or by proxy at the Meeting. The persons named in the enclosed
form of proxy, if named as proxy, intend to vote for the approval of the
Ordinary Resolution amending the Stock Option Plan. If this amendment is
approved, the maximum number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to the Stock
Option Plan will be 3,305,395 Common Shares or approximately 10% of the issued
and outstanding Common Shares after giving effect to the Private Placement.
