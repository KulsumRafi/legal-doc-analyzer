                                 PROMISSORY NOTE


$40,000,000                       Dallas, Texas                 October 15, 2002


         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PREFERRED HOME MORTGAGE COMPANY, a
Florida corporation ("Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of GUARANTY BANK
(herein called "Lender"), the principal sum of Forty Million Dollars
($40,000,000) or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans
made under this Note by Lender to Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement (as hereinafter defined), together with interest on the unpaid
principal balance thereof as hereinafter set forth, both principal and interest
payable as herein provided in lawful money of the United States of America at
the offices of the Lender, 8333 Douglas Avenue, Dallas, Texas or at such other
place within Dallas County, Texas, as from time to time may be designated by the
holder of this Note.

         This Note (a) is issued and delivered under that certain Credit
Agreement dated as of August 1, 2002 among Borrower, Technical Mortgage, L.P.
and Lender (herein, as from time to time supplemented, amended or restated,
called the "Credit Agreement"), and is a Note as defined therein, (b) is subject
to the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, which contains provisions
for payments and prepayments hereunder and acceleration of the maturity hereof
upon the happening of certain stated events, and (c) is secured by and entitled
to the benefits of certain Security Instruments (as identified and defined in
the Credit Agreement). Payments on this Note shall be made and applied as
provided herein and in the Credit Agreement. Reference is hereby made to the
Credit Agreement for a description of certain rights, limitations of rights,
obligations and duties of the parties hereto and for the meanings assigned to
terms used and not defined herein and to the Security Instruments for a
description of the nature and extent of the security thereby provided and the
rights of the parties thereto. This Note is executed in renewal, modification
and extension of, but not in extinguishment or novation of, the indebtedness of
Borrower owing to Lender pursuant to that certain Promissory Note dated August
1, 2002, in the stated principal amount of $30,000,000 executed by Borrower and
payable to the order of Lender.

         The principal amount of this Note, together with all interest accrued
hereon, shall be due and payable in full on the Drawdown Termination Date.

         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Base
Rate Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) from time to time
outstanding shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the Base Rate in
effect on such day. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all
Base Rate Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) from time to
time


                                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT


<PAGE>



outstanding shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the applicable
Default Rate in effect on such day. On the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar
month, beginning on the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month immediately
following the calendar month in which this Note is executed, Borrower shall pay
to the holder hereof all unpaid interest which has accrued on all Base Rate
Loans through and including the last day of the immediately preceding calendar
month.

         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each
Eurodollar Loan (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) shall bear
interest on each day during the related Interest Period at the related Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate in effect on such day. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, all Eurodollar Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or
interest) from time to time outstanding shall bear interest on each day
outstanding at the applicable Default Rate in effect on such day. On the last
day of the related Interest Period, Borrower shall pay to the holder hereof all
unpaid interest which has accrued on such Eurodollar Loan to but not including
such day; provided that if an Event of Default exists under Section 7.1(a) of
the Credit Agreement, on the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month
Borrower shall pay to the holder hereof all unpaid interest which has accrued on
such Eurodollar Loan through and including the last day of the immediately
preceding calendar month. All past due principal of and past due interest on the
Loans shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the applicable Default Rate
in effect on such day, and such interest shall be due and payable daily as it
accrues. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph: A. this
Note shall never bear interest in excess of the Maximum Rate, and B. if at any
time the rate at which interest is payable on this Note is limited by the
Maximum Rate (by the foregoing subsection (a) or by reference to the Maximum
Rate in the definitions of Base Rate, Eurodollar Rate, and Default Rate), this
Note shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate and shall continue to bear interest
at the Maximum Rate until such time as the total amount of interest accrued
hereon equals (but does not exceed) the total amount of interest which would
have accrued hereon had there been no Maximum Rate applicable hereto.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph and all other provisions of
this Note, in no event shall the interest payable hereon, whether before or
after maturity, exceed the maximum amount of interest which, under applicable
law, may be charged on this Note, and this Note is expressly made subject to the
provisions of the Credit Agreement which more fully set out the limitations on
how interest accrues hereon. In the event applicable law provides for a ceiling
under Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly
rate ceiling and shall be used in this Note for calculating the Maximum Rate and
for all other purposes. The term "applicable law" as used in this Note shall
mean the laws of the State of Texas or the laws of the United States, whichever
laws allow the greater interest, as such laws now exist or may be changed or
amended or come into effect in the future.

         If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection after
default, or if all or any part of the indebtedness represented hereby is proved,
established or collected in any court or in any bankruptcy, receivership, debtor
relief, probate or other court proceedings, Borrower and all endorsers, sureties
and guarantors of this Note jointly and severally agree to pay reasonable
attorneys' fees and collection costs to the holder hereof in addition to the
principal and interest payable hereunder.

changes in any manner of or in this Note or in any of its terms, provisions and
covenants, or any releases or substitutions of any security, or any delay,
indulgence or other act of any trustee or any holder hereof, whether before or
after maturity.

         No waiver by Lender of any of its rights or remedies hereunder or under
any other document evidencing or securing this Note or otherwise shall be
considered a waiver of any other subsequent right or remedy of Lender; no delay
or omission in the exercise or enforcement by Lender of any rights or remedies
shall ever by construed as a waiver of any right or remedy of Lender; and no
exercise or enforcement of any such rights or remedies shall ever be held to
exhaust any right or remedy of Lender.

         Borrower reserves the right to prepay the outstanding principal balance
of this Note, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without
premium or penalty, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

                                 PROMISSORY NOTE


$40,000,000                        Dallas, Texas                October 15, 2002


FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, TECHNICAL MORTGAGE, L.P., a Texas limited
partnership ("Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of GUARANTY BANK (herein
called "Lender"), the principal sum of Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) or,
if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans made under this Note
by Lender to Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance
thereof as hereinafter set forth, both principal and interest payable as herein
provided in lawful money of the United States of America at the offices of the
Lender, 8333 Douglas Avenue, Dallas, Texas or at such other place within Dallas
County, Texas, as from time to time may be designated by the holder of this
Note.

         This Note (a) is issued and delivered under that certain Credit
Agreement dated as of August 1, 2002 among Borrower, Preferred Home Mortgage
Company and Lender (herein, as from time to time supplemented, amended or
restated, called the "Credit Agreement"), and is a Note as defined therein, (b)
is subject to the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, which contains
provisions for payments and prepayments hereunder and acceleration of the
maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events, and (c) is secured
by and entitled to the benefits of certain Security Instruments (as identified
and defined in the Credit Agreement). Payments on this Note shall be made and
applied as provided herein and in the Credit Agreement. Reference is hereby made
to the Credit Agreement for a description of certain rights, limitations of
rights, obligations and duties of the parties hereto and for the meanings
assigned to terms used and not defined herein and to the Security Instruments
for a description of the nature and extent of the security thereby provided and
the rights of the parties thereto. This Note is executed in renewal,
modification and extension of, but not in extinguishment or novation of, the
indebtedness of Borrower owing to Lender pursuant to that certain Promissory
Note dated August 1, 2002, in the stated principal amount of $30,000,000
executed by Borrower and payable to the order of Lender.

         The principal amount of this Note, together with all interest accrued
hereon, shall be due and payable in full on the Drawdown Termination Date.

         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Base
Rate Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) from time to time
outstanding shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the Base Rate in
effect on such day. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all
Base Rate Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) from time to
time


                                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

outstanding shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the applicable
Default Rate in effect on such day. On the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar
month, beginning on the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month immediately
following the calendar month in which this Note is executed, Borrower shall pay
to the holder hereof all unpaid interest which has accrued on all Base Rate
Loans through and including the last day of the immediately preceding calendar
month.

         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each
Eurodollar Loan (exclusive of any past due principal or interest) shall bear
interest on each day during the related Interest Period at the related Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate in effect on such day. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, all Eurodollar Loans (exclusive of any past due principal or
interest) from time to time outstanding shall bear interest on each day
outstanding at the applicable Default Rate in effect on such day. On the last
day of the related Interest Period, Borrower shall pay to the holder hereof all
unpaid interest which has accrued on such Eurodollar Loan to but not including
such day; provided that if an Event of Default exists under Section 7.1(a) of
the Credit Agreement, on the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month
Borrower shall pay to the holder hereof all unpaid interest which has accrued on
such Eurodollar Loan through and including the last day of the immediately
preceding calendar month. All past due principal of and past due interest on the
Loans shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the applicable Default Rate
in effect on such day, and such interest shall be due and payable daily as it
accrues. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph: a. this
Note shall never bear interest in excess of the Maximum Rate, and b. if at any
time the rate at which interest is payable on this Note is limited by the
Maximum Rate (by the foregoing subsection (a) or by reference to the Maximum
Rate in the definitions of Base Rate, Eurodollar Rate, and Default Rate), this
Note shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate and shall continue to bear interest
at the Maximum Rate until such time as the total amount of interest accrued
hereon equals (but does not exceed) the total amount of interest which would
have accrued hereon had there been no Maximum Rate applicable hereto.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph and all other provisions of
this Note, in no event shall the interest payable hereon, whether before or
after maturity, exceed the maximum amount of interest which, under applicable
law, may be charged on this Note, and this Note is expressly made subject to the
provisions of the Credit Agreement which more fully set out the limitations on
how interest accrues hereon. In the event applicable law provides for a ceiling
under Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly
rate ceiling and shall be used in this Note for calculating the Maximum Rate and
for all other purposes. The term "applicable law" as used in this Note shall
mean the laws of the State of Texas or the laws of the United States, whichever
laws allow the greater interest, as such laws now exist or may be changed or
amended or come into effect in the future.

         If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection after
default, or if all or any part of the indebtedness represented hereby is proved,
established or collected in any court or in any bankruptcy, receivership, debtor
relief, probate or other court proceedings, Borrower and all endorsers, sureties
and guarantors of this Note jointly and severally agree to pay reasonable
attorneys' fees and collection costs to the holder hereof in addition to the
principal and interest payable hereunder.

changes in any manner of or in this Note or in any of its terms, provisions and
covenants, or any releases or substitutions of any security, or any delay,
indulgence or other act of any trustee or any holder hereof, whether before or
after maturity.

         No waiver by Lender of any of its rights or remedies hereunder or under
any other document evidencing or securing this Note or otherwise shall be
considered a waiver of any other subsequent right or remedy of Lender; no delay
or omission in the exercise or enforcement by Lender of any rights or remedies
shall ever by construed as a waiver of any right or remedy of Lender; and no
exercise or enforcement of any such rights or remedies shall ever be held to
exhaust any right or remedy of Lender.

         Borrower reserves the right to prepay the outstanding principal balance
of this Note, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without
premium or penalty, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
