Retirement a Participant has recognized gross income for Federal Income tax
purposes in excess of the Standard or Alternative Retirement Benefit actually
paid by the Employer to which such gross income is attributable, the Employer
shall deem the Participant to have elected a lump sum payment of his Alternative
Retirement Benefit effective as of his Normal Retirement. Under these
circumstances, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in one lump sum, within
sixty (60) days of such final determination, an amount equal to the excess of
(a) the lump sum Alternative Retirement Benefit that would have been payable to
the Participant had the Participant so elected such an Alternative Retirement
Benefit in his Agreement plus interest thereon of 10% per annum, compounded
annually, from a Participant&#146;s Normal Retirement until receipt of such lump
sum payment, less (b) any amounts of Standard or Alternative Retirement Benefit
theretofore paid to such Participant plus interest thereon at 10% per annum,
compounded annually from the date of receipt of each such amount to the date a
Participant received such lump sum payment. If a benefit is payable to a
Participant pursuant to this paragraph, no other Standard or Alternative

For
purposes of computing the Vested Benefits (as such term is used in rabbi trusts

the payment of benefits under the Plan) corresponding to an EPR Alternative
Termination Benefit, for all Trust purposes, including for purposes of

date of Participant&#146;s death if Participant dies after attaining age
fifty-five or until reaching the Participant&#146;s Early Retirement date for
such Unit as selected by the Participant if Participant survives until such

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         In consideration for treatment under the EPR provisions of the Plan, Participant agrees as follows:</font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Participant agrees that Participant shall not, without the written consent of Participant&#146;s SBC Communications Inc.
(&#147;SBC&#148;) employing company (&#147;Company&#148;), and while employed by the Company or within three (3) years after termination of employment
from Company, engage in competition with SBC or any Subsidiary thereof or with any business with which a Subsidiary of SBC or an
affiliated company has a substantial interest (collectively referred to herein as &#147;Employer business&#148;).  For purposes of this
Agreement, engaging in competition with any Employer business shall mean engaging by Participant in any business or activity in the
same geographical market where the same or substantially similar business or activity is being carried on as an Employer business.
Such term shall not include owning a nonsubstantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business that competes with an
Employer business.  However, it is hereby specifically agreed that engaging in competition with an Employer business shall include
representing or providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any person or entity that is engaged in competition with
any Employer business or that takes a position adverse to any Employer business in a judicial, regulatory, legislative or
administrative proceeding and Participant hereby specifically agrees not to engage in any such conduct.  Participant also
specifically agrees that a breach of this provision would result if, within the time period and without the written consent
specified, Participant either engages directly in competitive activity or in any capacity in any location becomes employed by,
associated with, or renders service to any company, or parent or affiliate thereof, or any Subsidiary of any of them, if any of them
is engaged in competition with an Employer business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes and regardless of
whether or not the employing company, or the company that Participant becomes associated with or renders service to, is itself
engaged in direct competition with an Employer business.</font></p>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participant may submit a
description of proposed employment in writing to Company and Company shall
advise Participant in writing within ten business days whether such proposed
employment would constitute engaging in competition with an Employer business. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant acknowledges that, as a result of Participant's employment by the Company, Participant had and continued
to have until Participant's termination, access to trade secrets, intellectual property, proprietary information, and private
non-public information including technological, legal, financial, marketing, personnel and other information (including this
Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein) relating to litigation, the business and contemplated business of the Company
and SBC and other matters, all of which is confidential and proprietary to SBC and the Company (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;); and
Participant agrees that Participant did not before and will not after Participant's termination, divulge or in any way make available
to others through public statements, voluntary testimony, or otherwise, or make use of, alone or in concert with others, any
Confidential Information.  The aforesaid obligations regarding Confidential Information will not apply to information that is now in
or hereafter enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein, nor shall they
apply to information required to be delivered pursuant to a subpoena or similar legislative, judicial or administrative requirement;
provided, however, Participant will notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or similar request, and give the Company a
reasonable opportunity to contest or otherwise oppose the subpoena or similar request.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participant may represent
himself or herself as a retiree of Company (if Participant is actually Service
Pension eligible) or as a former employee who voluntarily terminated employment
for a reason other than cause (if Participant is not actually Service Pension
eligible); but otherwise Participant agrees that Participant will not make, nor
cause to be made any public statements, disclosures or publications which relate
in any way, directly or indirectly to Participant&#146;s cessation of employment
with the Company without prior written approval by the Company. Participant also
agrees that Participant will not make, nor cause to be made any public
statements, disclosures or publications which portray unfavorably, reflect
adversely on, or are derogatory or inimical to the best interests of, the
Company, SBC, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents,
past, present or future. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant agrees that during the three (3) year period immediately after termination of Participant&#146;s employment
with Company, Participant will not solicit any customer of any SBC company on behalf of Participant or any other person or entity or
solicit any employee of any SBC company to seek or accept employment with any other person or entity, or disclose confidential
information about such employee to any prospective employer or employer other than an SBC company.  Participant acknowledges that
even an unsuccessful solicitation of an employee of any SBC company will negatively impact the morale, commitment and performance of
the employee in question.  Participant further acknowledges that any solicitation of either a customer or an employee of any SBC
company will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the SBC company, for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and that
the SBC company will be entitled to equitable relief to restrain Participant from violating the terms of this Paragraph 3, in
addition to any other remedies available to the SBC Company.  In any action brought by any SBC company to enforce the provisions of
this Paragraph 3, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable and actual
attorneys&#146; fees.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Participant shall forfeit Participant&#146;s Alternative Termination Benefit(s) under the EPR provisions of the Plan, for
any breach by Participant of the provisions of Paragraph 1 hereof, or of Paragraph 2 hereof (except to the extent disclosure of any
Confidential Information is specifically required by law), or of Paragraph 3 hereof, or of the Release of Claims contained herein. In
the event of any such forfeiture of any Alternative Termination Benefit(s), Participant shall receive the Termination Benefit
corresponding to such Unit of Participation pursuant to the Plan, that would have been paid in the absence of this Agreement, less
any amounts previously paid to Participant as part of the corresponding Alternative Termination Benefit.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Company hereby expressly advises Participant to seek personal legal advice prior to executing this Agreement and the
Release of Claims contained herein and Participant by Participant&#146;s signature below, hereby expressly acknowledges that Participant
was given at least forty-five (45) days in which to seek such advice and decide whether or not to enter into this Agreement and the
Release of Claims contained herein.  The parties agree that any changes to this Agreement or to the Release of Claims contained
herein made after the initial draft of this Agreement and Release of Claims is presented to Participant, whether material or
immaterial, do not restart the running of said forty-five (45) day period.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Participant may revoke this Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein within seven (7) days of
Participant&#146;s execution of this Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein by giving notice, in writing, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the Company c/o the Executive Compensation Group, 175 East Houston Street, Room 3-J-4, San Antonio,

Paragraph. In the event of any such revocation, this entire Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein shall be null and
void.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Participant agrees that for any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and the
Release of Claims contained herein by Participant, the Company shall have no adequate legal remedy, and in addition to any other
remedies available, a restraining order and/or an injunction may be issued against Participant to prevent or restrain any such
breach, in addition to any other rights the Company may have.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event any provision of this Agreement or the Release of Claims contained herein is held invalid, void, or
unenforceable, the same shall not affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of any other provision of this Agreement or said
Release of Claims, except that should said Release of Claims be held to be invalid as applicable to and as asserted by Participant
with regard to any claim or dispute covered thereunder, or should any part of the provisions of Paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of this
Agreement be held invalid, void or unenforceable as applicable to and as asserted by Participant, this Agreement and the Release of
Claims contained herein, at the Company&#146;s option, may be declared by the Company null and void. If this Agreement and the Release of
Claims contained herein are declared null and void by Company pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph, Participant shall return
to Company all consideration previously received pursuant to this Agreement and the Release of Claims contained herein less any of
said consideration Participant would have received in the absence of entering into this Agreement and the Release of Claims contained
herein.</FONT></P>
