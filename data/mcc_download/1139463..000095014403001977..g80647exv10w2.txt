         SECTION 2.        Terms of the Guaranty.

                  (a)      Guaranty of Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby,
         jointly and severally with the other Guarantors, unconditionally
         guarantees to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
         itself and the Lenders, and their respective permitted successors,
         endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt payment (whether at
         stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of all
         Obligations of the Borrower, whether primary or secondary (whether by
         way of endorsement or otherwise), whether now existing or hereafter
         arising, whether or not from time to time reduced or extinguished
         (except by payment thereof) or hereafter increased or incurred, whether
         or not recovery may be or hereafter become barred by the statute of
         limitations, whether enforceable or unenforceable as against the
         Borrower, whether or not discharged, stayed or

                                       12

<PAGE>

         otherwise affected by any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
         or proceeding, whether created directly with the Administrative Agent
         or any Lender or acquired by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
         through assignment, endorsement or otherwise, whether matured or
         unmatured, whether joint or several, as and when the same become due
         and payable (whether at maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration,
         mandatory repayment or otherwise), in accordance with the terms of any
         such instruments evidencing any such Obligations, including all
         renewals, extensions or modifications thereof.

                  (b)      Additional Guaranty of Performance. Additionally,
         each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors,
         unconditionally guarantees to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
         benefit of itself and the Lenders, and their respective permitted
         successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the timely performance
         of all other obligations of Borrower under the Loan Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents, including, without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, that:

                           (i)      the Improvements will be constructed upon
                  the Land in accordance with this Agreement and the Plans; and

                           (ii)     the Improvements will be completed and ready
                  for occupancy, including delivery of any certificates required
                  by Applicable Law, the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
                  Documents, on or before the date required in the Loan
                  Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         In the event the foregoing conditions are not complied with in any
         respect whatsoever, the Guarantors hereby agree to (i) assume all
         responsibility for the completion of the Improvements and, at the
         Guarantors' own cost and expense, to cause the Improvements to be fully
         completed in accordance with the Plans and in accordance with the Loan
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (ii) pay all bills in
         connection with the construction of the Improvements; and (iii)
         indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless
         from any and all loss, cost, liability or expense that the
         Administrative Agent or the Lenders may suffer by reason of any such
         event (except with respect to the willful misconduct or the gross
         negligence of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders). The
         Administrative Agent shall accept performance by the Guarantors of the
         Borrower's obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents, and so long as all of said obligations are being performed
         by the Borrower or the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent will make
         the proceeds of the Construction Loan Advances available under the
         terms of the Loan Agreement. If, after the occurrence of a Default or
         Event of Default, the Required Lenders are not satisfied with the
         progress of construction by the Borrower and/or the Guarantors, the
         Administrative Agent shall, if required by the Required Lenders, and on
         behalf of Lenders, after first having given notice to the Guarantors at
         the address and in the manner set forth in Section 12.1 of the Loan
         Agreement, complete the Improvements either before or after
         commencement of foreclosure proceedings or before or after any other
         remedy

                                       13

<PAGE>

         of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders against the Borrower or the
         Guarantors, with such changes or modifications in the Plans which the
         Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary and expend such sums as
         the Administrative Agent, in its discretion, reasonably deems necessary
         and proper in order to so complete the Improvements, and the Guarantors
         hereby waive any right to contest any such reasonably necessary
         expenditures. The amount of any and all expenditures made by the
         Administrative Agent for the foregoing purposes shall be due and
         payable to the Lenders upon demand and accrue interest at a rate two
         percent (2%) per annum above the rate then applicable under the
         Construction Loan Notes (or that would be applicable under the
         Construction Loan Notes if they were still outstanding). Neither the
         Borrower nor any Guarantor shall be liable to the Lenders for the cost
         of completing the Improvements to the extent that the aggregate cost of
         completing the Improvements exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, provided
         the entire principal of and interest on the Construction Loan Advances
         shall have been paid in full. The obligations and liability of the
         Guarantors under this Section 2(b) shall not be limited or restricted
         by the existence of (or any limitation on) the guaranty of payment
         under Section 2(a). For the purposes hereof, all of the Obligations of
         the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under the Loan
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including all of the
         Obligations specified in Section 2(a) and this Section 2(b), shall be
         hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations".

                  (c)      Bankruptcy Limitations on Guarantors. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained in paragraph (a) above, it is the
         intention of each Guarantor and the Lenders that, in any proceeding
         involving the bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of
         debts, relief of debtors, dissolution or insolvency or any similar
         proceeding with respect to any Guarantor or its assets, the amount of
         such Guarantor's obligations with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations
         shall be in, but not in excess of, the maximum amount thereof not
         subject to avoidance or recovery by operation of any Applicable
         Insolvency Laws. To that end, but only in the event and to the extent
         that such Guarantor's obligations with respect to the Guaranteed
         Obligations or any payment made pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations
         would, but for the operation of the first sentence of this Section
         2(c), be subject to avoidance or recovery in any such proceeding under
         Applicable Insolvency Laws, the amount of such Guarantor's obligations
         with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to the
         largest amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not, under
         Applicable Insolvency Laws, render such Guarantor's obligations with
         respect to such Guaranteed Obligations unenforceable or avoidable or
         otherwise subject to recovery under Applicable Insolvency Laws. To the
         extent any payment actually made pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations
         exceeds the limitation of the first sentence of this Section 2(c) and
         is otherwise subject to avoidance and recovery in any such proceeding
         under Applicable Insolvency Laws, the amount subject to avoidance shall
         in all events be limited to the amount by which such actual payment
         exceeds such limitation and the Guaranteed Obligations as limited by
         the first sentence of this Section 2(c) shall in all events remain in
         full force and effect

                                       14

<PAGE>

         and be fully enforceable against such Guarantor. The first sentence of
         this Section 2(c) is intended solely to preserve the rights of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder against such Guarantor in such
         proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Insolvency
         Laws and neither such Guarantor, the Borrower, any other guarantor nor
         any other Person shall have any right or claim under such sentence that
         would not otherwise be available under Applicable Insolvency Laws in
         such proceeding.

                  (d)      Mutual Grant of Present Right of Contribution and
         Indemnity. To the extent that the value as of the time of execution of
         this Guaranty of the benefits received by any Guarantor by reason of
         matters stated in the preamble (whether determined under a standard of
         "fair value," "reasonably equivalent value" or any other valuation
         standard under Applicable Law) is less than the sum of the Guaranteed
         Obligations incurred by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and
         the Lenders plus such Guarantor's liability under this Section 2(d),
         then subject only to Section 15 hereof and in addition to all other
         rights and remedies such Guarantor has or may have under Applicable
         Law, each remaining Guarantor respectively agrees that such Guarantor
         has the present right to recover the amount of such excess from the
         remaining Guarantors, which right shall be enforceable jointly and
         severally against the remaining Guarantors to the full extent that the
         Guaranteed Obligations are enforceable against such Guarantor. Without
         limiting the foregoing, in the event any Guarantor is required, by
         reason of this Guaranty, to pay an amount in excess of the value of the
         benefit such Guarantor is deemed to have received by reason of matters
         described in the preamble of this Guaranty, the remaining Guarantors
         jointly and severally agree to pay such Guarantor, upon demand, the
         amount of such excess. Subject only to the provisions of Section 15
         hereof, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to any and all rights of the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders against the remaining Guarantors
         to the extent of such excess payment.

         SECTION 3.        Nature of Guaranty. Each Guarantor agrees that this
Guaranty is a continuing, unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and
not of collection, and that its obligations under this Guaranty shall be
primary, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by:

                  (a)      the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability
         or any future amendment of, or change in, this Guaranty, the Loan
         Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other agreement, document
         or instrument to which the Borrower, any Subsidiary thereof or any
         Affiliate thereof is or may become a party;

                  (b)      the absence of any action to enforce this Guaranty,
         the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent
         by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any of the
         provisions of this Guaranty, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan
         Document;

                                       15

<PAGE>

                  (c)      the existence, value or condition of, or failure to
         perfect its Lien against, any security (including, without limitation,
         the Collateral) for or other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations or
         any action, or the absence of any action, by the Administrative Agent
         or any Lender in respect of such security or guaranty (including,
         without limitation, the release of any such security or guaranty);

                  (d)      any structural change in, restructuring of or other
         similar change of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or

                  (e)      any other action or circumstances which might
         otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
         surety or guarantor;

it being agreed by each Guarantor that, subject to the first sentence in Section
2(c) hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty shall not be discharged until
the final indefeasible payment and performance, in full, of the Guaranteed
Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitment. To the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, each Guarantor expressly waives all rights it may
now or in the future have under any statute (including, without limitation,
North Carolina General Statutes Section 26-7, et seq. or similar law), or at law
or in equity, or otherwise, to compel the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
proceed in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations against the Borrower or any
other party or against any security (including, without limitation, the
Collateral) for or other guaranty of the payment and performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to
proceeding against, such Guarantor. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
each Guarantor further expressly waives and agrees not to assert or take
advantage of any defense based upon the failure of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to commence an action in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations
against the Borrower, such Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or
any security (including, without limitation, the Collateral) for the payment and
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor agrees that any notice
or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent or any Lender which
is inconsistent with the waivers in the preceding two sentences shall be null
and void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and, in
addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation
relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction
would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders have specifically agreed otherwise
in writing. The foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction
contemplated by the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents and, but for
this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders would
decline to enter into the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.        Demand by the Administrative Agent. In addition to
the terms set forth in Section 3 hereof, and in no manner imposing any
limitation on such terms, if all or any portion of the then outstanding
Guaranteed Obligations under the Loan Agreement are declared to be immediately
due and payable, then the Guarantors shall, upon demand in writing therefor by
the Administrative Agent to the Guarantors, pay all or such portion of the
outstanding Guaranteed Obligations then declared due and payable. Payment by the
Guarantors shall be

                                       16

<PAGE>

made to the Administrative Agent, to be credited and applied upon the Guaranteed
Obligations, in immediately available Dollars to an account designated by the
Administrative Agent or at the address referenced herein for the giving of
notice to the Administrative Agent or at any other address that may be specified
in writing from time to time by the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 5.        Waivers. In addition to the waivers contained in
Section 3 hereof, each Guarantor, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waives and agrees that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead or in any
manner whatever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any appraisal,
valuation, stay, extension, marshalling of assets or redemption laws, or
exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay,
prevent or otherwise affect the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations
under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of, this
Guaranty. Each Guarantor further hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, diligence, presentment, demand, protest and notice (except as
specifically required herein) of whatever kind or nature with respect to any of
the Guaranteed Obligations and waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the benefit of all provisions of law which are or might be in conflict with
the terms of this Guaranty. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that
its obligations under this Guaranty are not and shall not be subject to any
counterclaims, offsets or defenses of any kind against the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders or the Borrower whether now existing or which may arise in the
future.

         SECTION 6.        Benefits of Guaranty. The provisions of this Guaranty
are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their
respective permitted successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing
herein contained shall impair, as between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents. In
the event all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations are transferred,
endorsed or assigned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Person or
Persons as permitted under the Loan Agreement, any reference to the
"Administrative Agent", or the "Lenders" herein shall be deemed to refer equally
to such Person or Persons.

         SECTION 7.        Modification of Loan Documents etc. If the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall at any time or from time to time, with
or without the consent of, or notice to, the Guarantors:

                  (f)      change or extend the manner, place or terms of
         payment of, or renew or alter all or any portion of, the Guaranteed
         Obligations;

                  (g)      take any action under or in respect of the Loan
         Agreement or the other Loan Documents in the exercise of any remedy,
         power or privilege contained therein or available to it at law, in
         equity or otherwise, or waive or refrain from exercising any such
         remedies, powers or privileges;

                  (h)      amend or modify, in any manner whatsoever, the Loan
         Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

                                       17

                  (i)      extend or waive the time for performance by any
         Guarantor, any other guarantor, the Borrower or any other Person of, or
         compliance with, any term, covenant or agreement on its part to be
         performed or observed under the Loan Agreement or any other Loan
         Document, or waive such performance or compliance or consent to a

         the Lenders have been granted a Lien, to secure any Debt of any
         Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower to the Administrative
         Agent or the Lenders;

                  (k)      release anyone who may be liable in any manner for
         the payment of any amounts owed by any Guarantor, any other guarantor
         or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender;

then neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability
to any Guarantor as a result thereof, and no such action shall impair or release
the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty.

hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation
or surrender), this Guaranty (and such Lien) shall be reinstated in full force
and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender

                                       18

obligations of such Guarantor in respect of the amount of such payment (or any
Lien securing such obligation).

         SECTION 9.        Representations and Warranties.

         (a)      Representations and Warranties. To induce the Lenders to make
the Construction Loan Advances, each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders both before and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated under the Loan Agreement:

                  (i)      Ownership. Each Subsidiary and each Hospital Joint
         Venture owned by the Parent, either directly or indirectly, is listed
         on Schedule 9(a)(i) (as updated from time to time pursuant to Section
         11(j)). As of the Closing Date, the capitalization of the Parent, its
         Subsidiaries and each Hospital Joint Venture consists of the number of
         shares or other ownership interests, authorized, issued and
         outstanding, of such classes and series, with or without par value,
         described on Schedule 9(a)(i). All outstanding shares or other
         ownership interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and
         are fully paid and nonassessable, with no personal liability attaching
         to the ownership thereof, and not subject to any preemptive or similar
         rights. The shareholders of the Subsidiaries and the Hospital Joint
         Ventures owned by the Parent, either directly or indirectly, and the
         number of shares or other ownership interests owned by each as of the
         Closing Date are described on Schedule 9(a)(i). As of the Closing Date,
         there are no outstanding stock purchase warrants, subscriptions,
         options, securities, instruments or other rights of any type or nature
         whatsoever, which are convertible into, exchangeable for or otherwise
         provide for or permit the issuance of capital stock or other ownership
         interests of the Parent, any Subsidiary, or any Hospital Joint Venture
         except as described on Schedule 9(a)(i).

                  (ii)     Organization; Power; Qualification. Each Guarantor is
         duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has the power and
         authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now
         being and hereafter proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified and
         authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character
         of its properties or the nature of its business requires such
         qualification and authorization, except where the failure to so qualify
         could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
         jurisdictions in which each Guarantor is organized and qualified to do
         business as of the Closing Date are described on Schedule 9(a)(ii) (as
         updated from time to time pursuant to Section 11(j)).

                  (iii)    Authorization of Guaranty and Loan Documents. Each
         Guarantor has the corporate or limited liability company right, power
         and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty and each of
         the other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party and has
         taken all necessary corporate or limited liability company action to
         authorize its execution, delivery and

                                       19

<PAGE>

         performance of, this Guaranty and each of the other Loan Documents to
         which such Guarantor is a party.

                  (iv)     Enforceability of Guaranty and Loan Documents. This
         Guaranty and each of the other Loan Documents to which each Guarantor
         is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
         Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
         enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally and by the availability of equitable
         remedies.

                  (v)      Compliance with Laws, Etc. The execution, delivery
         and performance of this Guaranty and each of the other Loan Documents
         to which each Guarantor is a party will not violate any Applicable Law
         or contractual obligation of such Guarantor and will not result in the
         creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property
         or revenues of such Guarantor.

                  (vi)     Consents and Authorizations. No consent or
         authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any
         arbitrator or Governmental Authority and no consent of any other Person
         (including, without limitation, any stockholder or creditor of each
         Guarantor), is required in connection with the execution, delivery,
         performance, validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or any of the
         other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, other than the
         approval of the board of directors of each Guarantor (which approval
         has been obtained prior to the date hereof).

                  (vii)    Litigation. Except for matters set forth on Schedule
         9(a)(vii), no actions, suits or proceedings before any arbitrator or
         Governmental Authority are pending or, to the knowledge of each
         Guarantor, threatened by or against such Guarantor or against any of
         its properties with respect to this Guaranty, any other Loan Document
         or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby which could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (viii)   Title to Properties. Each Guarantor has such title to
         the real property owned by it and a valid leasehold interest in the
         real property leased by it, and has good and marketable title to all of
         its personal property sufficient to carry on its business free of any
         and all Liens of any type whatsoever.

                  (ix)     Solvency. As of the Closing Date (or such later date
         upon which such Guarantor became a party hereto), each Guarantor (A)
         has capital sufficient to carry on its business and transactions and
         all business and transactions in which it engages and is able to pay
         its debts as they mature, (B) owns property having a value, both at
         fair valuation and at present fair saleable value on a going concern
         basis, greater than the amount required to pay its probable liabilities
         (including contingencies) and (C) does not believe that it will incur
         debts or liabilities

                                       20

<PAGE>

         beyond its ability to pay such debts or liabilities as they mature,
         subject in each case to the first sentence in Section 2(c) hereof.

                  (x)      Financial Statements. The (A) audited Consolidated
         balance sheet of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of September 30,
         2001 and the related audited statements of income and retained earnings
         and cash flows for the Fiscal Year of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
         then ended and (B) unaudited Consolidated balance sheet of the Parent
         and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2002 and the related unaudited
         statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the
         fiscal quarter of the Parent and its Subsidiaries then ended, copies of
         which has been furnished to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, are
         complete and correct in all material respects and fairly present on a
         Consolidated basis the assets, liabilities and financial position of
         the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of its
         operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.

                  (xi)     No Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2001,
         there has been no Material Adverse Effect with respect to any Guarantor
         or the Guarantors taken as a whole, as applicable, and no event has
         occurred or condition arisen that could reasonably be expected to have
         a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (xii)    Tax Returns and Payments. Each Guarantor has duly
         filed or caused to be filed all federal, state, local and other tax
         returns required by Applicable Law to be filed, and has paid, or made
         adequate provision for the payment of, all federal, state, local and
         other material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
         upon it and its property, income, profits and assets which are due and
         payable, except for taxes (i) that are not yet delinquent or (ii) that
         are being contested in good faith and against which adequate reserves
         are being maintained in accordance with GAAP; such returns accurately
         reflect in all material respects all liability for taxes of such
         Guarantor for the periods covered thereby; there is no ongoing audit or
         examination or, to the knowledge of the such Guarantor, other
         investigation by any Governmental Authority of the tax liability of
         such Guarantor; no Governmental Authority has asserted any Lien or
         other claim against such Guarantor with respect to unpaid taxes which
         has not been discharged or resolved; and the charges, accruals and
         reserves on the books of such Guarantor in respect of federal, state,
         local and other taxes for all Fiscal Years and portions thereof since
         the organization of such Guarantor are in the judgment of such
         Guarantor adequate, and such Guarantor does not anticipate any
         additional material taxes or assessments for any of such periods.

                  (xiii)   Environmental Matters.

                           (A)      The properties owned, leased or operated by
                  each Guarantor now or in the past do not contain, and to its
                  knowledge have not previously contained, any Hazardous
                  Materials in amounts or concentrations which (1) constitute or
                  constituted a material violation of applicable Environmental

                  in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
                  Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about such
                  properties or such operations which could reasonably interfere
                  with the continued operation of such properties or impair the
                  fair saleable value thereof;

                           (C)      No Guarantor has received any notice of
                  violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or
                  potential liability regarding environmental matters, Hazardous
                  Materials, or compliance with Environmental Laws from (A) any
                  Governmental Authority or (B) to the extent any such
                  violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or
                  potential liability could reasonably be expected to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect, any other Person, nor does any
                  Guarantor have knowledge or reason to believe that any such
                  notice will be received or is being threatened;

                           (D)      Hazardous Materials have not been
                  transported or disposed of to or from the properties owned,
                  leased or operated by of any Guarantor in violation of, or in
                  a manner or to a location which could give rise to a material
                  liability under, Environmental Laws, nor have any Hazardous
                  Materials been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at,
                  on or under any of such properties in violation of, or in a
                  manner that could give rise to a material liability under, any
                  applicable Environmental Laws;

                           (E)      No judicial proceedings or governmental or
                  administrative action is pending, or, to the knowledge of any
                  Guarantor, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which
                  such Guarantor is or will be named as a potentially

                  (xiv)    ERISA.

                           (A)      The Parent and each ERISA Affiliate is in
                  material compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA
                  and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder
                  with respect to all Employee Benefit Plans except for any
                  required amendments for which the remedial amendment period as
                  defined in Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired and
                  except where a failure to so comply could not reasonably be
                  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee
                  Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
                  401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue
                  Service to be so qualified, and each trust related to such
                  plan has been determined to be exempt under Section 501(a) of
                  the Code except for such plans that have not yet received
                  determination letters but for which the remedial amendment
                  period for submitting a determination letter has not yet
                  expired. No liability has been incurred by the Parent or any
                  ERISA Affiliate which remains unsatisfied for any taxes or
                  penalties with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or any
                  Multiemployer Plan except for a liability that could not
                  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                           (B)      As of the Closing Date, no Pension Plan has
                  been terminated, nor has any accumulated funding deficiency
                  (as defined in Section 412 of the Code) been incurred (without
                  regard to any waiver granted under Section 412 of the Code),
                  nor has any funding waiver from the Internal Revenue Service
                  been received or requested with respect to any Pension Plan,
                  nor has the Parent or any ERISA Affiliate failed to make any
                  contributions or to pay any amounts due and owing as required
                  by Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or the terms
                  of any Pension Plan prior to the due dates of such
                  contributions under Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
                  ERISA, nor has there been any event requiring any disclosure
                  under Section 4041(c)(3)(C) or 4063(a) of ERISA with respect
                  to any Pension Plan;

                           (C)      Except where the failure of any of the
                  following representations to be correct in all material
                  respects could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
                  Adverse Effect, neither the Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate
                  has: (1) engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction
                  described in Section 406 of the ERISA or Section 4975 of the
                  Code, (2) incurred any liability to the PBGC which remains
                  outstanding other than the payment of premiums and there are
                  no premium payments which are due and unpaid, (3) failed to
                  make a required contribution or payment to a Multiemployer
                  Plan, or (4) failed to make a required installment or other
                  required payment under Section 412 of the Code;

                           (D)      No Termination Event has occurred or is
                  reasonably expected to occur; and

<PAGE>

                           (E)      Except where the failure of any of the
                  following representations to be correct in all material
                  respects could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
                  Adverse Effect, no proceeding, claim (other than a benefits
                  claim in the ordinary course of business), lawsuit and/or
                  investigation is existing or, to the best knowledge of the
                  Parent after due inquiry, threatened concerning or involving
                  any (1) employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section
                  3(1) of ERISA) currently maintained or contributed to by the
                  Parent or any ERISA Affiliate, (2) Pension Plan or (3)
                  Multiemployer Plan.

                  (xv)     Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written
         information, reports, statements and other papers and data produced by
         or on behalf of the Parent or any Subsidiary thereof and furnished to
         the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this
         Guaranty, or any of the other Loan Documents, were, at the time the
         same were so furnished, complete and correct in all material respects
         to the extent necessary to give the Administrative Agent or any Lender
         complete, true and accurate knowledge of the subject matter based on
         Parent's knowledge thereof (other than projections, budgets or other
         estimates which shall be determined in good faith utilizing reasonable
         assumptions). No document furnished or written statement made to the
         Administrative Agent or the Lenders by the Parent or any Subsidiary

         untrue statement of a fact material to the creditworthiness of the
         Parent or its Subsidiaries or omits or will omit to state a fact
         necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
         misleading to the extent material to the creditworthiness of the Parent
         or its Subsidiaries. The Parent is not aware of any facts which it has
         not disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent having a Material
         Adverse Effect, or insofar as the Parent can now foresee, which could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

representations and warranties made under this Guaranty shall be made or deemed
to be made at and as of the Closing Date (except those that are expressly made

by the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Lenders or any borrowing hereunder.

otherwise permitted under this Guaranty, the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with any of their Affiliates on terms that are fair and reasonable and

         above); provided that MedCath Incorporated shall not be required to
         make such Working Capital Advances to the extent that the sum of (A)
         the aggregate amount of such Working Capital Advances plus (B) the
         aggregate amount of Subordinated Working Capital Loans outstanding as
         of any applicable date of determination would exceed $8,000,000; and

                  (iii)    Cause all Working Capital Advances to be subordinated
         pursuant to an Intercompany Loan Subordination Agreement in form and

have been paid and satisfied in full and the Commitments of the Lenders under
the Loan Agreement have been

                                       30

         forth in Section 5.02 of the Corporate Revolver (as such agreement may
         be amended from time to time) as if such Section 5.02 of the Corporate
         Revolver (including, without limitation, each defined term, article,
         section, exhibit or schedule referenced in or relating to such Section
         5.02 of the Corporate Revolver) was written herein; provided that the
         aggregate amount of Debt permitted under Section 5.02(b)(iii) of the
         Corporate Revolver (including any amendment, restatement, refinancing
         or replacement thereof, the "Corporate Revolver Debt") shall not exceed

                                       32

<PAGE>

         Loan Agreement) shall be secured on a pari passu basis with the
         Corporate Revolver Debt or (B) the Corporate Revolver Debt shall be
         unsecured; and

                  (ii)     Notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
         promptly upon the execution of any amendment, restatement, supplement
         or other modification to the Corporate Revolver.

         (b)      Rules of Construction.

                  (i)      The terms and conditions of the Corporate Revolver
         which are incorporated in this Guaranty by reference shall continue as
         such terms and conditions are set forth in the Corporate Revolver
         irrespective of any termination of the Corporate Revolver. Such terms
         and conditions shall include any amendments, restatements, supplements
         or other modifications which are approved by the Required Lender
         pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii).

                  (ii)     All definitions and other provisions of the Corporate
         Revolver which are incorporated herein by reference shall be construed
         in such a manner so as to give such incorporated terms legal effect and
         meaning hereunder. More specifically, any references to the terms
         defined in both the Corporate Revolver and this Guaranty shall be
         deemed references to such terms as defined herein; provided that any
         references to the "Borrower" and the "Parent" in the Corporate Revolver
         shall be deemed to be references to MedCath Intermediate Holdings, Inc.
         and MedCath Holdings, Inc. hereunder. For example, references in the
         Corporate Revolver to the "Loan Documents", the "Commitments", the
         "Obligations", the "Administrative Agent" and the "Lenders" shall be
         deemed to be references to the Loan Documents, the Commitments, the
         Obligations, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as defined in
         this Guaranty, in each case to the extent necessary to give any such
         incorporated provisions legal effect and meaning hereunder. In
         addition, any references to defined terms in the Corporate Revolver
         which are similarly defined in this Guaranty shall be deemed references
         to such similar terms as defined herein. For example, references in the
         Corporate Revolver to an "Advance" shall be deemed to be references to
         a "Construction Loan Advance" hereunder, in each case to the extent
         necessary to give any such incorporated provisions legal effect and
         meaning hereunder.

         SECTION 14.       Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default, with the consent of the Required
Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required
Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, enforce against the Guarantors their
respective obligations and liabilities hereunder and exercise such other rights
and remedies as may be available to the Administrative Agent hereunder, under
the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents or otherwise.

         SECTION 15.       No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or
payments by any of the Guarantors hereunder, or any set-off or application of
funds of any of the Guarantors by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
receipt of any amounts by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations, none of the Guarantors shall be entitled to
be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender

                                       33

<PAGE>

against the Borrower or the other Guarantors or any other guarantor or against
any collateral security (including, without limitation, the Collateral) held by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations nor shall any of the Guarantors seek any reimbursement from the
Borrower or any of the other Guarantors in respect of payments made by such
Guarantor in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, until all amounts owing
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on account of the Guaranteed
Obligations are paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment is terminated. If any
amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at
any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in
full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such
Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over
to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly
endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required) to be
applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in
such order as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

         SECTION 16.       Expenses. All costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees, legal expenses and court costs) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing or protecting their rights or
remedies hereunder shall be payable by the Guarantors on demand and shall bear
interest (after as well as before judgment) until paid at the interest rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Loan Agreement and shall be additional
Guaranteed Obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 17.       Notices. All notices and communications hereunder
shall be made in accordance with Section 12.1 of the Loan Agreement; provided
that notices and communications to the Guarantors shall be directed to the
Guarantors at the address of the Parent set forth in Section 12.1 of the Loan
Agreement.

         SECTION 18.       Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty is for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their permitted
successors and assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding on each Guarantor and its
successors and assigns; provided that no Guarantor may assign any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders.

         SECTION 19.       Amendments, Waivers and Consents. No term, covenant,
agreement or condition of this Guaranty may be amended or waived, nor may any
consent be given, except in the manner set forth in Section 12.11 of the Loan
Agreement.

         SECTION 20.       Powers Coupled with an Interest. All authorizations
and agencies herein contained with respect to the Collateral are irrevocable and
powers coupled with an interest.

         SECTION 21.       Governing Law. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CONFLICTS OR CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF; PROVIDED, THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN
ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         SECTION 22.       Jurisdiction and Venue.

         (a)      Jurisdiction. The Guarantors hereby irrevocably consent to the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Mecklenburg
County, North Carolina, in any action, claim or other proceeding arising out of
any dispute in connection with this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents, any
rights or obligations hereunder, or the performance of such rights and
obligations. The Guarantors hereby irrevocably consent to the service of a
summons and complaint and other process in any action, claim or proceeding
brought by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this
Guaranty any the other Loan Documents, any rights or obligations hereunder, or
the performance of such rights and obligations, on behalf of itself or its
property, in the manner specified in Section 12.1 of the Loan Agreement. Nothing
in this Section 22 shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law or
affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring any action
or proceeding against any Guarantor or its properties in the courts of any other
jurisdictions.

         (b)      Venue. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection
it may have now or in the future to the laying of venue in the aforesaid
jurisdiction in any action, claim or other proceeding arising out of or in
connection with this Guaranty, any other Loan Document or the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives, in
connection with such action, claim or proceeding, any plea or claim that the
action, claim or other proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         SECTION 23.       Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS
GUARANTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS GUARANTY OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR
ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS GUARANTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 23 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY.

         SECTION 24.       Injunctive Relief; Punitive Damages.

         (a)      Injunctive Relief. Each Guarantor recognizes that, in the
event such Guarantor fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its
obligations or liabilities under this Guaranty, any remedy of law may prove to
be inadequate relief to the Lenders. Therefore, each Guarantor agrees that the
Lenders, at the Lenders' option, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual
damages.

                                       35

<PAGE>

         (b)      Punitive Damages. Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not have
a remedy of punitive or exemplary damages against any other party to a Loan
Document and each such Guarantor hereby waives any right or claim to punitive or
exemplary damages that it may now have or which may arise in the future in
connection with any dispute, whether the dispute is resolved by arbitration or
judicially.

         SECTION 25.       Severability. If any provision hereof is invalid and
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
(a) the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such
jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders in order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto
as nearly as may be possible; and (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provisions hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 26.       Headings. The various headings of this Guaranty are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Guaranty or any provisions hereof.

         SECTION 27.       Counterparts. This Guaranty may be executed by the
parties hereto in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which shall constitute together but one and the same
agreement.

         SECTION 28.       Accounting Matters. All financial and accounting
calculations, measurements and computations made for any purpose relating to
this Guaranty, including, without limitation, all computations utilized by the
Guarantors to determine compliance with any covenant contained herein, shall,
except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby or unless there is an express
written direction by the Administrative Agent to the contrary agreed to by the
Parent, be performed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the Closing Date.
In the event that changes in GAAP shall be mandated by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or any similar accounting body of comparable standing, or shall
be recommended by the Parent's certified public accountants, to the extent that
such changes would modify such accounting terms or the interpretation or
computation thereof, such changes shall be followed in defining such accounting
terms only from and after the date the Parent and the Required Lenders shall
have amended this Guaranty to the extent necessary to reflect any such changes
in the financial covenants and other terms and conditions of this Guaranty.

<PAGE>

                        Officer's Compliance Certificate

         The undersigned, on behalf of MedCath Corporation, a corporation
organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Parent"), hereby certifies to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, each as defined below, as follows:

         1.       This Certificate is delivered to you pursuant to Section 10(b)
of the Guaranty Agreement dated as of November 7, 2002 (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Guaranty Agreement"),
made by the Parent and certain Subsidiaries of the Parent who are or may become
party thereto (collectively, the "Guarantors"), in favor of Bank of America,
N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent") for the ratable
benefit of itself and the financial institutions (collectively, the "Lenders")
from time to time party to the Loan Agreement referred to therein. Capitalized
terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned
thereto in the Guaranty Agreement.

         2.       I have reviewed the financial statements of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries dated as of _______________ and for the _______________ period[s]
then ended and, to the best of my knowledge, such statements fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of the dates indicated and the results of their operations and cash flows for
the period[s] indicated.

         3.       I have reviewed the terms of the Guaranty Agreement, the Loan
Agreement, and the other related Loan Documents and have made, or caused to be
made under my supervision, a review in reasonable detail of the transactions and
the condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries during the accounting period
covered by the financial statements referred to in Paragraph 2 above. Such
review has not disclosed, to my knowledge, the existence during or at the end of
such accounting period of any condition or event that constitutes a Default or
an Event of Default, nor do I have any knowledge of the existence of any such
condition or event as at the date of this Certificate [except, if such condition
or event existed or exists, describe the nature and period of existence thereof
and what action the Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken, are taking and
propose to take with respect thereto].

         4.       The Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
financial covenants contained in Section 12 of the Guaranty Agreement as shown
on such Schedule 1 and the Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the other covenants and restrictions contained in the Guaranty Agreement.
