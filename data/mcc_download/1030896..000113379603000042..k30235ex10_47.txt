                                     WARRANT


                       TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK


                                       OF


                                  BLUEFLY, INC.


         THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT SFM DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS LLC, or its registered
assigns (the "Holder"), is the owner of the right to subscribe for and to
purchase from BLUEFLY, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), 792 (the
"Number Issuable"), fully paid, duly authorized and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock at a price per share equal to $1.12 (the "Exercise Price"), at any
time, in whole or in part, on or after January 28, 2003 (the "Effective Date")
through 5:00 PM New York City time, on January 27, 2007 (the "Expiration Date")
all on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth (the

<PAGE>

            Section 1. Exercise of Warrants.

               (a) Subject to the last paragraph of this Section 1, the Warrants
evidenced hereby may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the Holder hereof at
any time or from time to time, on or after the Effective Date and on or prior to
the Expiration Date upon delivery to the Company at the principal executive
office of the Company in the United States of America, of (A) this Warrant
Certificate, (B) a written notice stating that such Holder elects to exercise
the Warrants evidenced hereby in accordance with the provisions of this Section
1 and specifying the number of Warrants being exercised and the name or names in
which the Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued and (C) payment of the Exercise Price for such Warrants,
which shall be payable by (x) cash, or (y) certified or official bank check
payable to the order of the Company. The documentation and consideration, if
any, delivered in accordance with subsections (A), (B) and (C) are collectively
referred to herein as the "Warrant Exercise Documentation."

               (b) The Holder may elect to receive, without the payment by the
Holder of any additional consideration, shares equal to the value of this
Warrant or any portion hereof by the surrender of this Warrant or such portion
to the Company, with the net issue election notice annexed hereto duly executed,
at the office of the Company. Thereupon, the Company shall issue to the Holder
such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
computed using the following formula:

                                   X = Y (A-B)
                                       -------
                                          A

where

      X =   the number of shares to be issued to the Holder pursuant to this
            Section 1.

      Y =   the number of shares covered by this Warrant in respect of which
            the net issue election is made pursuant to this Section 1.

      A =   the Market Price of the Common Stock as of the date on which the
            net issue election is made pursuant to this Section 1.

      B =   the Exercise Price in effect under this Warrant at the time the
            net issue election is made pursuant to this Section 1.

            (c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of the Warrant Exercise Documentation, the Company
shall deliver or cause to be delivered (A) certificates representing the number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock specified
in the Warrant Exercise Documentation, (B) if applicable, cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share, as hereinafter provided, and (C) if less than the full
number of


                                       2
<PAGE>

Warrants evidenced hereby are being exercised, a new Warrant Certificate or
Certificates, of like tenor, for the number of Warrants evidenced by this
Warrant Certificate, less the number of Warrants then being exercised. Such
exercise shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date
of delivery of the Warrant Exercise Documentation so that the Person entitled to
receive shares of Common Stock upon such exercise shall be treated for all
purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at
such time.

            (d) The Company shall pay all expenses incurred by it in connection
with taxes and other governmental charges (other than income taxes of the
Holder) that may be imposed in respect of, the issue or delivery of any shares
of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced hereby. The
Company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax or other charge imposed
in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any certificate for
shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Warrant evidenced hereby.

            (e) In connection with the exercise of any Warrants evidenced
hereby, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu
thereof the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional
interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market
Price for one share of Common Stock on the Business Day which immediately
precedes the day of exercise. If more than one (1) such Warrant shall be
exercised by the holder thereof at the same time, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the
total number of Warrants so exercised.

        Section 2. Certain Adjustments.

            (a) The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment
as follows:

               (i) Stock Dividends, Subdivision, Combination or Reclassification
of Common Stock. If at any time after the date of the issuance of this Warrant
the Company shall (i) pay a dividend on Common Stock in shares of its Capital
Stock, (ii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, (iii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock as the case
may be, or (iv) issue by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any
shares of Capital Stock of the Company, then, on the record date for such
dividend or the effective date of such subdivision or split-up, combination or
reclassification, as the case may be, the number and kind of shares to be
delivered upon exercise of this Warrant will be adjusted so that the Holder will
be entitled to receive the number and kind of shares of Capital Stock that such
Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon or by reason of such
event had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto, and the
Exercise Price will be adjusted as provided below in paragraph 2(a)(v).

               (ii) Extraordinary Distributions. If at any time after the date
of issuance of this Warrant, the Company shall distribute to all holders of
Common Stock (including


                                       3
<PAGE>

any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which
the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation and Common Stock is not
changed or exchanged) cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other
assets (excluding (A) ordinary course cash dividends to the extent such
dividends do not exceed the Company's retained earnings and (B) dividends
payable in shares of Capital Stock for which adjustment is made under Section
2(a)(i), or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase securities
of the Company), then in each such case the number of shares of Common Stock to
be delivered to such Holder upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased so
that the Holder thereafter shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares such Holder would
have been entitled to receive immediately before such record date by a fraction,
the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price on such record date minus
the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors
of the Company in good faith) of the portion of the cash, evidences of
indebted-ness, securities or other assets so distributed or of such rights or
warrants applicable to one share of the Common Stock (provided that such
denominator shall in no event be less than $.01) and the numerator of which
shall be the Exercise Price.

               (iii) Reorganization, etc. If at any time after the date of
issuance of this Warrant any consolidation of the Company with or merger of the
Company with or into any other Person (other than a merger or consolidation in
which the Company is the surviving or continuing corporation and which does not
result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in par value
or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value, or as a
result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of Common Stock)
or any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company to any other person (each, a "Reorganization Event"), shall be
effected in such a way that the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive cash, stock, other securities or assets (whether such cash, stock, other
securities or assets are issued or distributed by the Company or another Person)
with respect to or in exchange for the Common Stock, then, upon exercise of this
Warrant, the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive only the kind and
amount of cash, stock, other securities or assets receivable upon such
Reorganization Event by a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock
that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon exercise of this
Warrant had this Warrant been exercised immediately before such Reorganization
Event, subject to adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 2(a). The Company
shall not enter into any of the transactions referred to in this Section
2(a)(iii) unless effective provision shall be made so as to give effect to the
provisions set forth in this Section 2(a)(iii).

               (iv) Carryover. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2(a), no adjustment shall be made to the number of shares of either
Common Stock to be delivered to the Holder (or to the Exercise Price) if such
adjustment represents less than 2% of the number of shares to be so delivered,
but any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time
and together with the next subsequent adjustment that together with any
adjustments so carried forward shall amount to 2% or more of the number of
shares to be so delivered.


                                       4
<PAGE>

               (v) Exercise Price Adjustment. Whenever the Number Issuable upon
the exercise of the Warrant is adjusted as provided pursuant to this Section
2(a), the Exercise Price per share payable upon the exercise of this Warrant
shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Number Issuable
upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and of
which the denominator shall be the Number Issuable immediately thereafter;
provided, however, that the Exercise Price for each Share of the Common Stock
shall in no event be less than the par value of a share of such Common Stock.

               (vi) Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the Number Issuable or the
Exercise Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly mail
by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder, notice of such adjustment
or adjustments setting forth the Number Issuable and the Exercise Price after
such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made.

            Section 3. No Redemption. The Company shall not have any right to
redeem any of the Warrants evidenced hereby.

            Section 4. Notice of Certain Events. In case at any time or from
time to time (i) the Company shall declare any dividend or any other
distribution to all holders of Common Stock, (ii) the Company shall authorize
the granting to the holders of Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe
for or purchase any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right,
(iii) the Company shall authorize the issuance or sale of any other shares or
rights which would result in an adjustment to the Number Issuable pursuant to
Section 2(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), (iv) there shall be any capital reorganization
or reclassification of Common Stock of the Company or consolidation or merger of
the Company with or into another Person, or any sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Company or (v) there shall be a voluntary
or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, then, in
any one or more of such cases the Company shall mail to the Holder at such
Holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Company, as promptly
as practicable but in any event at least 10 days prior to the date on which the
transactions contemplated in Section 2(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) a notice stating (a)
the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution, rights or warrants or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as
of which the holders of record of either Common Stock to be entitled to such
dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined or (b) the date
on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective. Such
notice also shall specify the date as of which it is expected that the holders
of record of the Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange the Common Stock for
shares of stock or other securities or property or cash deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

            Section 5. Certain Covenants. The Company covenants and agrees that
all shares of Capital Stock of the Company that may be issued upon the exercise
of the Warrants evidenced hereby will be duly authorized, validly issued and
fully paid and nonassessable. The Company


                                       5
<PAGE>

shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the exercise of
the Warrants, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the exercise of all
outstanding Warrants, and shall take all action required to increase the
authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at any time there shall be
insufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such
reservation or to permit the exercise of all outstanding Warrants.

            Section 6. Registered Holder. The persons in whose names this
Warrant Certificate is registered shall be deemed the owner hereof and of the
Warrants evidenced hereby for all purposes. The registered Holder of this
Warrant Certificate, in their capacity as such, shall not be entitled to any
rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company, except as herein provided.

            Section 7. Transfer of Warrants. Any transfer of the rights
represented by this Warrant Certificate shall be effected by the surrender of
this Warrant Certificate, along with the form of assignment attached hereto,
properly completed and executed by the registered Holder hereof, at the
principal executive office of the Company in the United States of America,
together with an appropriate investment letter and opinion of counsel, if deemed
reasonably necessary by counsel to the Company, to assure compliance with
applicable securities laws. Thereupon, the Company shall issue in the name or
names specified by the registered Holder hereof and, in the event of a partial
transfer, in the name of the registered Holder hereof, a new Warrant Certificate
or Certificates evidencing the right to purchase such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock then purchasable
hereunder.

            Section 8. Denominations. The Company covenants that it will, at its
expense, promptly upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate at the principal
executive office of the Company in the United States of America, execute and
deliver to the registered Holder hereof a new Warrant Certificate or
Certificates in denominations specified by such Holder for an aggregate number
of Warrants equal to the number of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate.

            Section 9. Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant Certificate and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, upon
delivery of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in the case of
an insurance company or other institutional investor, its own unsecured
indemnity agreement shall be deemed to be reasonably satisfactory), or, in the
case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof, the Company will
issue a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor for a number of Warrants equal to
the number of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate.

            Section 10. Governing Law. THIS WARRANT CERTIFICATE SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO

Certificate, and this Warrant Certificate shall be for the sole and exclusive
