                  FIRST AMENDMENT TO MARSH SUPERMARKETS, INC.
               1999 SENIOR EXECUTIVE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN


         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Marsh Supermarkets, Inc., an
Indiana corporation (the "Company"), has previously adopted the Marsh
Supermarkets, Inc. 1999 Senior Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (the
"Plan");

         WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Plan, the Company's Board of
Directors has retained the right to amend the Plan; and

         WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors now desires to amend the
Plan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and by resolution of
the Company's Board of Directors, the Plan is hereby amended as follows:

         1.       Section 6.2 of the Plan is hereby deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

                  6.2      Change in Control. Upon a Change in Control or at
         such other times as the Board of Directors may determine, the Company
         shall either place assets of the Company in a rabbi trust (the
         "Trust") or distribute assets to Participants or to trusts or other
         accounts designated by Participants. The determination as to whether
         assets are placed in the Trust or distributed to Participants (or to
         trusts or other accounts designated by Participants) shall be made by
         the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. The amount of assets to
         be placed in the Trust or distributed to Participants or to trusts or
         other accounts designated by Participants upon the occurrence of a
         Change in Control or at such other time as the Board may determine
         shall be an amount equal to the Supplemental Retirement Benefit of the
         Participants as of the effective date of any such determination or
         Change in Control, as determined by the actuary of the Retirement Plan
         using the assumptions contained in the definition of Actuarial
         Equivalent in the Retirement Plan for determining lump sum
         distributions after July 1, 1997. The Trust, if created, shall conform
         to the model form of rabbi trust agreement approved by the Internal
         Revenue Service in Revenue Procedure 92-64 (as amended from time to
         time) or in any successor thereto.

         2.       Except as expressly stated herein, all other sections of the
Plan remain in full force and effect.

         This First Amendment to the Marsh Supermarkets, Inc. 1999 Senior
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors of
the Company and became effective as of February 13, 2003.
