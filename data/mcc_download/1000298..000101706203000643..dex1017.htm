face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Purpose</u>.&#160; The purpose of this Plan is to enable the Sponsor and Affiliated Companies to provide a competitive
tax-deferred capital accumulation vehicle in order to attract and retain key management.</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Effective
Date and Term</u>.&#160; This Plan is effective as of February 1, 2000 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;), unless otherwise expressly provided herein.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Participation</u>.&#160; Participation in this Plan is open only to employees of the Sponsor or any Affiliated Company who meet
the requirements specified in Section 4.1 of the Plan and who are selected for participation in the Plan by the Committee.&#160; Participation in this Plan by any such employees, and the payment of any benefits under this Plan to any such employee,
shall be governed by the terms of this Plan and by the terms of the Participation Agreement entered into with respect to this Plan by the Company and such employee pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Participation Agreement</u>.&#160; As a condition to the commencement of participation in this Plan, each employee approved for
participation must enter into an agreement covering such employee&#146;s participation (a &#147;Participation Agreement&#148;) which agreement shall be executed by the Sponsor and such employee and, if such employee is employed by an Affiliated
Company, such Affiliated Company.&#160; Each Participation Agreement shall include such terms and conditions related to the employee&#146;s participation in the Plan as the Committee may deem appropriate.</font></p> <p><font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Applicability of ERISA</u>.&#160; This Plan is intended to be a &#147;top-hat&#148; plan -- that is, an unfunded plan maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of ERISA.&#160; As such, the Plan is exempt from the participation and vesting requirements of Part 2 of
Title I of ERISA, the funding requirements of Part 3 of Title&nbsp;I of ERISA, and the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA.</font></p>
