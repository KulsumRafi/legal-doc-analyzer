<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT made as of the 23rd day of April 1998, by and between General Instrument Corporation (the "Corporation"), and Thomas&nbsp;J. Lynch (the
"Executive"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the threat or the
occurrence of a Change in Control can result in significant distraction of the Corporation's key management personnel because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board has determined that it is essential and in the best interest of the Corporation and its stockholders for the Corporation to retain the services of the Executive in the
event of a threat or occurrence of a Change in Control and to ensure the Executive's continued dedication and efforts in such event without undue concern for the Executive's personal financial and
employment security; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Corporation, particularly in the event of a threat or the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Corporation
desires to enter into this Agreement with the Executive to provide the Executive with certain benefits in the event the Executive's employment is terminated under circumstances described herein. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective agreements of the parties contained herein, it is agreed as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term of Agreement.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall commence as of April&nbsp;23, 1998 (the "Effective Date"), and
shall continue in effect until December&nbsp;31, 1999 (the "Term"); provided, however, that on January&nbsp;1, 1999, and on each January&nbsp;1 thereafter, the Term shall automatically be
extended for one (1) year unless either the Executive or the Corporation shall have given written notice to the other at least ninety (90) days prior thereto that the Term shall not be so extended; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, further, however,
</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Term shall not expire prior to the expiration of twenty-four (24)
months after such occurrence. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the Term, the Executive's employment with the Corporation and its
Affiliates shall be terminated within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, the Executive shall be entitled to the following compensation and benefits: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Executive's employment with the Corporation and its Affiliates shall be terminated (1)&nbsp;by the Corporation for Cause or Disability, (2)&nbsp;by reason of
the Executive's death, or (3)&nbsp;by the Executive other than for Good Reason, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive his Accrued Compensation. In addition to the foregoing, if the Executive's
employment is terminated by the Corporation for Disability or by reason of the Executive's death, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive or his beneficiaries a Pro Rata Bonus. The Executive's
entitlement to any other compensation or benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's employee benefits plans and other applicable programs and practices then in effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Executive's employment with the Corporation and its Affiliates shall be terminated for any reason other than as specified in Section&nbsp;2(a), the Executive
shall be entitled to the following: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;for
eighteen (18) months after such termination (the "Continuation Period"), the Corporation shall at its expense continue on behalf of the Executive and his dependents
and beneficiaries the life insurance, disability, medical, dental and hospitalization coverages and benefits provided to the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control or, if greater, the
coverages and benefits provided at any time thereafter. The coverages and benefits (including deductibles and costs) provided in this Section&nbsp;2(b)(3) during the Continuation Period shall be no
less favorable to the Executive and his dependents and beneficiaries, than the most favorable of such coverages and benefits referred to above. The Corporation's obligation hereunder with respect to
the foregoing coverages and benefits shall be reduced to the extent that the Executive obtains any such coverages and benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's benefit plans, in which case the
Corporation may reduce any of the coverages or benefits it is required to provide the Executive hereunder so long as the aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined benefit plans is no less
favorable to the Executive than the coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder. In the event such coverages and benefits may not be continued (or where such continuation would adversely

the Executive's employment is terminated by the Corporation without Cause (1)&nbsp;within six (6) months prior to a Change in Control or (2)&nbsp;at any time
prior to the date of a Change in Control but the Executive reasonably demonstrates that such termination (A)&nbsp;was at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps
reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control (a "Third Party") and who effectuates a Change in Control or (B)&nbsp;otherwise arose in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in
Control which has been threatened or proposed and which actually occurs, such termination shall be deemed to have occurred after a Change in Control, provided a Change in Control shall actually have
occurred. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Gross-Up
Payment. In the event it shall be determined that any payment (other than the payment provided for in this Section&nbsp;2(d)) or distribution of
any type to or for the benefit of the Executive, by the Corporation, any Affiliate of the Corporation, any Person who acquires ownership or effective control of the Corporation or ownership of a
substantial portion of the Corporation's assets (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;2800 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder) or any
Affiliate of such Person, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Total Payments"), is or will be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are collectively referred to as
the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any income tax, employment tax or Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up
Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Total Payments. </FONT></P>

By Accountant. All mathematical determinations, and all determinations as to whether any of the Total Payments are "parachute payments" (within the meaning

amount of such Gross-Up Payment and amounts relevant to the last sentence of this Section&nbsp;2(d)(2), shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Executive from among the six
(6) largest accounting firms in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations regarding the
amount of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant matter, both to the Corporation and the Executive by no later than ten (10) days following the Termination Date, if applicable, or such earlier
time as is requested by the Corporation or the Executive (if </FONT></P>

the Executive reasonably believes that any of the Total Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish
the Executive and the Corporation with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Executive and the Corporation that no Excise Tax is payable (including the reasons therefor) and that the Executive has
substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal income tax return. If a Gross-Up Payment is determined to be payable, it shall be paid to the Executive within twenty (20) days after
the Determination (and all accompanying calculations and other material supporting the Determination) is delivered to the Corporation by the Accounting Firm. Any determination by the Accounting Firm
shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive, absent manifest error. As a result of uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments not made by the Corporation should have been made ("Underpayment"), or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made
by the Corporation which should not have been made ("Overpayments"). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred within
two (2) years. In the case of an Underpayment, the amount of such Underpayment (together with any interest and penalties payable by the Executive as a result of such Underpayment) shall be promptly
paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive. In the case of an Overpayment, the Executive shall, at the direction and expense of the Corporation, take such steps as are reasonably
necessary (including the filing of returns and claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures established by, the Corporation, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the
Corporation to correct such Overpayment, provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Corporation an amount greater than the net after-tax
portion of the Overpayment that he has retained or has recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities and (ii)&nbsp;this provision shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
intent of Section&nbsp;2(d)(1), which is to make the Executive whole, on an after-tax basis, from the application of the Excise Tax, it being understood that the correction of an Overpayment may
result in the Executive repaying to the Corporation an amount which is less than the Overpayment. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amounts provided for in Sections&nbsp;2(a) and 2(b)(l) and (2) shall be paid in a single lump sum cash payment within ten (10) days after the Executive's
Termination Date (or earlier, if required by applicable law). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such payment
shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive in any subsequent employment except as provided in Sections&nbsp;2(b)(3) and 2(b)(4). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
severance pay and benefits provided for in this Section&nbsp;2 shall be in lieu of any other severance pay to which the Executive may be entitled under any
