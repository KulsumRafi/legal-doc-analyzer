Dear Thaddeus:

I am pleased to offer you the position of CIO for Cingular Wireless, the joint

performance.

You will be eligible for an annual bonus. The 2001 standard bonus amount is
$200,000. The bonus payout ranges from 0-200% depending upon the company's
performance and your individual performance. The 2001 award will be paid out in
March, 2002.

You will also receive a special one-time grant of 35,000 BellSouth stock options

different levels of coverage so that you can build a benefits program that will
suit your individual situation. Coverage under BellSouth's Flexible Benefits
