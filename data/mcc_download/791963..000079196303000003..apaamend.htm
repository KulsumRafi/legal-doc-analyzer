        not enter into any settlement with respect to any such
        Tax Claim without Buyer's prior written consent, which

        Agencies for any other taxable period, without the
        consent of Buyer; (b) the Seller shall keep Buyer
        informed of all material developments and events relating

        <p>(iii) In connection with the contest of any Tax Claim

        Straddle Period and (c) any Tax Claim that the Seller has
        the ability to control pursuant to Section 3.05(d)(ii)
        but does not timely elect to control pursuant to such
        section, such contest shall be controlled by Buyer, and
        the Seller agrees to cooperate reasonably with Buyer in
        pursuing such contest. In connection with any such
        contest that relates to (b) or (c) above, Buyer shall
        keep the Seller informed of all material developments and
        events relating to such Tax Claim and the Seller, at its
        own cost and expense, shall have the right to participate
        (including participation in any relevant meetings) in
        (but not control) the defense of such Tax Claim. In the
        case of a Tax Claim described in (b) or (c) above, the
        Buyer shall consult with the Seller and shall not enter
        into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim
        without the prior written consent of the Seller, which
        consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>
        <p>(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        contained herein, the procedure for indemnification
        claims with regard to Taxes or otherwise brought pursuant
        to this Section 3.05 shall be governed exclusively by
        this Section 3.05.</p>
        <p>(e) <u>Conflicts; Survival</u>. Notwithstanding any
        other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
        obligations of the parties hereto set forth in this
        Section 3.05 shall not be subject to any limitations
        contained in Article X; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
        that the representations and warranties contained in
        Section 4.15 shall survive the Brokerage Closing until
        (90) days following the expiration of the applicable
        statute or limitations (taking into account all
        extensions thereof); <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>, in
        the event that notice for indemnification under Section
        3.05(d) hereof shall have been given within the
        applicable survival period, the representation or
        warranty that is the subject of such indemnification
        claim shall survive until such time as such claim is
        finally resolved. In the event of a conflict between this
        Section 3.05 and any other provision of this Agreement,
        this Section 3.05 shall govern and control.</p>
        <p>(f) <u>Tax Treatment</u>. The parties hereto agree,
        unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, to treat any
        payment made pursuant to Article X or Section 3.05 as an
        adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
        purposes.&quot;</p>
        <p>Sections 3.05(c) and (d) will not change except that
        they will now read Sections 3.05(g) and (h),
        respectively.</p>

        and Records or any part thereof which are related to
        Seller's or Company's investment banking businesses,
        capital markets or any other business that is not

        in two places after the words &quot;originals of all

        &quot;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
        required to provide to Buyer copies of or access to any
        Tax Returns of Seller Parent or Company (including the
        consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of the

        common parent), except for the portion of such Tax
        Returns as shall related to the Brokerage Assets or the
        Insurance Agencies, as the case may be and which does not
        reveal any material information about the Seller that is
        not related to the Insurance Agencies or Brokerage
        Business. Buyer shall keep such Books and Records
        confidential to the extent it is required to do so by any
        Applicable Law.&quot; will be added at the end of Section

        set forth in such section) shall apply to Seller with
        respect to the consents related to the leases listed on
        Section&nbsp;4.06(b) of the <u>Seller Disclosure Schedule</u>;</p>
        <p>(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
        contrary, prior to obtaining the consents or approvals
        with respect to each real estate lease listed on Section

        therein and without giving effect to the language in

        all consents (other than real estate consents) where the
        failure to obtain such consents (the &quot;<u>Material
        Consents</u>&quot;) could have given Buyer the right not
        to close the transactions contemplated in the Agreement
        pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.01(g) thereof without giving
        effect to the carve out set forth therein;</p>

        real estate consent for the leases listed on
        Section&nbsp;4.06(b) of the <u>Seller Disclosure Schedule</u>
        and such subleases will be co-terminous with the
        underlying lease and include any reasonable provisions
        required by the landlord; and</p>
        <p>(f) With regard to the shared spaces subject to such
        subleases, Seller shall be responsible for the
        construction (including the cost thereof) of demising
        walls and/or reparations required by applicable
        regulatory requirements in order to permit Buyer and
        Seller to share such spaces and conduct their activities
        as pursued by them as of and immediately after the Broker
        Closing in accordance with such regulatory
        requirements.&quot;</p>

        the Seller Disclosure Schedules hereunder or Buyer's
        rights hereunder, Seller has agreed to provide to Buyer,
        by January 8, 2003, a true and correct schedule of Broker
        Loans as of December 31, 2002, and by January 15, 2003,

        broker assets (as they relate to the Brokerage Business)
        and the vesting schedules all as of December 31, 2002
        under the Wealth Plus Plan. For the purpose of the rights
        and obligations of the parties hereunder, any such
        additional or supplemental schedules shall not be deemed
        to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement
        or as of the Brokerage Closing Date and shall not in any
        way negatively affect the rights and remedies of Buyer in
        respect of the representations and warranties made by
        Seller on the date of the Agreement or this Amendment.</p>
        <p>Section 6.21 is added after Section 6.20 and will

        <p>&quot;6.21 <u>Adjustment of Zero Coupon Note</u>. (a)
        Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement
        (the &quot;<u>December Broker Notes Statement</u>&quot;),
        setting forth in reasonable detail, as of December 31,
        2002, the amortized amount outstanding for each Broker
        Loan. The December Broker Notes Statement shall be
        delivered to the Buyer no later than six (6) days after
        the Brokerage Closing Date. Immediately and
        automatically, without any further action on the part of
        either of Buyer or Seller, following the delivery of the
        December Broker Notes Statement, the principal sum of the
        Zero Coupon Note shall be either increased or decreased,
        as appropriate, to reflect the aggregate outstanding
        amount of Broker Loans as set forth on the December
        Broker Notes Statement. After such adjustment, for all
        intents and purposes, the principal sum of the Zero
        Coupon Note shall be equal to the aggregate amount of
        Broker Loans.</p>
        <p>(b) If any of the notes evidencing the Broker Loans
        (the &quot;<u>Broker Notes</u>&quot;) shall be assigned
        to Buyer after the Brokerage Closing Date (each such
        Broker Note, a &quot;<u>Post-closing Broker Note</u>&quot;),
        Seller and Buyer shall promptly increase the amount
        outstanding on the Zero Coupon Note equal to the
        amortized outstanding amount of such Post-closing Broker
        Note.&quot;</p>
        <p>Section 6.22 is added after Section 6.21 and will
        read:</p>
        <p>&quot;6.22 <u>Broker Notes Letter</u>. Buyer and
        Seller agree that they will abide by the terms of that
        certain letter dated December 30, 2002 (the &quot;<u>Broker
        Notes Letter</u>&quot;), from Buyer and Seller to the
        NYSE pursuant to which Buyer and Seller have agreed to
        revise documents, as may be necessary, relating to the
        Proposed Transaction (as defined in the Broker Notes
        Letter) by January 15, 2003 so that the Broker Loans will
        be contributed from Buyer to Fahnestock. In the event
        that such Broker Loans are contributed by Buyer to
        Fahnestock in accordance with the terms of the Broker
        Notes Letter, Seller shall (i) terminate the Broker Notes
        Pledge Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2003, between
        Buyer and Company, (ii) promptly deliver all Broker Notes
        to Buyer and (iii) execute and deliver, upon the
        reasonable request of Buyer and at Buyer's sole cost and
        expense, such further instruments and documents,
        including but not limited to termination statements under
        the Uniform Commercial Code, and to take such further
        actions as Buyer may reasonably request to fully effect
        the foregoing releases, terminations and
        discharges.&quot;</p>
        <p>Section 6.24 is added after Section 6.23 and will
        read:</p>
        <p>&quot;From and after the Brokerage Closing Date, if
        Seller determines, due to regulatory requirements, that
        the accounts of Seller's directors, officers and
        employees must be moved to Seller (or its representatives
        or agents), Seller shall notify Buyer, and Buyer shall
        cooperate with Seller in connection with moving such
        accounts, and Buyer and Seller agree that Seller's
        administration and maintenance of such accounts shall be
        deemed to not violate the terms of the Non-Competition
        Agreement.&quot;</p>
