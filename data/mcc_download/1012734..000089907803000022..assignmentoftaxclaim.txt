         1. For value  received,  the  receipt of which is hereby  acknowledged,
Assignor hereby sells,  assigns,  transfers and sets over to Assignee all monies
and claims from monies due and/or to become due to the Assignor  from the United

"Government"),  arising out of any  application  in the name of Assignor  for an
income  tax  refund  for any tax year,  filed or to be filed at any time or from
time to time by Assignor with the Internal Revenue Service,  including,  but not
limited to, the application in the name of Assignor for an income tax refund for
tax  year  2002  (individually,  a  "Tax  Refund"  and  collectively,  the  "Tax
Refunds").

         2. The Assignor  hereby  specifically  and  irrevocably  authorizes and
directs the Government to make all payments under any Tax Refund directly to the
Assignee  and hereby  irrevocably  authorizes  and empowers  the  Assignee,  and
appoints the Assignee,  its executors,  administrators and assigns, its true and
lawful  attorney  with  full  power  of  substitution  and  revocation,  as such
Assignee, to ask, demand, receive,  receipt and give acquittance for any and all
amounts  which may be or become due or  payable or remain  unpaid at any time or
times to the Assignor by the Government under and pursuant to any Tax Refund and
to endorse any checks,  drafts or other orders for the payment of money  payable
to the Assignor in payment thereof, and in the Assignee's discretion to file any
claims or to take any action or proceeding either in its own name or in the name
of the Assignor or otherwise, which to the Assignee may deem to be necessary and
advisable,  and to execute any  necessary  closing  agreement  and any necessary
waivers of the  statute  of  limitation.  It is  expressly  understood  that the
Assignee  shall  receive  copies  of  all   communications  and  proceedings  in
connection  with the aforesaid  claims,  but shall not be required or obliged in
any  manner  to make any  demand  or to make any  inquire  as to the  nature  or
sufficiency of any payment received by it, or to present or file any claim or to
take any other action to collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may
have been  assigned  to the  Assignee or to which the  Assignee  may be entitled
hereunder at any time or times.

         3.  Assignor  represents  and  warrants to Assignee  that (A) it is the
lawful  owner of all rights to the Tax  Refunds;  (B)  Assignor has the right to
assign the Tax  Refunds to  Assignee;  (C)  Assignor's  rights in and to the Tax
Refunds are free from all liens and encumbrances:  (D) Assignor will warrant and
defend  the Tax  Refunds  against  the claims and  demands  of all  persons  and
entities;  (E) no other  assignment of any Tax Refund has been made by Assignor;
and (F) this Assignment  constitutes a first and superior  assignment of the Tax
Refunds having priority over any other person or entity.

         4.  Assignor  agrees (A) that if any Tax Refund,  or any portion of any
Tax Refund, is paid to Assignor at any time or from time to time,  Assignor will
receive and hold the same in trust for Assignee and Assignor will forthwith upon
receipt of such Tax Refund  deliver such Tax Refund to Assignee in the identical
form of payment  received  by the  Assignor;  and (B) that it will  execute  and
deliver all such further instruments and due all such further acts and things as
Assignee  may  reasonably  request or shall be necessary or desirable to further
and more perfectly assure to Assignee its rights to the Tax Refunds.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Assignor has duly executed this  Assignment as of
the date first above written.
