applicable law. Any demand for arbitration must be made within 365 days of the date on which the dispute first arose (unless a longer period of time is required by law), or it will be deemed waived by both parties. Binding arbitration will be
conducted in Orange County, California in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. Executive understands and agrees that the arbitration shall be instead of any civil litigation and that this means that
Executive is waiving his right to a jury trial as to such claims. The parties further understand and agree that the arbitrator&#146;s decision shall be final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by law and enforceable by any court having
jurisdiction. The prevailing party in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this <U>Section 10(f)</U>, and any appeal therefrom or related thereto, or any litigation between Executive and the Company related to Executive&#146;s employment or
termination thereof or the Related Documents or other documents referenced in Section 10(c) that occurs notwithstanding this arbitration provision (all of the foregoing being referred to as &#147;<B>Proceedings</B>&#148;), shall be entitled to
recover from the non-prevailing party all costs incurred by the prevailing party in the Proceedings, including without limitation attorneys&#146; costs and fees. The identity of the prevailing party in any Proceeding will be determined by the
arbitrator or other trier of fact or tribunal in the Proceeding as the party most nearly achieving the result sought, although the arbitrator or other trier of fact or tribunal may decide in any Proceeding that there is no prevailing party if, on
the basis of all of the facts and circumstances, the interests of justice so require. In addition, the Company shall propose a reasonable set of rules to guide any Proceedings. Such rules shall be designed to lead to a prompt and just result without
undue delay or expense, but will not be unduly prejudicial to either party. If Executive agrees to such proposed rules and guidelines, the Company will pay on Executive&#146;s behalf or advance to Executive all of Executive&#146;s reasonable costs
incurred in the Proceedings. Executive&#146;s acceptance of such payments or advances will constitute Executive&#146;s agreement to reimburse the Company therefor if the Company is found by the arbitrator or other trier of fact or tribunal to be the
prevailing party in the Proceeding. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">(g)
