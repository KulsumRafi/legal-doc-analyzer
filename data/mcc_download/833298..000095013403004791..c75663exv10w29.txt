                       WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] of any
                       royalties received by CIMA from sales of the Product
                       under such license to a third party, provided that Alamo

             failure to successfully complete any of the development activities

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] per annum (which interest shall
accrue from the date any such deficiency payment is due), and shall reimburse

with their inspection for such period. In the event that any such inspection
reveals a deficiency that is less than [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION.***] of the reported royalty for the period covered by the
inspection, Alamo shall promptly pay CIMA the deficiency, plus interest at the

due). In the event that any such inspection reveals an overpayment, CIMA shall
promptly pay Alamo the overpayment. The parties agree that neither party shall
be required to retain books and records with respect to the above other than

CIMA's receipt of Alamo's Notice of Rejection. In the event that such Defective
Product, Defective Product samples or Defective Product placebos are due to: i)
faulty manufacture; faulty release; faulty primary packaging or labeling of the
relevant batch(es) of the Product; or ii) improper shipping to Alamo's
designated agent for final packaging, which fact shall be established on the

designated agent for final packaging, utilizing an outside independent
laboratory if necessary, the cost of which is borne by both parties and whose
findings shall be binding or on the basis of process deviation documentation
provided to Alamo, CIMA shall replace such batches free of charge, otherwise
Alamo shall promptly pay CIMA for all such Product, Product samples or Product
placebos, including any Defective Product.

designated agent of any Product, Product samples, or Product placebos CIMA shall

unless within such [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] period Alamo sends
notice of rejection to CIMA; provided, that payment of any invoice pursuant to
this Section 5.6 shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute acceptance of
any Product, Product samples or Product placebos or in any way limit Alamo's
rights to inspect and/or reject any of the foregoing pursuant to Section 5.5
hereof . Within [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED

Product, Product samples, or Product placebos Alamo or its designated agent
shall acknowledge the delivery of Product, Product samples, or Product placebos
and shall notify CIMA's shipping department of any obvious shipping damage;
provided, that failure to provided any such notice shall not constitute a waiver
or in any way limit Alamo's rights under Section 5.5 with respect to such
shipment. There will be a [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED

price, penalty per month, for each month a payment is past due. Such penalty

reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done all things necessary or proper to make effective the
transactions contemplated by this

                                      -20-

Agreement, including such actions as may be reasonably necessary to obtain
approvals and consents of governmental Persons and other Persons.

         9.7 Publicity. Except as expressly contemplated hereby, the parties
agree that no publicity release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued without the advance written consent of the
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as
such release or announcement may be required by law, including but not limited
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, in which case the party making the release or announcement
shall, before making any such release or announcement, afford the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such release or announcement;
provided, that the party making the release or announcement or otherwise
disclosing this Agreement to any governmental agency in accordance with the
foregoing exception shall use its best efforts to obtain confidential treatment
of the terms hereof to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

         9.8 Cooperation. If either party shall become engaged in or participate
in any investigation, claim, litigation or other proceeding with any third
party, including the FDA, relating in any way to the Product or any of the
Licensed Assets the other party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
such party in connection therewith, including, without limitation, using its
reasonable efforts to make available to the other such employees who may be
helpful with respect to such investigation, claim, litigation or other
proceeding, provided that, for purposes of this provision, reasonable efforts to
make available any employee shall be deemed to mean providing a party with
reasonable access to any such employee at no cost for a period of time not to
exceed 24 hours (e.g., three 8-hour business days). Thereafter, any such
employee shall be made available for such time and upon such terms and
conditions (including, but not limited to, compensation) as the parties may
mutually agree.

         9.9 Competition; No Sale for Resale. Neither Alamo nor any sub-licensee
of Alamo shall knowingly sell any Product to anyone in the Territory for
subsequent distribution or resale outside the Territory and each shall take all
reasonable precautions to prevent such distribution or resale outside the
Territory. Except as provided in 2.1(c), CIMA shall not knowingly sell any
Product to anyone in the Territory or outside the Territory for subsequent
distribution or resale in the Territory and CIMA shall take all reasonable
precautions to prevent such distribution or resale in the Territory.

         9.10 Conflicting Rights. CIMA shall not grant any right to any third
party relating to the Activities which would violate the terms of or conflict
with the rights granted to Alamo pursuant to this Agreement.

         9.11 Patent and Trademark Maintenance.

                  (a) CIMA hereby represents and warrants that, to the best of
         its knowledge, the CIMA Technology, when used with the Active
         Pharmaceutical Ingredient, includes all the technology, patents,
         know-how, trade secrets and other intellectual property necessary to
         manufacture the Product. Any improvement (whether or not patentable) in
         the technology used in manufacturing the Product shall be owned by the
         Party who discovers or invents such improvement.

                  (b) CIMA shall be solely responsible for filing, prosecuting,
         and maintaining all of the CIMA Patents, and CIMA shall pay the costs
         associated therewith. CIMA shall file, prosecute, and maintain all CIMA
         Patents so as to fully continue the benefits under the licenses granted
         to Alamo hereunder. CIMA may, however, discontinue prosecuting or
         maintaining any CIMA Patent if (i) CIMA has a valid business reason to
         do so, and (ii) CIMA notifies Alamo of this decision in which event,
         Alamo shall have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute or
         maintain any such patent, with the full cooperation of CIMA, in Alamo's
         name and at Alamo's expense.

                  (c) CIMA shall be solely responsible for filing, prosecuting,
         and maintaining all CIMA Trademarks, and CIMA shall pay the costs
         associated therewith. All registrations, variations, logos, goodwill
         and other rights under or acquired through use of the CIMA Trademarks
         shall accrue and belong to CIMA. Except as provided herein, Alamo shall
         have no rights to use the CIMA Trademarks. Alamo will not use in its
         business, in or outside of the Territory, any other mark or name which
         is similar to or nearly resembles any of the CIMA Trademarks in use by
         CIMA to indicate the source and origin of the CIMA Technology as to be
         likely to cause deception or confusion. Alamo recognizes that CIMA is
         the owner of all CIMA Trademarks used in commerce to indicate the
         source of the CIMA Technology and agrees that the CIMA Trademarks shall
         remain vested in CIMA both during the term of this Agreement and
         thereafter. Alamo shall not contest the validity of the CIMA Trademarks
         or CIMA's ownership of the CIMA Trademarks. Use of the CIMA Trademarks
         by Alamo in conjunction with the manufacture, use, and sale of the
         Product and all goodwill related thereto shall inure to the benefit of
         CIMA for purposes of building the longevity and extent of use of the
         CIMA Trademarks.

                  (d) Alamo shall be solely responsible for filing, prosecuting,
         and maintaining all trademarks it develops or owns for the Product (the
         "Alamo Trademarks"), and Alamo shall pay the costs associated
         therewith. All registrations, variations, logos, goodwill and other
         rights under or acquired through use of the Alamo Trademarks shall
         accrue and belong to Alamo. CIMA shall have no rights to use the Alamo
         Trademarks. CIMA will not use in its business, in or outside of the
         Territory, any other mark or name which is similar to or nearly
         resembles the Alamo

                                      -22-
<PAGE>



         Trademarks in use by Alamo in a manner that is likely to cause
         deception or confusion. CIMA recognizes that Alamo is the owner of all
         of the Alamo Trademarks used in commerce to indicate the source of the
         Product and agrees that the Alamo Trademarks shall remain vested in
         Alamo both during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. CIMA shall
         not contest the validity of the Alamo Trademarks or Alamo's ownership
         of the Alamo Trademarks. Use of the Alamo Trademarks by Alamo in
         conjunction with the manufacture, use, and sale of the Product and all
         goodwill related thereto shall inure to the benefit of Alamo for
         purposes of building the longevity and extent of use of the Alamo
         Trademarks.

                  (e) Alamo and CIMA agree that, where applicable and
         appropriate, all packaging of the Product shall identify (i) the number
         of the CIMA Patents and CIMA as the owner thereof and (ii) Alamo as the
         owner of the Alamo Trademarks.

                  (f) Any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding, Alamo acknowledges that, for all purposes, CIMA is the
         owner of the CIMA Technology.

         9.12 Infringement; Enforcement of Proprietary Rights.

                  (a) Infringement of Patent Rights. Each party shall promptly
         notify the other of any alleged infringement by third parties of any
         CIMA Patent and provide any information available to that party
         relating to such alleged infringement.

                           (i) Within a reasonable time (not to exceed 30 days)
                  following such notification, the parties shall meet to discuss
                  a desirable response to such infringement and enter into good
                  faith negotiations to determine an agreed upon course of
                  action to end such infringement and the appropriate allocation
                  of any costs or recoveries associated therewith.

                           (ii) If the parties are unable to agree upon the
                  course of action or the appropriate allocation of any costs
                  associated therewith, CIMA [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
                  REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
                  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] such alleged
                  infringement and [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION
                  OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
                  COMMISSION.***] any infringement of such rights that
                  materially affect Alamo's rights pursuant to this Agreement,
                  including, but not limited to, bringing suit against such
                  third party infringer. In the event that CIMA does not bring
                  suit against such third party infringer, Alamo may bring suit
                  against such third party infringer on CIMA's behalf and Alamo
                  [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED

                  [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION OMITTED FILED
                  SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] to
                  CIMA under this agreement.

                  (b) Procedures. No settlement, consent judgment or other
         voluntary final disposition of any suit contemplated by Section 9.12(a)
         may be entered into without the consent of each party, which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Unless otherwise agreed
         by the parties, to the extent that any suit contemplated by Section
         9.12(a) is directly related to the Product, any recovery of Damages to
         the extent related to the Product (net of the respective out-of-pocket
         legal fees and associated costs) in any such suit shall be allocated
         among the parties hereto assuming that such Damages constitute Net
         Sales by Alamo hereunder. In the event of any infringement suit against
         a third party brought by either party pursuant to this Section 9.12,
         the party not bringing such suit shall cooperate in all respects,
         execute any documents reasonably necessary to permit the other party to
         prosecute such suit, and to the extent reasonable, shall make available
         its employees and relevant records to provide evidence for such suit.

         9.13 Referral of Orders and Inquiries. Except as provided in 2.1(c),
CIMA shall refer all Persons sending orders or making inquiries regarding the
Product within the Territory to Alamo and shall promptly notify Alamo of the
name of each such Person and the nature of the inquiry of such Person.

                                   SECTION 10

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         10.1 Indemnification.

         (a) CIMA shall indemnify, defend and hold Alamo (and its directors,
officers, employees, and Affiliates) harmless from and against any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by Alamo (and its directors, officers, employees,
and Affiliates) as a consequence of:

                           (i) any breach of any representation, warranty
                  or covenant made by CIMA in this Agreement or any agreement,
                  instrument or document delivered by CIMA pursuant to the terms
                  of this Agreement;

                           (ii) any failure to perform to perform duly and
                           punctually any covenant, agreement or undertaking on
                           the part of Alamo contained in this Agreement; or


                                      -24-
<PAGE>



                           (iii) any act or omission of CIMA with respect to
                           the operation of CIMA's business, or handling,
                           manufacturing, or use of the Product by CIMA; or

                           (iv) any claim or demand that the manufacture,
                           use, sale or offer for sale of the Product by reason
                           of CIMA Technology infringes any United States or
                           foreign patent.

         (b) Alamo shall indemnify, defend and hold CIMA (and its
directors, officers, employees, and Affiliates) harmless from and against any
and all Damages incurred or suffered by CIMA (and its directors, officers,
employees, and Affiliates) as a consequence of:

                           (i) any breach of any representation, warranty
                  or covenant made by Alamo in this Agreement or any agreement,
                  instrument or document delivered by Alamo pursuant to the
                  terms of this Agreement;

                           (ii) any failure to perform to perform duly and
                           punctually any covenant, agreement or undertaking on
                           the part of Alamo contained in this Agreement; or

                           (iii) [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED,
                  PORTION OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
                  EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] of Alamo with respect to the
                  operation of Alamo's business or the handling, manufacturing,
                  sale, consumption or use of the Product by Alamo.

         10.2 Notice and Opportunity To Defend. Promptly after receipt by a
party hereto of notice of any claim which could give rise to a right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1. such party (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice describing
the claim in reasonable detail. The failure of an Indemnified Party to give
notice in the manner provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this Section, except to the extent that such failure to
give notice materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, to
compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter
involving the asserted liability of the party seeking such indemnification. If
the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to compromise or defend any such asserted
liability, it shall promptly (and in any event not less than 10 days after
receipt of the Indemnified Party's original notice) notify the Indemnified Party
in writing of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise or
defense against any such asserted liability. All reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party, as incurred by the Indemnified Party.

                                      -25-

<PAGE>



If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend the asserted
liability, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to compromise
or defend as herein provided, fails to admit its obligation to indemnify under
this Agreement with respect to the claim, or, if in the reasonable opinion of
the Indemnified Party, the claim could result in the Indemnified Party becoming
subject to injunctive relief or relief other than the payment of money damages
that could materially adversely affect the ongoing business of the Indemnified
Party in any manner, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option,
to pay, compromise or defend such asserted liability by its own counsel and its
reasonable costs and expenses shall be included as part of the indemnification
obligation of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any claim over the objection of the other. In any event, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party may participate, at their own
expense, in the defense of such asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents within its control that
are necessary or appropriate for such defense. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 10.2, (i) the party conducting the defense of a claim
shall (A) keep the other party informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to
the status of the defense of such claim (but only to the extent such other party
is not participating jointly in the defense of such claim), and (B) conduct the
defense of such claim in a prudent manner, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not cease to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of any claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Upon the final determination of liability and the amount
of the indemnification payment under this Section 10, the appropriate party
shall pay to the other, as the case may be, within 10 business days after such
determination, the amount of any claim for indemnification made hereunder.

         10.3 Survival. The provisions of Section 10 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. Each Indemnified Party's rights under Section 10
shall not be deemed to have been waived or otherwise affected by such
Indemnified Party's waiver of the breach of any representation, warranty,
agreement or covenant contained in or made pursuant this Agreement, unless such
waiver expressly and in writing also waives any or all of the Indemnified
Party's right under Section 10.

         10.4 Insurance. Alamo shall maintain throughout the term of this
Agreement comprehensive general liability insurance, including product liability
insurance underwritten by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to CIMA.
This insurance coverage shall provide protection of not less than ten ($10)
million, combined single limit for personal injury and property damage (on a per
occurrence basis) with CIMA named as an additional insured. Such liability
insurance shall be maintained on an occurrence basis to provide such protection
after expiration or termination of the policy itself and/or this Agreement.
Alamo shall furnish to CIMA certificates issued by the insurance company setting
forth the amount of the liability insurance and a provision that CIMA shall
receive thirty (30) days written notice prior to termination, reduction or
modification of coverage.

                                   SECTION 11

                                   TERMINATION

         11.1 Termination. The term of this Agreement shall begin upon the
Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, shall end
upon the expiration of the last CIMA Patent to expire or, if later, the
expiration of any other patent resulting from the development process
contemplated hereby. Upon expirationof this Agreement, CIMA will, if requested
by Alamo, grant Alamo on a royalty free basis a license to continue to use the
CIMA Intellectual Property formerly covered by the CIMA Patents for the
manufacture of Product and, should Alamo desire to have CIMA continue the
manufacture of Product beyond the [***CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED, PORTION
OMITTED FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.***] period
provided for in Section 5.8, CIMA agrees to enter into good faith negotiations
with Alamo to discuss terms of manufacture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement may be terminated as follows:

                  (a) Termination for Insolvency. If either Alamo or CIMA (i)
         makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes
         insolvent; (ii) files an insolvency petition in bankruptcy; (iii)
         petitions for or acquiesces in the appointment of any receiver, trustee
         or similar officer to liquidate or conserve its business or any
         substantial part of its assets; (iv) commences under the laws of any
         jurisdiction any proceeding involving its insolvency, bankruptcy,
         reorganization, adjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or any
         other similar proceeding for the release of financially distressed
         debtors; or (v) becomes a party to any proceeding or action of the type
         described above in (iii) or (iv) and such proceeding or action remains
         undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than 60 days, then the
         other party may by written notice terminate this Agreement in its
         entirety with immediate effect.

                  (b) Termination for Default. In addition to Alamo's rights
         under Section 4.1(c), Alamo and CIMA each shall have the right to
         terminate this Agreement for default upon the other's failure to comply
         in any material respect with the terms and conditions of this
         Agreement. At least 60 days prior to any such termination for default,
         the party seeking to so terminate shall give the other written notice
         of its intention to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 11.1(b), which notice shall set forth the
         default(s) which form the basis for such termination. If the defaulting
         party fails to correct such default(s) within 60 days after receipt of
         notification, then such party immediately may terminate this Agreement.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Alamo fails to pay any invoice for
         development fees payable pursuant to Section 3.2 above with respect to
         one of the development activities set forth on the Development Schedule
         within 45 days after receipt of such invoice following the successful
         completion of such development

                                      -27-
<PAGE>



         activity, CIMA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by
         delivering written notice of such election to terminate and this
         Agreement shall terminate on the thirtieth (30th) day following the
         receipt of such notice by Alamo, unless prior to such thirtieth (30th)
         day Alamo shall have cured such failure to pay or shall have delivered
         to CIMA written notice that it disputes that such development activity
         has been successfully completed. This Section 11.1(b) shall not be
         exclusive and shall not be in lieu of any other remedies available to a
         party hereto for any default hereunder on the part of the other party.

                  (c) Continuing Obligations. Termination of this Agreement
         for any reason shall not relieve the parties of any obligation accruing
         prior thereto with respect to the Product and any ongoing obligations
         hereunder with respect to the remaining Product and shall be without
         prejudice to the rights and remedies of either party with respect to
         any antecedent breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, no termination of this
         Agreement, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, shall serve to
         terminate the obligations of the parties hereto under Sections 9.3,
         9.4, 9.6, 9.8, 10, 11.1(c) and 12 hereof, and such obligations shall
         survive any such termination.

                                   SECTION 12

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither CIMA nor Alamo
may assign any of its rights, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other, except that no prior written consent shall be
required in the event that a third party acquires substantially all of the
assets or outstanding shares of, or merges with, Alamo or CIMA, as the case may
be.

         12.2 Notices. All notices or other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given if delivered by hand or facsimile and confirmed in writing, or
mailed first class, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested (mailed notices and notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed
to have been given on the date received) as follows:

     5) In the definition of "CIMA Technology" replace "DuraSolv(TM)" with
