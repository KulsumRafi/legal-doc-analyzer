Section 5(g) shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Holding Company, which may be the accounting firm then regularly retained by the Holding Company (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;). The Accounting Firm shall provide its
determination (the &#147;Determination&#148;), together with detailed supporting calculations, regarding the amount of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant matter, both to the Holding Company and the Executive, within five (5) days of a date
of termination, if applicable, or such earlier time as is requested by the Holding Company or the Executive (if the Executive reasonably believes that any of the Total Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). Any determination by the Accounting
Firm shall be binding upon the Holding Company and the Executive. As a result of uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, or as a result of a
subsequent determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a judicial authority, it is possible that the Holding Company should have made Gross-Up Payments (&#147;Underpayment&#148;), or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the Holding
Company which should not have been made (&#147;Overpayments&#148;). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred. In the case of the Underpayment, the amount of such

(including the filing of returns and claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures established by, the Holding Company, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Holding Company to correct such Overpayment, including

Certain Accounting Rules. The Executive acknowledges that it is in the Holding Company&#146;s and Bank&#146;s best interests to remain eligible to account for any business combination into which they may become a party under the
&#147;pooling-of-interests&#148; method of accounting. The Holding Company does not believe that any provision of the foregoing Amendment to Employment Agreement will affect the Holding Company&#146;s or Bank&#146;s ability to so account for any
business combination. Due to the uncertainties associated with the accounting rules governing the pooling-of-interests method, however, it is possible that the provisions of this Amendment may impact the Holding Company&#146;s or Bank&#146;s ability
to use pooling-of-interests accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, in the event the Board of Directors determines it to be in the best interests of the Holding Company or Bank to account for a business combination under the
pooling-of-interests method and, in the written opinion of the Accounting Firm referred to above, if any provision of this Amendment makes a business combination to which the Holding Company or Bank is a party ineligible for pooling-of interests
accounting under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 16, as modified or amended, that but for such provision of this Amendment to Employment Agreement would otherwise be eligible for such accounting treatment, then the Holding Company and Executive
agree that the terms of this Amendment shall be rescinded to the extent necessary to enable the business combination to so qualify for such accounting treatment. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
