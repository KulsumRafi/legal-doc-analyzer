Assumed Contracts shall be identified on Schedule 2.1.1.5 by the date of the
Assumed Contract, the other party or parties to the Assumed Contract and the
address of such party or parties, and all such information shall be included on
an exhibit attached to a motion for the authority to assume and assign the
Assumed Contracts which motion shall be filed by the Debtors at the direction of
the Buyer. Such exhibit shall also set forth the amounts necessary to cure
defaults under each of such Assumed Contracts


                                       18
<PAGE>


as determined by the Debtors based on the Debtors' Books and Records. Until the
Solicitation Date, the Buyer, in its sole discretion, by delivery of written
notice to the Debtors, shall have the right to (i) add any Contractual
Obligation to Schedule 2.1.1.5 and/or (ii) exclude any Contractual Obligation
listed on Schedule 2.1.1.5, and the Buyer shall not acquire any rights or assume
any Liabilities with respect to any such excluded Contractual Obligation. The
Plan of Reorganization shall reflect that the applicable Asset Buyer's promise

only adequate assurance of future performance necessary to satisfy the
requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the assignment
to the applicable Asset Buyer of such Assumed Contracts.

     2.6 DEEMED CONSENTS; CURES. For all purposes of this Agreement
(including all representations and warranties of the Debtors contained herein),

that, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization or other Bankruptcy Court order,
the Debtors are authorized to assume and assign Assumed Contracts to the Asset
Buyer(s) pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable Cure
Amount has been satisfied. If there exists on the Closing Date any default
related to an Assumed Contract which relates to the Acquired Product Lines, the
Buyer shall be responsible for Cure Amounts only to the extent such Cure Amounts
are set forth on Schedule 2.1.1.5 as of the Solicitation Date as a condition to
the assumption and assignment of such Assumed Contract. At the Closing, the
Buyer shall provide funds to the Debtors (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) in an amount sufficient to pay all such Cure Amounts not to
exceed the aggregate amount of the Cure Amounts set forth on Schedule 2.1.1.5 as
of the Solicitation Date for such Assumed Contracts. Immediately upon receipt by
the Debtors of such funds, the Debtors shall pay all Cure Amounts for such
Assumed Contracts.

     3.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The aggregate consideration (the "PURCHASE PRICE")
to be paid for the Acquired Assets shall be an amount equal to the sum of (i)
cash in the amount of (a) $12,950,000 plus (b) the balance, as of the Closing,
of the principal amount due under the DIP Loan Agreement, taking into account
all payments made in respect of such principal amount by the Debtors through the
Closing (collectively the "CASH PURCHASE PRICE") plus (ii) the Additional
Consideration (which amount, if requested in writing by the Debtors at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing, shall be secured by a Letter of Credit
to be delivered by the Buyer at the Closing). Allowed Administrative Claims (as
defined in the Plan of Reorganization) shall be treated in accordance with the
terms of the Plan of Reorganization.

     3.2 PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT AND PURCHASE PRICE.

         3.2.1 The Buyer will deposit the Deposit with the Debtors in accordance
with the terms of the Earnest Money Deposit Agreement. The Parties hereby agree
that it is impossible to determine accurately the amount of damages that the
Debtors would suffer if the transactions contemplated hereby were not
consummated as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Buyer. As a result,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the Buyer materially
breaches its obligations under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured

                                       19
<PAGE>


within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by the Buyer from the Debtors of
written notice of such breach); and (ii) the Debtors terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 9.1.4, the Buyer shall be obligated to pay liquidated
damages in the amount of the Deposit in accordance with the terms of the Earnest
Money Deposit Agreement, and the receipt by the Debtors of the Deposit shall be
the Debtors' sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages. Accordingly, if
liquidated damages are payable hereunder in accordance with the foregoing, the
Deposit (together with all interest accrued thereon) shall be released to the
Debtors in accordance with the terms of the Earnest Money Deposit Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than under the foregoing
circumstances, the Debtors shall upon such termination return to the Buyer the
Deposit together with all interest accrued thereon in accordance with the terms
of the Earnest Money Deposit Agreement, and neither the Buyer nor the Asset
Buyer(s) shall have any further obligation of any kind to any of the Debtors.
Upon the consummation of the Closing hereunder, the Deposit (together with all
interest accrued thereon) shall be applied by the Debtors against the Cash
Purchase Price as set forth in Section 3.2.2 below.

         3.2.2 At the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Asset Buyer(s) to pay
by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount in cash equal to the
Cash Purchase Price less the amount of the Deposit (together with all interest
accrued thereon). Such payment shall be made to the Debtors to such account as
designated by the Debtors in writing to the Buyer, in accordance with the terms
of the Plan of Reorganization, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. No later than six (6) months following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall deliver the Additional Consideration to such Person(s) as designated by
the Debtors in writing to the Buyer no later than January 22, 2003; provided
that if no such designation is made on or prior to January 22, 2003, the
Additional Consideration shall be delivered to the Debtors. If requested in
writing by the Debtors no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Debtors a Letter of Credit in an amount
equal to the Additional Consideration.

     3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Buyer and the Debtors shall allocate
the Purchase Price (plus the Assumed Obligations) among the Acquired Assets as
set forth on Schedule 3.3 attached hereto (which schedule shall be agreed to by
the Parties no later than thirty (30) Business Days after to the Closing), and
such Schedule shall be used by the parties in preparing (i) Form 8594, Asset
Acquisition Statement, for the Buyer and the Debtors and (ii) all Tax Returns.
The Buyer and the Debtors shall each file Form 8594 prepared in accordance with
this Section 3.3 with its federal income Tax Return for its tax period which
includes the Closing Date. All allocations made pursuant to this Section 3.3
shall be binding upon the parties and upon each of their successors and assigns,
and the Parties shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with such allocations.

withheld) prior to the date hereof have been paid (or withheld). Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.17, no ongoing audit, litigation or similar proceeding
concerning any Tax returns of any Debtor has been proposed, threatened, or is in
progress nor does there exist any waiver or agreement for the extension of time
for the assessment of any Taxes against any Debtor. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.17, there are no Liens on any of the assets of the Debtors that arose
in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax and there are
no claims for Taxes, and to Debtors' knowledge, no basis for which any such
claims might be made, that might result in any such Liens. Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.17, no claim has ever been made by a taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where the Debtors do not currently file Tax returns that any Debtor
is or may be subject to taxation by such jurisdiction. None of the Acquired
Assets is a "tax exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of
the Code. None of the Acquired Assets is subject to a lease made pursuant to
Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

     5.18 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. The Accounts Receivable constitute bona fide,
valid and collectible claims arising in the Ordinary Course of Business in a
manner consistent with the Debtors' normal credit practices and are subject to
no set-offs or counterclaims, subject only to reasonable reserves for bad debts
calculated in a manner consistent with the Debtors' past practice.

     5.19 BROKERS; AGENTS. Except with respect to Jefferies & Company, Inc., the
Debtors have not dealt with any agent, finder, broker or other representative in
any manner which could result in the Buyer or the Asset Buyer(s) being liable
for any fee or commission in the nature of a finder's fee or originator's fee in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement.

     5.20 WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS. Schedule 5.20 contains a true and complete
description of the Debtors' experience over the past three years with respect to
product warranty obligations, pricing and other accommodations with respect to
the Acquired Product Lines. To the best of Debtors' knowledge, as of November 1,
2002, sufficient reserves were maintained on the books of the Debtors to cover
the Debtors' product warranty obligations. Over the past three years, the
Debtors have had no product recall obligations.

     5.21 REAL PROPERTY. Attached hereto as Schedule 5.21 is a description of
all Assumed Owned Real Property and the Assumed Facilities. True and complete
copies of all owners policies of title insurance obtained for the benefit of any
of the Debtors have been delivered to the Buyer. The Debtors own good and
marketable fee title to the Assumed Owned Real Property. At the Closing, such
title shall be free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Except as
set forth in Schedule 5.21, the Assumed Owned Real Property and the Assumed
Facilities constitute all of the real property used by any of the Debtors in
connection with the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Product Lines. Each parcel
included in the Assumed Owned Real Property constitutes a separate tax lot.
There is no pending or, to the Debtors'


                                       32
<PAGE>


knowledge, threatened condemnation (or sale in lieu thereof) affecting the
Assumed Owned Real Property.

     5.22 LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.22 or claims made in
connection with the Reorganization Cases, there are no actions, claims, charges,
complaints, material grievances, causes of action, proceedings, suits or
investigations pending or, to the Debtors' knowledge, threatened, against the
Debtors or any of their respective assets, properties or rights, before (or that
could come before) any Governmental Authority or arbitrator that would result in
a Material Adverse Change. Except in connection with the Reorganization Cases,
none of Debtors is subject to any Order entered in any lawsuit or proceeding.

     5.23 TRADE RELATIONS. On or prior to the date hereof, the Debtors have
delivered to the Buyer a list of each of the Debtors' ten largest customers (the
"MATERIAL CUSTOMERS") and ten largest suppliers (the "MATERIAL SUPPLIERS"), as
determined by the dollar amount of sales to such customers and purchases from
such suppliers for the year ending December 31, 2001. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.23, there exists no actual or, to the Debtors' knowledge, threatened,
cancellation of, or (except for the tightening of credit terms as a result of
Reorganization Cases) any material adverse modification to or change in, the
business relationship of the Debtors with any Material Customer or Material
Supplier.

     5.24 SUBSIDIARIES. Schedule 5.24 sets forth the name and jurisdiction of
incorporation of each Subsidiary of the Debtors, the number of shares of each
class of each of the Debtors' Subsidiary's Stock (both authorized, issued and
outstanding), the names of the holders of each such issued share of Stock and
the number of shares held by each such holder, the number of shares of each such
Subsidiary's Stock held in treasury and each Subsidiary's directors and

employed in connection with the Acquired Product Lines shall be terminated by
the Debtors, and all employees set forth on Schedule 7.5.1 shall have the right

specifically assumed under Section 2.2 hereof, the Debtors shall be responsible
for any and all wages, bonuses, commissions, employee benefits, retention or
stay bonus arrangements, and other compensation (including all obligations under

         7.5.2 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any
employee of the Debtors hired by the Buyer and/or any Asset Buyer (the "REHIRED
EMPLOYEES") any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Buyer,
nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of the Buyer and/or the Asset
Buyer(s) to terminate the employment of any Rehired Employees at any time, with
or without notice, or restrict the Buyer and/or the Asset Buyer(s), in the
exercise of their business judgment in modifying any of the terms or conditions
of employment of the Rehired Employees after the Closing.

authorizations and releases from such employees) who are being considered for
employment by the Buyer and/or the Asset Buyer(s), (iii) to distribute to such
employees of the Debtors such forms and other documents relating to potential
employment by the Buyer and/or the Asset Buyer(s) after the Closing as the Buyer

respect of notices and payments relating to events occurring after the Closing,

<PAGE>


Governmental Authority, pursuant to any applicable Law, including but not
limited to the WARN Act, with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of

     7.8 BANKRUPTCY ACTIONS. The Debtors will provide the Buyer with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon all motions, applications and
supporting papers prepared by the Debtors relating to this Agreement (including
forms of Orders and notices to interested parties) prior to the filing thereof

prepared by the Debtors and relating to the approval of this Agreement
(including forms of Orders and notices to interested parties) to be filed on
behalf of the Debtors after the date hereof must be acceptable in form and
substance to Buyer, in its reasonable discretion.

     7.9 EXCLUDED REAL PROPERTY. The Debtors agree that the covenants contained

who are or were employed in connection with the Acquired Product Lines arising

disability programs), the Debtors shall, at their own expense, honor or cause
their respective insurance carriers to honor such claims, whether made before or
after the Closing, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Employee
Benefit Plans without regard to the employment by the Buyer or the Asset
Buyer(s) of any such employees after the Closing and without regard to the
assumption by the Buyer or the Asset Buyer(s) of the Assumed Plans.

         8.1.2 As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall cause each Rehired Employee to be given credit for his or her service with

of determining such Rehired Employee's vacation and sick leave (on a
going-forward basis) in any vacation or sick leave plan, program or arrangement
maintained for the Buyer's employees' benefit on or after the Closing Date;
provided, however, neither the Buyer nor the Asset Buyer(s) shall be obligated
to pay any cash amounts based on such credit. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
Buyer and the Asset Buyer(s) shall be responsible only for accrued liabilities
and claims with respect to vacation and sick leave earned or accrued by Rehired
Employees on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent such Liability is
specifically assumed under Section 2.2.1 hereof.

     8.2 COOPERATION OF THE BUYER AND THE DEBTORS. The Buyer and the Debtors
jointly covenant and agree that, from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer and
the Debtors will each use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with each
other in connection with any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or audit of
the other relating to (a) the preparation of an audit of any Tax Return of any
Debtor or the Buyer for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and
(b) any audit of the Buyer or any Asset Buyer and/or any audit of any Debtor
with respect to the sales, transfer and similar Taxes imposed by the laws of any
state or political subdivision thereof, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance hereof, the Buyer and the Debtors
further covenant and agree to promptly respond to all reasonable inquiries
related to such matters and to provide, to the extent reasonably possible,
substantiation of transactions and to make available and furnish appropriate
documents and personnel in connection therewith. All costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Section 8.2 referred to herein shall be borne by the
party who is subject to such action.

     8.3 FURTHER ASSURANCES; CERTAIN CONSENTS. From time to time after the
Closing and without further consideration, (i) the Debtors, upon the request of
the Buyer, shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments of
conveyance and transfer as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to
consummate more effectively the purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets as
contemplated hereby and to vest in the Asset Buyer title to the Acquired Assets
transferred hereunder, and (ii) the Buyer, upon the request of the Debtors,
shall execute and deliver (or shall cause to be executed and delivered) such
documents and instruments of contract or lease assumption as Debtors may
reasonably request in order to confirm the Asset Buyer(s)' liability for the
obligations specifically assumed hereunder or otherwise more fully consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, if a consent of a Third Party which is required in order to
assign any Acquired


                                       41
<PAGE>


Asset (or Claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom) is
not obtained prior to the Closing, or if an attempted assignment would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the ability of any Debtor to convey its
interest in question to the applicable Asset Buyer, the Debtors will cooperate
with the Buyer and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in any lawful arrangement
to provide that the applicable Asset Buyer shall receive the interests of any
Debtor in the benefits of such Acquired Asset. If any consent or waiver is not
obtained before the Closing and the Closing is nevertheless consummated, each
Debtor agrees to continue to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all
such consents as have not been obtained prior to such date.

     8.4 NAME CHANGES. Promptly after the Closing, each Debtor shall and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to take all necessary action to change its name
to a name bearing no resemblance to the names set forth on the signature pages
to this Agreement and following the Closing each Debtor shall not and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to use, directly or indirectly, the name "Diamond" or
"Forster" or any other name which is confusingly similar thereto.

     8.5 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE/COLLECTIONS. After the Closing, the Debtors shall
permit the applicable Asset Buyer to collect, in the name of the Debtors, all
Accounts Receivable constituting part of the Acquired Assets and to endorse with
the name of any Debtor for deposit in the applicable Asset Buyer's account any
checks or drafts received in payment thereof. Debtors shall promptly deliver to
the applicable Asset Buyer any cash, checks or other property that they may
receive after the Closing in respect of any Accounts Receivable or other asset
constituting part of the Acquired Assets.

     8.6 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. For a period of twenty-four (24) months after
the Closing Date (the "TRANSITION Period"), each Party and their representatives
shall have reasonable access to, and each shall have the right to photocopy, all
of the Books and Records relating to the Acquired Product Lines or the Acquired
Assets, including all employee records or other personnel and medical records
required by law, legal process or subpoena, in the possession of the other party
to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by such Party in
connection with the Assumed Obligations or the Unassumed Liabilities, or other
matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Acquired Product Lines
and the Acquired Assets. During the Transition Period, and only to the extent
that the Buyer's operation of the Acquired Assets is not interrupted in any
material respect, the Buyer agrees to provide the Debtors, during ordinary
business hours and upon reasonable notice and at any Debtor's request, with
reasonable access to employees of the Buyer and/or the Asset Buyer(s) for
purposes of winding down the estates of the Debtors. Such access shall be
afforded by the party in possession of such Books and Records upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours; provided, however,
that (A) any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of any party or its
affiliates, (B) no party shall be required to take any action which would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and (C) no party need
supply the other party with any information which such party is under a legal
obligation not to supply. The party exercising this right of access shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
Section 8.6. If the party in possession of such Books and Records shall desire
to dispose of any such Books and Records upon or prior to the expiration of such
period, such party shall, prior to such disposition, give the


                                       42
<PAGE>


other party a reasonable opportunity at such other party's expense, to segregate
and remove such Books and Records as such other party may select.

     8.7 TRANSITION SERVICES. Following the Closing, the Debtors shall provide
to the Asset Buyer(s) and the Buyer various services, including without
limitation, operations support services (e.g., storage space for the Acquired
Assets) and other transition services pursuant to mutually acceptable terms and
conditions.

                                   TERMINATION

     9.1 TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. This Agreement may be terminated and
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

         9.1.1 by mutual written consent of the Parties;

         9.1.2 by the Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before
February 7, 2003; provided that if the Buyer is in breach of its obligations
under this Agreement, the Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1.2 if its breach is a primary cause of the delay of the Closing;

         9.1.3 by the Buyer, so long as the Buyer is not then in breach of its
obligations hereunder, if there has been a material breach of a Debtor's
Representation as of the date of this Agreement or at the time of termination as
if made on the date of such termination, except to the extent it relates to a
particular date, or if there has been a material breach by the Debtors of their
obligations under this Agreement, and in either case which breach, if curable,
has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by the
Debtors of written notice of such breach and is existing at the time of
termination of this Agreement;

         9.1.4 by the Debtors, so long as none of the Debtors is then in breach
of its obligations hereunder, if there has been a material breach of a Buyer's
Representation as of the date of this Agreement or at the time of termination as
if made on the date of such termination, except to the extent it relates to a
particular date, or if there has been a material breach by the Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement, and in either case which breach, if curable,
has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by the Buyer
of written notice of such breach and is existing at the time of termination of
this Agreement; and

         9.1.5 by the Buyer or the Debtors, if any event occurs which renders
satisfaction of one or more of its conditions to effect the Closing impossible;
provided that the Buyer or the Debtors, as the case may be, shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1.5 if the
impossibility results primarily from such party itself breaching any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

     9.2 NOTICE OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either the Buyer or the Debtors in accordance with Section 9.1, the
terminating Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
non-terminating Party.

     9.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Except as specifically provided in Section
3.2.1, in the event of the termination or abandonment of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of


                                       43
<PAGE>


Section 9.1, the Deposit will be returned to the Buyer in accordance with the
Earnest Money Deposit Agreement, and this Agreement thereafter shall become null
and void and cease to have any effect other than the provisions of Sections
5.19, 6.5, 10.9 and 10.22, which sections shall survive such termination.

     9.4 NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties of the Debtors and the Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered in connection herewith shall not survive the Closing.

                                   ARTICLE X
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     10.1 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. No amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent
to any departure therefrom, will in any event be effective unless the same is in
writing and is signed by Buyer and the Debtors. Any waiver of any provision of
this Agreement and any consent to any departure from the terms of any provision
of this Agreement is to be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given.

     10.2 ASSIGNMENTS. No Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by
operation of Law (including a merger or consolidation), judicial decree or
otherwise) to any other Person without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to (i) any Affiliate of the Buyer and (ii) as
collateral for indebtedness for borrowed money, the Acquired Product Lines or
the Acquired Assets without the consent of the Debtors, but no such assignment
shall relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

     10.3 BUSINESS DAY. If any day on which any payment is required to be made
hereunder, or on which any notice must be sent, or on which any time period
described herein commences or ends is not a Business Day, then such day will be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to fall on the next succeeding day
which is a Business Day.

     10.4 CAPTIONS. Captions contained in this Agreement and the table of
contents preceding this Agreement have been inserted herein only as a matter of
convenience and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this
Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

     10.5 COUNTERPART FACSIMILE EXECUTION. For purposes of this Agreement, a
document (or signature page thereto) signed and transmitted by facsimile machine
or telecopier is to be treated as an original document. The signature of any
Party thereon, for purposes hereof, is to be considered as an original
signature, and the document transmitted is to be considered to have the same
binding effect as an original signature on an original document. At the request
of any Party, any facsimile or telecopy document is to be re-executed in
original form by the Parties who executed the facsimile or telecopy document. No
Party may raise the use of a facsimile machine


                                       44
<PAGE>


or telecopier or the fact that any signature was transmitted through the use of
a facsimile or telecopier machine as a defense to the enforcement of this
Agreement or any amendment or other document executed in compliance with this
Section.

     10.6 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties on any
number of separate counterparts, and all such counterparts so executed
constitute one agreement binding on all the Parties notwithstanding that all the
Parties are not signatories to the same counterpart.

     10.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the Plan of
Reorganization, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, letters of intent,
understandings, negotiations and discussions of the Parties, whether oral or
written. If there are any inconsistencies between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, the Parties and the Creditors'
Committee hereby agree to work in good faith to resolve any such
inconsistencies.

     10.8 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS. All of the Schedules and Exhibits attached to
this Agreement are deemed incorporated herein by reference.

     10.9 EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PARTIES. Except as otherwise provided herein,
in the Plan of Reorganization or agreed to in writing by the Parties, all legal
and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are to be paid by the Party incurring such
costs and expenses.

     10.10 FAILURE OR DELAY. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right, power or privilege hereunder operates as
a waiver thereof; nor does any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No notice to or demand on any
Party in any case entitles such Party to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances.

     10.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable Delaware principles of conflicts of law)
as to all matters, including but not limited to matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

     10.12 LEGAL FEES. In the event any Party brings suit or institutes
arbitration proceedings to construe or enforce the terms hereof, or raises this
Agreement as a defense in a suit or arbitration proceeding brought by another
Party, the prevailing Party in such suit or arbitration proceeding shall be
entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and expenses. The Debtors agree to pay
directly all Taxes, fees and other charges, including all sales Taxes, transfer
Taxes and recording charges, incurred as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Debtors will seek a provision
in the Confirmation Order that exempts the transactions contemplated hereby from
Taxes pursuant to ss.1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

advertisement, filing, public statement or announcement made by or at the

<PAGE>

Reasonable Efforts to consult with the other Party before making any such
release, public statement or announcement.

     10.15 REMEDIES ARE EXCLUSIVE. Except in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct, the remedies provided herein are the sole remedies of the Parties
and are exclusive of any remedies or rights that might be available to any Party
at law, in equity or otherwise.

     10.16 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited,
unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction is, as to such jurisdiction,
ineffective to the extent of any such prohibition, unenforceability or
nonauthorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, or
affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any
other jurisdiction, unless the ineffectiveness of such provision would result in
such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be unreasonable. Upon a determination that any provision of this
Agreement is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized, the Parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner,
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     10.17 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Each Party recognizes
that, if it fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations under
this Agreement, no remedy at law will provide adequate relief to the other
Party. Therefore, each Party is hereby authorized to demand specific performance
of this Agreement, and is entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief,
in a court of competent jurisdiction at any time when the other Party fails to
comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to it. To the
extent permitted by Law, each Party hereby irrevocably waives any defense that
it might have based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which might be asserted
as a bar to such remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief.

     10.18 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE
BANKRUPTCY COURT AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
HEREBY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE
GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED
HEREIN, SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING.


                                       47
<PAGE>

     10.19 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All provisions of this Agreement are binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and are enforceable by or against the Parties and
their respective heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives
and permitted successors and assigns.

     10.20 THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and no other
Person has any right, benefit, priority or interest under or because of the
existence of this Agreement except as specifically set forth herein.

     10.21 EFFECTIVE CONTROL. If the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time) are consummated and the Plan of Reorganization (as may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time) is confirmed in accordance

acquired effective control (i.e., the risks and rewards of ownership) of the
Acquired Product Lines shall be January 1, 2003.

     10.22 LIABILITY OF BUYER'S AFFILIATES. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, member, shareholder, incorporator, partner or Affiliate of
