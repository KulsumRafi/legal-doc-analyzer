2.       RIGHT OF FIRST OPPORTUNITY.

         During the ROFO Period, Sunrise shall not Transfer or enter into any
agreement to Transfer, and shall not permit any of its Related Parties to
Transfer or enter into any agreement to Transfer, any Sunrise Development
Property (or any direct or indirect beneficial interest therein [excluding sales
of shares in SALI so long as same is publicly traded on a nationally recognized
exchange]) unless Sunrise shall have provided an opportunity (a "Right of First
Opportunity") to AEW to acquire and develop the Sunrise Development Property as
herein provided. Sunrise is under no obligation to Transfer any Sunrise
Development Property to any Third Party or to AEW, and may develop properties
for its own account if Sunrise so desires (it being expressly agreed, however,
that development of a Sunrise Development Property for Sunrise's "own account"
shall be deemed to mean that the Sunrise Development Property is owned by SALI
or SALII or by an Entity in which SALI or SALII owns all of the ownership
interests). If Sunrise (or its Related Parties) desires to Transfer a Sunrise
Development Property, however, then it shall do so upon the following terms and
conditions:

                  (a)      Before Sunrise Transfers any Sunrise Development
Property during the ROFO Period, Sunrise shall give a Notice of Opportunity to
AEW which shall (i) describe the Sunrise Development Property; (ii) set forth
costs incurred to date in connection with the acquisition, development,
construction and lease-up of the Sunrise Development Property; (iii) set forth a
development budget in form and scope consistent with the "Development Budgets"
used in the AL U.S. Development Venture Agreement (a "Proposed Development
Budget"); (iv) estimate the projected net operating income for the applicable
Sunrise Development Property upon Stabilization thereof; (v) attach a summary of
the Preliminary Information concerning the applicable Sunrise Development
Property in Sunrise's possession or control; and (vi) set forth the terms and
conditions under which Sunrise would be willing to accept investment by a Third
Party in such Sunrise Development Property (the "ROFO Terms and Conditions").
AEW shall have twenty-one (21) days after delivery of the Notice of Opportunity
(the "ROFO Review Period") to review the information (complete copies of which
shall be made available at Sunrise's main office) and to accept the Right of
First Opportunity upon the ROFO Terms and Conditions by notice given to Sunrise
within the ROFO Review Period.

                  (b)      If AEW elects to accept any Right of First
Opportunity by notice given to Sunrise within the applicable ROFO Review Period,
then, within 90 days after the date of notice of such acceptance from the AEW
Member (the date of any such notice of acceptance being referred to as a "ROFO
Acceptance Date"), Sunrise shall Transfer the Sunrise Development Property upon
the ROFO Terms and Conditions to AEW or a joint venture with AEW or its investor
clients, as the case may be, subject to the provisions of Section 2(d) below.

                  (c)      If AEW fails to give notice of its acceptance of any
Right of First Opportunity to Sunrise prior to the expiration of any applicable
ROFO Review Period, then AEW shall be deemed to have waived its Right of First
Opportunity with respect to the Sunrise Development Property, subject to the
provisions of Section 2(d) below.



                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                  (d)      If:

                  (i)      AEW accepts any Right of First Opportunity but the
                           parties are not negotiating in good faith to enter
                           into mutually satisfactory documents effectuating the
                           Transfer ("Transfer Documents") as of the date which
                           is thirty (30) days after the Acceptance Date; or

                  (ii)     AEW accepts any Right of First Opportunity but the
                           parties fail to enter into the Transfer Documents
                           within ninety (90) days after the Acceptance Date; or

                  (iii)    AEW waives or is deemed to have waived any Right of
                           First Opportunity with respect to any Sunrise
                           Development Property pursuant to Section 1(c) above;

then, in any such case, Sunrise shall have the right to Transfer the applicable
Sunrise Development Property to any Third Party at any time without regard to
the provisions of Section 2(a) above, and AEW shall have no further obligations
with respect thereto; provided, however, that, if, after the expiration of the
thirty (30) day period under clause (i) above, the expiration of the ninety (90)
day period under clause (ii) above or the date of waiver or deemed waiver of any
Right of First Opportunity under clause (iii) above, as the case may be, Sunrise
receives any offer from any Third Party which it desires to accept, or makes an
offer to any Third Party, with respect to the Transfer of such Sunrise
Development Property upon terms and conditions that are materially more
favorable to the proposed transferee than the ROFO Terms and Conditions, then
Sunrise shall not Transfer the Sunrise Development Property without again
offering to Transfer the Sunrise Development Property to AEW in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2(a) above (notwithstanding whether the ROFO Period
has expired), except that the ROFO Terms and Conditions shall be the revised to
match the terms and conditions offered to (or by) the Third Party (it being
understood and agreed that the provisions of this Section 2(d) shall also apply
with respect to each such subsequent opportunity notwithstanding whether the
ROFO Period has expired).

                  (e)      All Pursuit Costs incurred by AEW with respect to any
Sunrise Development Property for which a Notice of Opportunity is given by
Sunrise shall be paid by AEW, unless AEW shall exercise its right to purchase
and develop same as set forth herein and actually closes thereon, in which case
such Pursuit Costs shall be joint venture expenses.

                  (f)      Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision
thereof to the contrary, if AEW shall waive or be deemed to have waived its
Right of First Opportunity with respect to four (4) or more Qualified Sunrise
Development Properties under Section 2(c) above, then Sunrise shall thereafter
have no further obligation to present any Right of First Opportunity to AEW with
respect to any Sunrise Development Property.

                  (g)      The rights of AEW under this Section shall be subject
to the prior rights granted to third parties set forth on Exhibit C attached
hereto and incorporated herein. Sunrise hereby agrees that it shall not modify,
amend or extend any of such prior rights without the prior written consent of
AEW, which may be given or withheld in its sole discretion.

ANY OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RIGHTS
OR OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. The titles of the Articles and Sections
in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered in
construing this Agreement. Pronouns used herein shall be construed to refer to
the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural as the identity of the
individual or entity referred to may require. No provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted as bestowing any rights whatsoever upon any third party
other than the Subsidiaries. A cross-reference to another section shall be
deemed to be to such section of this Agreement, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.

         8.4.     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.


         8.5.     ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any party seeks to enforce such party's
rights under this Agreement by legal proceedings or otherwise the non-prevailing
party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses in connection therewith,
including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and witness fees. In
this Section, "non-prevailing party" shall not be meant to refer to a party who
initiates or accepts a settlement offer with regards to such legal proceeding.

         8.6.     SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined
to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if
possible, to achieve the intent of the parties. In any event, all other
provisions shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the greatest possible
extent.

         8.7.     BINDING ON SUCCESSORS. The rights and obligations of the
parties under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind their

confidentiality of the financial terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
maintain the confidentiality of (a) any financial information provided by one
party to the other, and (b) all information contained in any plans,
specifications, manuals, forms, contracts, books, records, computer discs and
similar materials containing information, invoices and other documents received
or maintained by the AEW Member pursuant to this Agreement, other than
information that is available from public sources. Either party may, however,
disclose any of such information to its agents, directors, officers, employees,
advisors, attorneys, affiliates or representatives who require such information
for the purpose of performing or assisting in the performance of its obligations
or services hereunder, and to investors or lenders or proposed investors or
lenders, provided that in all such cases such parties shall be informed of the
confidential nature of such information. Either party hereto may also disclose
any such information (x) to the extent required by law, regulation (including
SEC regulations) or court order provided that such party shall have first, to
the extent reasonably practicable, advised the other of the requirement to
disclose such information and shall have afforded the other an opportunity to
dispute such requirement and seek relief therefrom by legal process, (y) in
connection with any suit, action, arbitration or other proceedings between the
parties hereto or their respective Related Parties, or (z) to the extent
required in connection with the preparation or filing of any tax returns or
other filings required by any applicable law. Any press releases or other public
announcements concerning the AEW Member, the Venture or the arrangement between
the parties shall be mutually approved by both parties in their reasonable
discretion.

         "As used herein, the term "Selection Criteria #1" shall mean that
Qualified Care Giver demand divided by the number of Qualified units in the
primary market area is greater than 14. A Sunrise Development Property is a

is greater than 18. Qualified Care Giver is based on the number of residents who
are age 45-64 age head of household with income greater than $75,000 in the
Primary Market Area. Qualified Senior is based on the number of residents who
are 75 Plus age head of household with income greater than $25,000 in the
Primary Market Area. Qualified Units are based on those units that are either
opened or in construction and are categorized as a 2B, 2AC, 3B, or 3C utilizing
