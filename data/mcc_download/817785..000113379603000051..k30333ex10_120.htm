pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Warrant Holder has agreed to loan
to the Company $200,000 Dollars (the &#147;Loan Amount&#148;), subject to the
issuance by the Company of a convertible secured promissory note (the
&#147;Note&#148;), and the Company has agreed to issue to the Warrant Holder
warrants (the &#147;Warrants&#148;) to purchase [_________] shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock, par value $.0025 per share (the &#147;Common
Stock&#148;), which equals the Loan Amount divided by eighty (80%) percent of
the Exercise Price (as defined in Section 1 hereof), subject to the terms set
forth herein.</font></td></tr></table>

<p><table width=600><tr><td><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
promises contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:</font></td></tr></table>

<p><table width=600><tr><td><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Warrants</U>. The Company hereby grants to the Warrant Holder, subject to the terms
set forth herein, the right to purchase from the Company at any time and from
time to time after the date hereof until 5:00 p.m., New York City local time, on
November 12, 2012 (the &#147;Expiration Date&#148;), up to [_________] fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 3 hereof (the &#147;Shares&#148;), which number of Shares equals the
Loan Amount divided by eighty (80%) percent of the Exercise Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrants shall only be exercisable to the
extent that shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants, when
aggregated with (i) the Company&#146;s outstanding shares of Common Stock as of
the date hereof and (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion or
exercise, as the case may be, of notes, warrants and stock options outstanding
as of the date hereof, would not exceed the number of shares authorized under
the Company&#146;s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. The
Company shall promptly cause its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, to be further amended to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
authorized thereunder as shall be sufficient for reserving and making available
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of the Warrants issued
to the Warrant holder hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, the
&#147;Exercise Price&#148; shall initially be $[_____], which is equal to the
average of the closing bid prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date hereof, subject to any
adjustments pursuant to Section 3 hereof.</FONT></td></tr></table>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exercise</U>. The Warrants may be exercised by the Warrant Holder, in whole or in part, by
delivering the Notice of Exercise purchase form, attached as Exhibit A hereto, duly
executed by the Warrant Holder to the Company at its principal office, or at such other
office as the Company may designate, accompanied by payment, in cash or by wire transfer
or check payable to the order of the Company, of the amount obtained by multiplying the
number of Shares designated in the Notice of Exercise by the Exercise Price (the
&#147;Purchase Price&#148;). The Purchase Price may also be paid, in whole or in part,
by delivery of such purchase form and of shares of Common Stock owned by the Warrant
Holder having a Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof) on the last
trading day ending the day immediately preceding the Exercise Date (as defined below)
equal to the portion of the Purchase Price being paid in such shares. In addition, the
Warrants may be exercised, pursuant to a cashless exercise, except as set forth in
Section 3.3(4) below, by providing irrevocable instructions to the Company, through
delivery of the aforesaid purchase form with an appropriate reference to this Section
2.1 to issue the number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the
number of shares as to which the Warrants are being exercised multiplied by (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Fair Market Value of a share of the Common Stock
on the last business day preceding the Exercise Date less the Exercise Price therefore
and the denominator of which is such Fair Market Value. For purposes hereof,
&#147;Exercise Date&#148; shall mean the date on which all deliveries required to be
made to the Company upon exercise of Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall have
been made.</FONT></td></tr></table>

whole or in part) in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof, the Company, at its expense,
shall cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Warrant Holder (i) a
certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and non-assessable Shares to
which the Warrant Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise and (if applicable) (ii) a
new warrant agreement of like tenor to purchase all of the Shares that may be purchased
pursuant to the portion, if any, of the Warrants not exercised by the Warrant Holder.
The Warrant Holder shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record
of such Shares on the date on which the Notice of Exercise and payment of the Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof were delivered and made, respectively,
irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate or certificates, except that if
the date of such delivery, notice and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of
the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of record
of such Shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock
transfer books are open.</FONT></td></tr></table>
