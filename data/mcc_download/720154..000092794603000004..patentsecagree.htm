The Patents are subsisting and have not been adjudged invalid or  unenforceable,
in whole or in part;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;
To  the  best  of  Borrower's  knowledge,  each  of the  Patents  is  valid  and
enforceable;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Except as  otherwise  disclosed  to Bank in  writing,  Borrower  is the sole and

to each of the Patents,  free and clear of any liens,  charges and encumbrances,

covenants by Borrower not to sue third persons; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Borrower has the  unqualified  right to enter into this  Security  Agreement and

each of its  present and future  employees,  agents and  consultants  which will
enable it to comply with the covenants herein contained.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Dispositions</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower   agrees   that,   until   all  of  the
Obligations  shall  have been  satisfied  in full,  it will not sell,  assign or
otherwise  encumber the Patent  Collateral  without the prior written consent of
the Bank;  provided  however,  that  nothing  contained  herein  shall  prohibit
Borrower from granting  licenses under the Patents in the ordinary course of its
business. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Additional Patent Collateral</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, before the Obligations shall
have been fully, finally and irrevocably paid in full and all of the commitments
of Bank  shall  have  been  terminated,  Borrower  shall  obtain  rights  to any
patentable  invention,   or  become  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  any  patent
application  or  patent  for  any  reissue,  division,  continuation,   renewal,
extension  or  continuation-in-part  of any  patent  or any  improvement  of any
patent,  the provisions of this Security  Agreement  shall  automatically  apply
thereto, and Borrower shall give to Bank prompt written notice thereof. Borrower
agrees  to  enter  into  modifications  to  this  Security  Agreement  to  amend
<U>Schedule  1</U> to include any future Patent  Collateral under this Section 5
for the purpose of recording  Bank&#146;s  security interest under this Security
Agreement against such Patent Collateral. Borrower shall prosecute diligently in
a manner consistent with sound commercial  practices any patent applications and
shall take all  necessary  action to  maintain  and  preserve  all rights in the
Patent Collateral. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Rights and Remedies</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Default under the Credit Agreement shall have
occurred and be continuing, Bank shall have, in addition to all other rights and
remedies  given it by this  Security  Agreement,  those  allowed  by law and the
rights and  remedies of a secured  party under the  Uniform  Commercial  Code as
enacted in any  jurisdiction in which the Patent  Collateral may be located and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Bank may immediately,  without
demand of performance  and without other notice (except as set forth next below)
or demand whatsoever to Borrower,  all of which are hereby expressly waived, and
without advertisement, sell at public or private sale or otherwise realize upon,
in Indianapolis,  Indiana, or elsewhere, the whole or from time to time any part
of the Patent  Collateral,  or any interest which the Borrower may have therein,
and after deducting from the proceeds of sale or other disposition of the Patent
all expenses (including all reasonable expenses for brokers&#146; fees and legal
services),  shall apply the residue of such  proceeds  toward the payment of the
Obligations.  Any  remainder  of the  proceeds  after  payment  in  full  of the
Obligations  shall be paid  over to the  Borrower.  Notice  of any sale or other
disposition  of the Patent  Collateral  shall be given to  Borrower at least ten
(10)  days  before  the time of any  intended  public or  private  sale or other
disposition of the Patent Collateral is to be made, which Borrower hereby agrees
shall be reasonable notice of such sale or other  disposition.  At any such sale
or  other  disposition,  any  holder  of any  note or Bank  may,  to the  extent
permissible  under applicable law,  purchase the whole or any part of the Patent
Collateral  sold,  free from any right of  redemption  on the part of  Borrower,
which right is hereby waived and released. </FONT></P>

<U>Power of Attorney</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers Bank, upon the
occurrence and during the  continuance of a Default under the Credit  Agreement,
to make,  constitute and appoint any officer or agent of Bank as Borrower&#146;s
true and lawful attorney-in-fact,  with power to endorse Borrower&#146;s name on
all  applications  and  other  documents  necessary  for Bank to use the  Patent
Collateral or to grant any exclusive or  non-exclusive  license under the Patent
Collateral  to any third  Person,  or to  assign,  pledge,  convey or  otherwise
transfer  title in, or dispose of, the Patent  Collateral  to any third  Person.
This power shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable for
the term of this Security Agreement. </FONT></P>

or nature,  including the  reasonable  attorney&#146;s  fees and legal  expenses
incurred by Bank in connection with the  preparation of this Security  Agreement
and  all  other  documents   relating  hereto  and  the   consummation  of  this
transaction,  the filing or recording of any documents  (including  all taxes in
connection  therewith) in public offices, the payment or discharge of any taxes,
counsel  fees,   maintenance   fees,   encumbrances  or  otherwise   protecting,
maintaining or preserving the Patent Collateral,  or in defending or prosecuting

any patent  applications  of the Patents pending as of the date of this Security
Agreement or thereafter  until the Obligations  shall have been paid in full, to
make  application  on  unpatented  but  patentable   inventions   unless  it  is
inconsistent  with  sound  commercial  practices  to do so and to  preserve  and
maintain all rights in patent applications and patents of the Patent Collateral,
including, without limitation, the payment of all maintenance fees. Any expenses
incurred in  connection  with such an  application  shall be borne by  Borrower.
Borrower  shall  not  abandon  any  right to file a patent  application,  or any
pending patent  application or patent without the consent of Bank, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Preservation  of Rights</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;No course of dealing between Borrower and Bank,
nor any failure to exercise  nor any delay in  exercising,  on the part of Bank,
any right,  power or  privilege  hereunder or under the Credit  Agreement  shall
operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
right, power or privilege  hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further
exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any  other  right,  power or  privilege.
