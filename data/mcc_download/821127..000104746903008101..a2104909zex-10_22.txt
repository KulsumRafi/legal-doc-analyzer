     This Amendment to the Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. Directors'

     one year and not later than ten years after the date they are granted,
     UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE."

2.   Section 8 of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a subsection (d) at the
end thereof as follows:

          "(d) Upon resignation or retirement from the Board, and provided
     the Director has served four three-year terms as a Director of the
     Company, each Director shall be awarded Non-Qualified Stock Options to
     purchase a total of 10,000 shares of Common Stock hereunder, subject to
     such restrictions, exercise limitations or other conditions as may be
     established from time to time by the Committee."

3.   Except as specifically amended hereby, the Plan shall continue in full
force and effect. From and after the date hereof, all references in any
agreements covering awards granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be
references to the Plan as hereby amended.
