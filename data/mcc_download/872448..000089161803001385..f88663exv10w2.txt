                                ATMEL CORPORATION

                        1991 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

                    (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MARCH 14, 2003)

      The following constitute the provisions of the 1991 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan of Atmel Corporation.

      1. Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company
and its Designated Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock of
the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. It is the intention of the
Company to have the Plan qualify as an "Employee Stock Purchase Plan" under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The provisions of
the Plan, accordingly, shall be construed so as to extend and limit
participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of that Section of
the Code.

      2. Definitions.

            (a) "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

            (b) "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Company for purposes of tax withholding under the Code whose customary
employment with the Company or any Designated Subsidiary is at least twenty (20)
hours per week and more than five (5) months in any calendar year. For purposes
of the Plan, the employment relationship shall be treated as continuing intact
while the individual is on sick leave or other leave of absence approved by the
Company. Where the period of leave exceeds 90 days and the individual's right to
reemployment is not guaranteed either by statute or by contract, the employment
relationship will be deemed to have terminated on the 91st day of such leave.

Period.

exchange or a national market system, including without limitation the National
Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
Quotation ("NASDAQ") System, its Fair Market Value shall be the closing sales
price for such stock (or the closing bid, if no sales were reported), as quoted
on such exchange (or the exchange with the greatest volume of trading in Common
Stock) or system on the last market trading day prior to the day of such
determination, as reported in the Wall Street Journal or such other source as
the Board deems reliable, or;

                  (2) If the Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ system (but
not on the National Market System thereof) or is regularly quoted by a
recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, its Fair
Market Value shall be the mean between the high and low asked prices for the
Common Stock on the last market trading day prior to the day of such
determination, as reported in the Wall Street Journal or such other source as
the Board deems reliable, or;

                  (3) In the absence of an established market for the Common
Stock, the Fair Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the
Board.

            (k) "Offering Period" shall mean a period of approximately six (6)
months, commencing on the first Trading Day on or after February 15 and
terminating on the last Trading Day in the period ending the following August
14, or commencing on the first Trading Day on or after August 15 and terminating

number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under
the Plan but not yet placed under option.

            (o) "Subsidiary" shall mean a corporation, domestic or foreign, of
which not less than 50 % of the voting shares are held by the Company or a
Subsidiary, whether or not such corporation now exists or is hereafter organized
or acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary.

            (p) "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which national stock exchanges
and the NASDAQ System are open for trading.



                                                                             -2-

      3. Eligibility.

            (a) Any Employee, as defined in paragraph 2, who has been
continuously employed by the Company for at least three (3) consecutive months
and who shall be employed by the Company on a given Enrollment Date shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan.

            (b) Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the
grant, such Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to
such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or
hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more
of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the
Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) which permits his or her
rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company
and its subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000) worth of stock (determined at the fair market value of the
shares at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such
option is outstanding at any time.

      4. Offering Periods. The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive Offering
Periods with a new Offering Period commencing on the first Trading Day on or
after February 15 and August 15 of each year, or on such other date as the Board
shall determine, and continuing thereafter until terminated in accordance with
paragraph 19 hereof. The Board shall have the power to change the duration of
Offering Periods with respect to future offerings without shareholder approval
if such change is announced at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled
beginning of the first Offering Period to be affected.

      5. Participation.

            (a) An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by
completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions in the form
of Exhibit A to this Plan and filing it with the Company's payroll office at
least ten (10) business days prior to the applicable Enrollment Date, unless a
later time for filing the subscription agreement is set by the Board for all
eligible Employees with respect to a given Offering Period.

            (b) Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on the first
payroll following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll in the
Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner
terminated by the participant as provided in paragraph 10.

      6. Payroll Deductions.

            (a) At the time a participant files his or her subscription
agreement, he or she shall elect to have deductions made on each payday during
the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) and not less
than two percent (2%) of the Compensation which he or she receives on each
payday during the Offering Period, and the aggregate of such payroll deductions
during the Offering Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) or be less than
two percent (2%) of the participant's Compensation during said offering Period.



                                                                             -3-
<PAGE>
            (b) All payroll deductions made for a participant shall be credited
to his or her account under the Plan and will be withheld in whole percentages
only. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account.

            (c) A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the
Plan as provided in paragraph 10, or may decrease the rate of his or her payroll
deductions during the Offering Period by completing or filing with the Company a
new subscription agreement authorizing a change in payroll deduction rate. The
Board shall be authorized to limit the number of participation rate changes
during any Offering Period. The change in rate shall be effective with the first
full payroll period following ten (10) business days after the Company's receipt
of the new subscription agreement unless the Company elects to process a given
change in participation more quickly. A participant's subscription agreement
shall remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as
provided in paragraph 10.

            (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and paragraph 3(b) herein, a participant's
payroll deductions may be decreased to 0% at such time during any Offering
Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year (the "Current
Offering Period") that the aggregate of all payroll deductions which were
previously used to purchase stock under the Plan in a prior Offering Period
which ended during that calendar year plus all payroll deductions accumulated
with respect to the Current Offering Period equal $21,250. Payroll deductions
shall recommence at the rate provided in such participant's subscription
agreement at the beginning of the first Offering Period which is scheduled to
end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the participant as
provided in paragraph 10.

            (e) At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at
the time some or all of the Company's Common Stock issued under the Plan is
disposed of, the participant must make adequate provision for the Company's
federal, state, or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon
the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock. At any time,
the Company may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the participant's
compensation the amount necessary for the Company to meet applicable withholding
obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company
any tax deductions or benefit attributable to sale or early disposition of
Common Stock by the Employee.

      7. Grant of Option. On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each
eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an
option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the
applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of the Company's Common
Stock determined by dividing such Employee's payroll deductions accumulated
prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Participant's account as of the
Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided that in no event shall
an Employee be permitted to purchase during each Offering Period more than two
hundred percent (200%) of the number of shares determined by dividing $12,500 by
the fair market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Enrollment
Date, and provided further that such purchase shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 3(b) and 12 hereof. Exercise of the option
shall occur as provided in Section 8, unless the participant has withdrawn
pursuant to Section 10, and shall expire on the last day of the Offering Period.



                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>
      8. Exercise of Option. Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as
provided in paragraph 10 below, his or her option for the purchase of shares
will be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of
full shares subject to option shall be purchased for such participant at the
applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her
account. No fractional shares will be purchased; any payroll deductions
accumulated in a participant's account which are not sufficient to purchase a
full share shall be retained in the participant's account for the subsequent
Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the participant as provided in
paragraph 10. Any other monies left over in a participant's account after the
Exercise Date shall be returned to the participant. During a participant's
lifetime, a participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable
only by him or her.

      9. Delivery. As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date on which
a purchase of shares occurs, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each
participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares purchased
upon exercise of his or her option.

      10. Withdrawal; Termination of Employment.

            (a) A participant may withdraw all but not less than all the payroll
deductions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or
her option under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company in
the form of Exhibit B to this Plan. All of the participant's payroll deductions
credited to his or her account will be paid to such participant promptly after
receipt of notice of withdrawal and such participant's option for the Offering
Period will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for
the purchase of shares will be made during the Offering Period. If a participant
withdraws from an Offering Period, payroll deductions will not resume at the
beginning of the succeeding Offering Period unless the participant delivers to
the Company a new subscription agreement.

            (b) Upon a participant's ceasing to be an Employee for any reason or
upon termination of a participant's employment relationship (as described in
Section 2(g)), the payroll deductions credited to such participant's account
during the Offering Period but not yet used to exercise the option will be
returned to such participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person
or persons entitled thereto under paragraph 14, and such participant's option
will be automatically terminated.

            (c) In the event an Employee fails to remain an Employee of the
Company for at least twenty (20) hours per week during an Offering Period in
which the Employee is a participant, he or she will be deemed to have elected to
withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to his or her account
will be returned to such participant and such participant's option terminated.

            (d) A participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have
any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan which
may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods which
commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the participant
withdraws.



                                                                             -5-
<PAGE>
      11. Interest. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a
participant in the Plan.

      12. Stock.

            (a) The maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which
shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be 42,000,000 shares,
subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided
in paragraph 18; provided, however, that beginning January 1, 2004, such number
of shares shall be increased annually each January 1 by an amount equal to one
half of one percent (0.5%) of the then outstanding shares on such date or such
lesser amount as determined by the Board. If on a given Exercise Date the number
of shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number
of shares then available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata
allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner
as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.

            (b) The participant will have no interest or voting right in shares
covered by his option until such option has been exercised.

            (c) Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will be
registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and
his or her spouse.

      13. Administration.

            (a) Administrative Body. The Plan shall be administered by the Board
of the Company or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board.
The Board or its committee shall have full and exclusive discretionary authority
to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility
and to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan. Every finding,
decision and determination made by the Board or its committee shall, to the fall
extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties. Members of the
Board who are eligible Employees are permitted to participate in the Plan,
provided that:

                  (1) Members of the Board who are eligible to participate in
the Plan may not vote on any matter affecting the administration of the Plan or
the grant of any option pursuant to the Plan.

                  (2) If a Committee is established to administer the Plan, no
member of the Board who is eligible to participate in the Plan may be a member
of the Committee.

            (b) Rule 16b-3 Limitations. Notwithstanding the provisions of
SubSection (a) of this Section 13, in the event that Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor
provision ("Rule 16b-3") provides specific requirements for the administrators
of plans of this type, the Plan shall be only administered by such a body and in
such a manner as shall comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3.
Unless permitted by Rule 16b-3, no discretion concerning decisions regarding the
Plan shall be afforded to any committee or person that is not "disinterested" as
that term is used in Rule l6b-3.



                                                                             -6-
<PAGE>
      14. Designation of Beneficiary.

            (a) A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary
who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account
under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to an
Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but prior to delivery to such
participant of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a
written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the
participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death
prior to exercise of the option.

            (b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the
participant at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a
participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the
Plan who is living at the time of such participant's death, the Company shall
deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate
of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed
(to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver
such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or
relatives of the participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to
the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.

      15. Transferability. Neither payroll deductions credited to a
participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or
to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution or as provided in paragraph 14 hereof) by the participant. Any such
attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without
effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw
funds from an Offering Period in accordance with paragraph 10.

      16. Use of Funds. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company
under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the
Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.

      17. Reports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant
in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees at
least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll
deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining
cash balance, if any.

      18. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required
action by the shareholders of the Company, the Reserves as well as the price per
share of Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet
been exercised, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease
in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the
Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of
Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided,
however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration". Such
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall
be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issue
by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into
shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment

                                                                             -7-
<PAGE>
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares
of Common Stock subject to an option.

      In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company,
the Offering Period will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such
proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. In the event of a
proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the
merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each option under the
Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such
successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation,
unless the Board determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu
of such assumption or substitution, to shorten the Offering Period then in
progress by setting a new Exercise Date (the "New Exercise Date"). If the Board
shortens the Offering Period then in progress in lieu of assumption or
substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify
each participant in writing, at least ten (10) days prior to the New Exercise
Date, that the Exercise Date for his option has been changed to the New Exercise
Date and that his option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise
Date, unless prior to such date he has withdrawn from the Offering Period as
provided in paragraph 10. For purposes of this paragraph, an option granted
under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or
merger, the option confers the right to purchase, for each share of option stock
subject to the option immediately prior to the sale of assets or merger, the
consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in
the sale of assets or merger by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common
Stock held on the effective date of the transaction (and if such holders were
offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided,
however, that if such consideration received in the sale of assets or merger was
not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent (as defined
in Section 424(e) of the Code), the Board may, with the consent of the successor
corporation and the participant, provide for the consideration to be received
upon exercise of the option to be solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock and the sale of assets or
merger.

      The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole discretion,
also make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price per share
of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, in the event the Company
effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or
other increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding Common Stock, and in
the event of the Company being consolidated with or merged into any other
corporation.

      19. Amendment or Termination.

            (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time and for
any reason terminate or amend the Plan. Except as provided in paragraph 18, no
such termination can affect options previously granted, provided that an
Offering Period may be terminated by the Board of Directors on any Exercise Date
if the Board determines that the termination of the Plan is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders. Except as provided in paragraph
18, no amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which
adversely affects the rights of any participant. To the extent necessary to
comply with Rule 16b-3 or under Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule
or provision or any other applicable law or regulation), the Company shall
obtain shareholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as required.



                                                                             -8-
<PAGE>
            (b) Without shareholder consent and without regard to whether any
participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the
Board (or its committee) shall be entitled to change the Offering Periods, limit
the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering
Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the
amount designated by a participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in
the Company's processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish
reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting
procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock
for each participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the
participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures
as the Board (or its-committee) determines in its sole discretion advisable
which are consistent with the Plan.

      20. Notices. All notices or other communications by a participant to the
Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly
given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by
the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.

      21. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued with
respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and
delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable
provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements
of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be
further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.

      As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the
person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such
exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any
present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the
aforementioned applicable provisions of law.

      22. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon the earlier to
occur of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the
shareholders of the Company. It shall continue in effect for a term of twenty
(20) years unless sooner terminated under paragraph 19.

      23. Additional Restrictions of Rule 16b-3. The terms and conditions of
options granted hereunder to, and the purchase of shares by, persons subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall comply with the applicable provisions of
Rule 16b-3. This Plan shall be deemed to contain, and such options shall
contain, and the shares issued upon exercise thereof shall be subject to, such
additional conditions and restrictions as may be required by Rule 16b-3 to
qualify for the maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with
respect to Plan transactions.



                                                                             -9-

      1. _________________________________hereby elects to participate in the
Atmel Corporation 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Employee Stock
Purchase Plan") and subscribes to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock
in accordance with this Subscription Agreement and the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.

      2. I hereby authorize payroll deductions from each paycheck in the amount
of ____% of my Compensation on each payday (minimum deduction to be 2% and
maximum deduction to be 10%) during the Offering Period in accordance with the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (Please note that no fractional percentages are
permitted.)

      3. I understand that said payroll deductions shall be accumulated for the
purchase of shares of Common Stock at the applicable Purchase Price determined
in accordance with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. I understand that if I do
not withdraw from an Offering Period, any accumulated payroll deductions will be
used to automatically exercise my option.

      4. I have received a copy of the complete "Atmel Corporation 1991 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan." I understand that my participation in the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan is in all respects subject to the terms of the Plan. I understand
that the grant of the option by the Company under this Subscription Agreement is
subject to obtaining shareholder approval of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

      5. Shares purchased for me under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan should
be issued in the name(s) of:_________________________________________.

      6. I understand that if I dispose of any shares received by me pursuant to
the Plan within 2 years after the Enrollment Date (the first day of the offering
Period during which I purchased such shares), I will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as having received ordinary income at the time of such
disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the market value of the shares
at the time such shares were delivered to me over the price which I paid for the
shares. I hereby agree to notify the Company in writing within 30 days after the
date of any such disposition and I will make adequate provision for Federal,
State or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon the
disposition of the Common Stock. The Company may, but will not be obligated to,
withhold from my compensation the amount necessary to meet any applicable
withholding obligation including any withholding necessary to make available to
the Company any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early
disposition of Common Stock by me. If I dispose of such shares

at any time after the expiration of the 2-year holding period, I understand that
I will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received income only
at the time of such disposition, and that such income will be taxed as ordinary
income only to the extent of an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the excess of
the fair market value of the shares at the time of such disposition over the
purchase price which I paid for the shares, or (2) 15% of the fair market value
of the shares on the first day of the Offering Period. The remainder of the
gain, if any, recognized on such disposition will be taxed as capital gain.

      7. I hereby agree to be bound by the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. The effectiveness of this Subscription Agreement is dependent upon my
eligibility to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

      8. In the event of my death, I hereby designate the following as my

Stock Purchase Plan:
