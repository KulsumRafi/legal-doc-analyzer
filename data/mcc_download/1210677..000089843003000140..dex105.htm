Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so. In the event that the prevailing party in arbitration seeks enforcement of the arbitration award in a court of law,
the prevailing party in that court action will be entitled to be reimbursed for its costs and attorneys&#146; fees. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">During and after the
