Common Stock subject to such Stock Option, and (B)&nbsp;the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable more than five years from the date of grant thereof. No Incentive Stock Option may be granted
under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Plan by the Board. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive
Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, the excess Stock Options
