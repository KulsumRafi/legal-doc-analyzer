<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Borrower, Agent and the Banks hereto have heretofore entered into a Backup Facility Agreement dated as of October 26, 2001 (as amended prior to the Restatement Effective Date referred to below, the "<U>Backup Facility Agreement</U>"), and such parties, the Investors, Lessor, Lessee and certain other Persons have entered into the Participation Agreement referred to therein (as amended prior to the Restatement Effective Date referred to below, the "<U>Participation Agreement</U>"), and certain other Operative Agreements (as such term is defined in accordance with Section 1 below);</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, at the date hereof, there are no Facility Loans outstanding under the Backup Facility Agreement; and</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the Backup Facility Agreement, the Participation Agreement and certain other Operative Agreements as set forth herein and to restate the Backup Facility Agreement in its entirety to read as set forth in the Backup Facility Agreement with the amendments specified below;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Defined Terms; References.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, each term used herein which is defined in Annex A to the Participation Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to such term in such Annex A. Each reference to "<B>hereof</B>", "<B>hereunder</B>", "<B>herein</B>" and "<B>hereby</B>" and each other similar reference and each reference to "<B>this Agreement</B>" and each other similar reference contained in the Backup Facility Agreement shall, after the Restatement Effective Date, refer to the Backup Facility Agreement as amended and restated hereby.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Amendments</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Restatement Effective Date:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Operative Agreements are amended by changing each reference to "The Chase Manhattan Bank" to "JPMorgan Chase Bank".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Backup Facility Agreement, the Banks agree that the current "Expiry Date" of November 7, 2002 shall be, and is hereby, extended to November 6, 2003, and each undersigned Bank shall remain a party to the Backup Facility Agreement as a Bank with an obligation to make (i) Revolving Facility Loans prior to its new Expiry Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the amount of the Commitment set forth below, and (ii) a Term Loan in the amount of such Commitment on the terms set forth in the Backup Facility Agreement, in each case as such amounts may be adjusted from time to time as provided in the Backup Facility Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.3 of the Participation Agreement, (i) the requirement that a Purchasing Bank be an Eligible Assignee may be waived by the Lessee in its sole and absolute discretion, without the requirement for any consent or waiver from any other party, and (ii) in the event that Lessee consents to a Purchasing Bank that is not an Eligible Assignee, the assigning Bank may assign Term Loans held by it to such Purchasing Bank, and in connection therewith, all the terms and provisions of Section 11.3 shall apply to such assignment (other than clause (a)(iv)).  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower and Banks agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 14.5 of the Participation Agreement, if the SPC (or Lessee pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Participation Agreement) exercises any of its rights in Section 4.4 of the Backup Facility Agreement to require a Termed Out Bank to assign its Term Loan to a Term Loan Purchaser, and if such Term Loan Purchaser is an Eligible Assignee, then, the Agent Bank shall have the power and authority (without obtaining any consent or approval from the Borrower or any other Bank), but without any obligation to do so, to enter into such amendments to the Backup Facility Agreement and other Operative Agreements, deliver such notices and agreements, and take such other actions, as may be requested by the SPC (or Lessee) (in each case at the Lessee's sole cost and expense), in order to authorize the Term Loan held by such Term Loan Purchaser to be repaid from the proceeds of the issuance of Commercial Paper and replaced by a revolving Commitment of such Term Loan Purchaser (on all of the terms and conditions applicable to the Commitments of the Banks that are contained in the Backup Facility Agreement and other Operative Agreements), provided that the CP Administrative Agent and the Agent Bank shall have received written confirmation from S&amp;P and Moody's that, immediately after giving effect to such Term Loan Purchaser's revolving Commitment, the then-current rating of the Commercial Paper shall not be qualified, reduced or withdrawn as a result thereof.  No such amendment or replacement shall increase the aggregate Commitment of the Banks and the Term Loan Purchaser beyond the aggregate Commitment of the Banks in effect prior to the funding of the Term Loan purchased by such Term Loan Purchaser.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Restatement Effective Date, the definition of "Indebtedness" contained in Annex A to the Participation Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following sentence at the end thereof:  </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that, in the case of Lessee, "Indebtedness" shall not include any reimbursement, indemnification, payment or similar obligations of Lessee with respect to any appeal or surety bonds issued for the benefit of Lessee in order to stay (whether by statute or contract) the enforcement against Lessee of the judgment obtained by the City of Hope in June 2002 or any interest accruing thereon, to the extent, but only to the extent, </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banks agree that the Backup Facility Agreement and the Participation Agreement are each amended, as of the Restatement Effective Date, by replacing the Commitment amounts on the signature pages thereof with the Commitments shown on <U>Schedule 1</U> attached hereto.  </P>

Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Participation Agreement and the Operative Agreements (together with any consent or waiver heretofore delivered pursuant thereto) are and shall remain in full force and effect. </P>
