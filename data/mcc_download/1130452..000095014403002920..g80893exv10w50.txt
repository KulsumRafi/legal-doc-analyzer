      WHEREAS, BellSouth and SBC own all of the issued and outstanding equity
interests in the Company;

      WHEREAS, Mr. Carter has agreed to terminate his employment relationship
with the Company on December 30, 2002; and

      WHEREAS, the parties agree that in connection with Mr. Carter's
termination of employment on December 30, 2002, Mr. Carter should receive
additional benefits and consideration as set forth herein, and that Mr. Carter,
among other things, should release and forever discharge Company, SBC, BellSouth
and any and all of their respective subsidiaries (which term when used
throughout this document shall include entities in which the company referred to
owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent or more of the outstanding equity
interests), their respective officers, directors, agents, servants, employees,
successors and assigns and any and all employee benefit plans maintained by
Company, BellSouth SBC or any subsidiary thereof and/or any and all fiduciaries

action or suits of any kind whatsoever, arising from or in connection with Mr.
Carter's employment by Company or SBC (and their respective subsidiaries) and/or
Mr. Carter's separation therefrom, all as set forth in more detail in the
Release and Waiver contained herein.

      NOW, therefore, the parties further agree as follows:

      1. Mr. Carter's employment relationship with the Company shall terminate

effective as of November 6, 2002, Mr. Carter has been released from all

benefit plans, Mr. Carter's termination of employment shall be treated as an
involuntary termination by Company without cause. Mr. Carter agrees, for one
year following his termination of employment, to reasonably cooperate with the
Company and its counsel (with the Company responsible for all reasonable costs)
in both responding to information requests and otherwise responding to any
lawsuits or other legal claims.

      2. Mr. Carter shall execute this Agreement and the Release and Waiver
contained herein and the Company shall pay Mr. Carter within ten days after the
Release and Waiver contained herein can no longer be revoked, a lump sum payment
in the amount of $2,256,500, less regular and customary withholdings for
federal, state and local income and social security taxes.

      Included in the $2,256,500 lump sum payment is $2,150,000, which is a lump
sum severance payment and $106,500, which is a lump sum payment for outplacement
services. Additionally, Mr. Carter shall receive a 2002 Short Term Incentive
Award applicable to the 2002 Award Year in accordance with the terms of the plan
governing Short Term Incentive Award payments (i.e., prorated to date of
termination), including any adjustments for financial performance as provided in
the applicable plan.

      For eighteen (18) months following his termination of employment, the
Company shall pay and Mr. Carter shall receive reimbursement of any amounts he
pays to continue coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") in the health plans he participated in
immediately prior to his termination of employment, including the Cingular
Executive Health Plan. Such reimbursements shall be grossed up for federal,
state and local income tax, as applicable to Mr. Carter at the time the
reimbursement payments are made. Such reimbursement payments shall be made
semi-annually.

      If Mr. Carter commences the relocation of his primary residence within six
(6) months of his termination of employment, the Company shall pay and Mr.
Carter shall receive relocation benefits as if he were an eligible participant
in the Cingular Relocation Plan; provided, however, the provisions of the
Cingular Relocation Plan regarding the purchase of a participant's home shall
not apply; provided, further, however, the relocation benefits described in this
paragraph shall not exceed a maximum aggregate limit of $350,000, including any
applicable income tax gross up. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to
the contrary, no relocation benefits shall be paid or reimbursed pursuant to
this paragraph with respect to eligible relocation expenses incurred on or after
December 31, 2003, and no relocation benefits will be provided hereunder if such
relocation is in connection with an employment opportunity made available to Mr.
Carter.

      SBC agrees to extend the period in which Mr. Carter is allowed to exercise
the following vested SBC stock options issued under the SBC 1996 Stock &
Incentive Plan until December 30, 2005, which right to exercise such stock
options would otherwise expire on December 30, 2003:

      SBC acknowledges that the original term of the foregoing options, which is
not being extended hereunder, is longer than the extended term in which such
options are eligible for exercise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In
all other respects, the terms of the SBC 1996 Stock & Incentive Plan and the
option grant documents applicable to such stock options shall continue to apply.

      For one year following his termination of employment, Mr. Carter shall be
entitled to receive benefits under the terms and conditions of the Officer
Communications Policy under which Mr. Carter was receiving benefits on his last
day of employment as if Mr. Carter retired from the Company, as such policy may
be amended from time-to-time.

      Mr. Carter shall be treated no less favorably than the officers of the
Company in the determination and calculation of the payment to be received under
the Cingular Wireless Short Term Incentive Plan with respect to his 2002 award
payable in 2003, if any.

      The Company agrees to indemnify Mr. Carter from and against any claims
that relate to and accrued during his employment by the Company to the same
degree and extent Mr. Carter was entitled to indemnification from the Company
during his employment. Further, Company agrees to maintain D&O insurance
covering Mr. Carter with respect to claims that accrued during his employment by
the Company to the same degree and extent such D&O insurance was provided during
his employment.

      The consideration described in this Paragraph 2 shall be in lieu of, and
Mr. Carter hereby specifically waives any right to any other termination pay
allowance as a consequence of Mr. Carter's termination of employment.

      3. The Company hereby agrees to provide Mr. Carter on and after the date
of Mr. Carter's termination of employment (and after the Release and Waiver
contained herein can no longer be revoked) with the benefits in the amounts and
as generally described in Attachment A (which is incorporated herein by this
reference) and more fully detailed herein below, which are referred to herein as
Mr. Carter's "Equivalent SRIP." Such benefits reflect a modification of, and
shall be in lieu of, the benefits that would ordinarily be provided to Mr.
Carter pursuant to the Cingular Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (the
"SRIP"), a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this
reference. Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP shall be provided in accordance with,
and be governed in all respects by, the terms of the SRIP, except as provided
below:

      (a)   The three (3) year period referenced in section 7.2 of the SRIP is
            deleted and a two (2) year period is substituted therefore; and

      (b)   Mr. Carter elects for Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP, the form of
            retirement benefit listed below next to which Mr. Carter has
            subscribed his initials.

                              Section 3.3(a) of the SRIP.

                              Section 3.3(c) of the SRIP.

The consideration described in this Paragraph 3 shall be in lieu of, and Mr.
Carter hereby specifically waives any right to any and all benefits under the
SRIP which Mr. Carter would otherwise become eligible for and entitled to on and
after the date of Mr. Carter's termination of employment.

      4. Except as agreed herein, this Agreement and the Release and Waiver
contained herein do not abrogate any of the usual entitlements which Mr. Carter
has or will have, first, while a regular employee and subsequently, upon
termination of employment as a former employee. These may include, among others:

      (a)   Customary and regular health care, disability and life insurance and
            survivor benefits for which Mr. Carter may qualify subject to and in
            accordance with the terms of applicable plans of Company, SBC,
            BellSouth and their respective subsidiaries; and

      (b)   The distribution of benefits, if any, under the SBC 1992 Stock
            Option Plan, SBC 1996 Stock and Incentive Plan, SBC 2001 Incentive
            Plan, SBC Stock Savings Plan, Cingular Wireless Pension Benefit
            Plan, Cingular Wireless Savings Plan, Cingular Wireless Short Term
            Incentive Plan, Cingular Wireless Long Term Incentive Plan, Cingular
            Wireless Cash Deferral Plan, Cingular Wireless Pension Make-up Plan,
            Cingular Wireless Supplemental Retirement Transition Plan, Cingular
            Wireless Executive Life Insurance Plan, and Cingular Wireless
            Executive Health Plan.

      Except as provided herein, all of said benefits will be subject to and
provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective benefit
plans as applicable to Mr. Carter.

      Further, it is hereby acknowledged in accordance with the provisions of
this Paragraph 4 that Mr. Carter shall be entitled to $60,077.60 in lieu of the
2002 vacation/personal/EWP/DH/FH days that Mr. Carter has not utilized prior to
Mr. Carter's termination of employment and such payment shall be paid to Mr.
Carter within ten days after the Release and Waiver contained herein can no
longer be revoked.

      Further, Company, SBC, and their respective subsidiaries have reserved the
right to end or amend any or all of its plans referred to in this Paragraph 4.
Each participating subsidiary in each plan has reserved the right to end its
participation in these plans and to discontinue

providing any and all such benefits. If any of the plans should be terminated or
changed, to the extent that such action may apply to Mr. Carter, it is subject
to the terms and conditions of the specific plan and applicable law; provided,
however, the Company, SBC and their respective subsidiaries agree not to amend
any plan in a manner that causes such amendment to have an adverse impact solely
on Mr. Carter and no other plan participant. This means, for example, that Mr.
Carter will not acquire a lifetime right to any health care plan benefit or to
the continuation of any health care plan merely by reason of the fact that such
benefit or plan is in existence at the time of Mr. Carter's termination of
employment or because of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained
herein. Thus, Mr. Carter's rights/entitlements to any benefit under any of the
plans referred to in this Paragraph are no different as a result of entering
into this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein than they would
have been in the absence of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained
herein.

      5. Mr. Carter and Mr. Carter's spouse, estate and/or designated
beneficiaries shall have no rights, claims or interests in any assets of
Company, SBC, BellSouth or any subsidiaries thereof; nor, except for any
benefits paid pursuant to any employee benefit plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall any
such assets be required to be held under any trust for the benefit of Mr.
Carter, Mr. Carter's spouse, estate and/or designated beneficiaries or held in
any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of Company,
SBC, BellSouth or any of their subsidiaries under this Agreement and the Release
and Waiver contained herein. Any and all of the assets of Company, SBC,
BellSouth and/or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be, and remain, the
general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of Company, SBC, BellSouth and/or their
respective subsidiaries. Company's, BellSouth's and SBC's obligations under this
Agreement shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay
money.

      If the Company establishes rabbi trusts ("Trusts") for the purpose of
providing for the payment of benefits under the SRIP, the assets of such Trusts
would be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors under certain
circumstances as set forth in the Trust documents. Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP
benefits hereunder shall be included in such Trusts, if any, to the same extent
as are the benefits of regular SRIP participants; provided, however, for
purposes of computing Mr. Carter's vested benefits for purposes of determining
the Trust funding level, if any, applicable for Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP
benefits, the security afforded Mr. Carter thereby shall be no different as a
result of entering into this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained
herein than they would have been had Mr. Carter continued in employment in the
absence of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein. To the
extent any benefits provided hereunder are actually paid from such Trust, if
any, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to
the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall
be paid by the Company. Notwithstanding any provisions herein, it is hereby
specifically agreed that Mr. Carter shall be recognized as a participant of the
SRIP for purposes of determining the coverage of the Trust, if any, for the
SRIP.

      6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Mr. Carter
agrees that, without the written consent of the Company and while employed by
the Company or within two (2) years after termination of such employment, he
will not engage in competition with SBC,

BellSouth or the Company or with any business with which SBC, BellSouth, the
Company or any subsidiary thereof has a substantial interest (collectively
referred to herein as "Employer business"), and that he will cease and desist
from engaging in said competitive activity within 120 days following receipt of
written notice from SBC, BellSouth or the Company to Mr. Carter demanding that
Mr. Carter cease and desist from engaging in said competitive activity. In
addition to any other remedies that may be available to the Company, SBC,
BellSouth or their respective subsidiaries, if Mr. Carter breaches the
provisions of this Paragraph 6, he shall return, and the Company, SBC, BellSouth
and their respective subsidiaries shall be entitled to collect, the
consideration that they paid or provided under Paragraph 2 of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein,
engaging in competition with any Employer business shall mean engaging by Mr.
Carter in any business or activity in the same geographical market where the
same or substantially similar business or activity is being carried on as an
Employer business on the date of this Agreement. Such term shall not include
owning a nonsubstantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business
that competes with an Employer business. However, it is hereby specifically
agreed that engaging in competition with an Employer business shall include
representing or providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any
person or entity that is engaged in competition with any Employer business and
Mr. Carter hereby specifically agrees not to engage in any such conduct. Mr.
Carter also specifically agrees that a breach of this provision would result if,
within the time period and without the written consent specified, Mr. Carter
either engages directly in competitive activity or in any capacity in any
location becomes employed by, associated with, or renders service to any
company, or parent or affiliate thereof, or any subsidiary of any of them, if
any of them is engaged in competition with an Employer business, regardless of
the position or duties Mr. Carter takes and regardless of whether or not the
employing company, or the company that Mr. Carter becomes associated with or
renders service to, is itself engaged in direct competition with an Employer
business. Mr. Carter further acknowledges that engaging in competition with an
Employer business in violation of this Paragraph 6 will result in immediate and
irreparable harm to the Company, SBC, BellSouth and/or their respective
subsidiaries, for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and that the
Company, SBC, BellSouth or such subsidiary thereof will be entitled to equitable
relief to restrain Mr. Carter from violating the terms of this Paragraph 6, in
addition to any other remedies available to the Company, SBC, BellSouth or such
subsidiary thereof.

      Mr. Carter may submit a description of any proposed activity in writing to
the most senior human resources officer of the Company, and the Company shall
advise Mr. Carter in writing within ten business days whether such proposed
activity would constitute engaging in competition with an Employer business in
violation of this Paragraph 6.

      7. Mr. Carter acknowledges that, as a result of Mr. Carter's employment by
the Company, SBC or any of their respective subsidiaries Mr. Carter has and will
continue to have until Mr. Carter's termination of employment, access to trade
secrets, intellectual property, proprietary information, and private non-public
information including technological, legal, financial, marketing, personnel and
other information (including, specifically, this Agreement and the Release and
Waiver contained herein) relating to litigation, the business and contemplated
business of the Company, SBC, BellSouth and their respective subsidiaries and

and/or their respective subsidiaries ("Confidential Information"); and Mr.
Carter agrees that he will not, before or after his termination of employment,
divulge or in any way make available to others through public statements,
voluntary testimony, or otherwise, or make use of, alone or in concert with
others, any Confidential Information. The aforesaid obligations regarding
Confidential Information will not apply to (i) information that is now in or
hereafter enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement and the
Release and Waiver contained herein, (ii) information required to be delivered
pursuant to a subpoena or similar legislative, judicial or administrative
requirement; provided, however, Mr. Carter will notify the Company, SBC and
BellSouth upon receipt of any such subpoena or similar request to the extent it
relates to such company's Confidential Information, and give the Company, SBC
and/or BellSouth, as the case may be, a reasonable opportunity to contest or
otherwise oppose the subpoena or similar request, (iii) information that is not
a trade secret three (3) years after Mr. Carter's termination of employment with
the Company (but will include information that constitutes a trade secret under
applicable law), (iv) information filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that is not subject to a request for confidential treatment
made to the SEC or any other governmental agency or authority, (v) information
that becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an
improper disclosure by Mr. Carter, (vi) information that becomes available to
Mr. Carter, directly or indirectly, from a source other than Company, SBC or
BellSouth (or their respective subsidiaries), provided that such source is not
known by Mr. Carter (or that he should not reasonably know) to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other obligation of secrecy to, Company, SBC,
BellSouth or their respective subsidiaries.

      It is hereby agreed that Mr. Carter may represent himself as a former
employee of Company, SBC and their respective subsidiaries as factually
applicable; but otherwise Mr. Carter agrees that Mr. Carter will not make, nor
cause to be made any public statements, disclosures or publications which relate
in any way, directly or indirectly to Mr. Carter's cessation of employment with
the Company, SBC and/or their respective subsidiaries without prior written
approval by the Company and SBC. Mr. Carter also agrees that Mr. Carter will not
make, nor cause to be made any public statements, disclosures or publications
which portray unfavorably, reflect adversely on, or are derogatory or inimical
to the best interests of, the Company, SBC, BellSouth, their subsidiaries,
directors, officers, employees and agents, past, present or future. Any
inquiries regarding Mr. Carter's termination of employment of which the most
senior human resources officer of the Company or SBC have actual knowledge prior
to a response being given, other than ministerial inquiries regarding Mr.
Carter's term of employment and other ministerial employment verification
inquiries, shall be addressed solely by the Company's or SBC's most senior human
resources officer.

      8. Mr. Carter agrees that during the two (2) year period immediately after
termination of Mr. Carter's employment with Company, Mr. Carter will not,
without the Company's consent, exclusively target for solicitation groups of
customers of Company, SBC, BellSouth or any of their respective subsidiaries on
behalf of Mr. Carter or any other person or entity or solicit any individual
that is, at that time, employed by the Company, SBC, BellSouth or any subsidiary

will negatively impact the morale, commitment and performance of the employee in

immediate and irreparable harm to the Company, SBC, BellSouth and/or their

and the Release and Waiver contained herein shall be null and void, and
unenforceable by either party.

      12. Mr. Carter agrees that for any breach or threatened breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein by

Paragraph 3 of this Agreement to Mr. Carter with the attendant rights and
obligations provided by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as
amended ("ERISA"), and the provisions of this Agreement relating to Mr. Carter's
Equivalent SRIP will be considered an employee benefit plan under Section 3(3)
of ERISA. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the
provisions of this Agreement relating to Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP shall be
governed by ERISA and to the extent not preempted by ERISA, by the laws of the
State of Texas excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that
might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement and the
Release and Waiver contained herein to the substantive law of another
jurisdiction. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the
other provisions of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas excluding any conflicts or
choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or
interpretation of this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein to
the substantive law of another jurisdiction. To achieve certainty regarding the
appropriate forum in which to prosecute and defend actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to the provisions
regarding Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP, which the parties agree is a material
condition of entering into this Agreement, the parties agree and acknowledge
that (a) the sole and exclusive venue for any such action shall be an
appropriate federal or state court in Bexar County, Texas, and no other, (b) all
claims with respect to any such action shall be heard and determined exclusively
in such Bexar County, Texas court, and no other, (c) such Bexar County, Texas
court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties
and over the subject matter of any dispute relating

hereto, and (d) that the parties waive any and all objections and defenses to
bringing any such action before such Bexar County, Texas court, including but
not limited to those relating to lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue
or forum non conveniens.

      The Company shall be the named fiduciary with respect to the Equivalent
SRIP provisions of this Agreement. As such, the Company shall have the sole
discretion to interpret the provisions of this Agreement relating to Mr.
Carter's Equivalent SRIP, determine Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP benefits and
establish such rules and procedures, consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement relating to Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP and ERISA, as it may deem
necessary or appropriate.

      Equivalent SRIP Claims and Review Procedures.

      (a)   If Mr. Carter disputes the amount of Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP
            benefits hereunder, Mr. Carter may file a written claim for the
            different amount with the Company's Vice President-Compensation.

            In order to be valid, a claim relating to Mr. Carter's Equivalent
            SRIP benefits must be filed within 60 days after the receipt of the
            disputed payment of benefits, or within 60 days after the
            termination or death or other event on which the claim is based.

If such a claim is denied by the Vice President-Compensation, in whole or in
part, Mr. Carter will receive written notice of the denial within 60 days after
the date the claim was received. If more than 60 days is needed to make a
decision, then written notice of the reasons will be provided to Mr. Carter
within said 60 days, and a final written notice of the decision will be provided
within 180 days. A notice denying a claim will contain the specific reasons for
the denial, specific references to the provisions of this Agreement relating to
the Equivalent SRIP on which the denial is based, a description of any
information or material necessary to perfect the claim, an explanation of why
such material is necessary, and an explanation of the Review Procedure
(described below). If no decision is reported within the 60 or 180-day period
described in this Paragraph, the claim will be deemed to be denied.

      (b)   If Mr. Carter's claim relating to Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP
            benefits is denied (or such claim is deemed to have been denied),
            Mr. Carter has the right to request a review of the denial by
            submitting a written request to the Administrative Committee
            ("Committee") appointed by the Company. The request for review must
            be filed within 60 days after the denial (or deemed denial) of the
            initial claim, and should be addressed as follows:

                           Administrative Committee
                           c/o Vice President-Compensation

            The Committee will provide a written decision on a request for
            review within 60 days after its receipt of the request, unless
            special circumstances require additional time. If additional time is
            required, written notice of the reasons will be provided to Mr.
            Carter within 60 days, and a final written decision will be provided
            within 120 days. If the Committee affirms the denial (or deemed
            denial) of such claim, the written notice will contain the specific
            reasons for the decision and specific references to the provisions
            of this Agreement relating to the Equivalent SRIP on which it is
            based. If no decision is reported within the 60 or 120-day period
            described in this Paragraph, the initial denial of such claim will
            be deemed to have been affirmed by the Committee.

      ERISA Rights

            As a participant entitled to the Equivalent SRIP benefit under this
            Agreement, which is a plan covered by ERISA, Mr. Carter is entitled
            to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that
            all participants in plans that are subject to ERISA are entitled to
            examine, without charge, all documents that constitute part of this
            Agreement as it relates to Mr. Carter's Equivalent SRIP, including
            any documents and reports that are filed with a federal government
            agency. These documents are available for review at the offices of
            the Company. If Mr. Carter is unable to examine these documents
            there, Mr. Carter should write to:

                           Vice President-Compensation
                           175 East Houston
                           San Antonio, Texas  78205

            specifying the documents Mr. Carter wants to examine and at which
            work location Mr. Carter wants to examine them. Copies of the
            requested documents will be made available for examination at the
            specific work location within 10 days after the date the request is
            received.

            Mr. Carter may request copies of any documents relating to his
            Equivalent SRIP benefit by writing to:

                           Vice President-Compensation
                           175 East Houston
                           San Antonio, Texas  78205

            In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes
            duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of
            employee benefit plans. The people who operate a plan, called
            "fiduciaries" of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the
            interest of plan participants. No one may fire Mr. Carter or
            otherwise discriminate against Mr. Carter in any way to prevent Mr.
            Carter from obtaining a benefit or exercising Mr. Carter's rights
            under ERISA.

            If a claim for Equivalent SRIP benefits under this Agreement is
            denied, in whole or in part, Mr. Carter must receive a written
            explanation of the reason for denial, and Mr. Carter has a right to
            have Mr. Carter's claim reviewed and reconsidered.

            Under ERISA, there are steps Mr. Carter can take to enforce Mr.
            Carter's right to his Equivalent SRIP. For instance, if Mr. Carter
            requests materials to which Mr. Carter is entitled pursuant to this
            Agreement relating to his Equivalent SRIP benefit and does not
            receive them within 30 days, Mr. Carter may file suit in a federal
            court. In such a case, the court may require the Company to provide
            the materials and pay Mr. Carter up to $110.00 a day until Mr.
            Carter receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent
            because of reasons beyond the control of the Company. If Mr. Carter
            has a claim for Equivalent SRIP benefits that is denied or deemed
            denied, in whole or in part, Mr. Carter may file suit in a state or
            federal court. If Mr. Carter is discriminated against for asserting
            Mr. Carter's rights under ERISA, Mr. Carter may seek assistance from
            the U.S. Department of Labor, or Mr. Carter may file suit in a
            federal court. The court will decide who will pay court costs and
            legal fees. If Mr. Carter is successful, the court may order the
            Company to pay these costs and fees. If Mr. Carter loses, the court
            may order Mr. Carter to pay the costs and fees, for example, if it
            finds the claim is frivolous.

            If Mr. Carter has any questions about this statement or about Mr.
            Carter's rights under ERISA, Mr. Carter should contact the nearest
            Area Office of the Labor Management Services Administration, U.S.
            Department of Labor.

      15. The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement that by their
sense and context are intended to survive the termination or completion of
performance of obligations by either or both parties under this Agreement shall
so survive.

      16. This Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein shall not
be modified or amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing executed and
delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

      17. Except as provided in Paragraph 4 regarding benefits that shall be
provided in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of benefit
plans as they apply to Mr. Carter, this Agreement and the Release and Waiver
contained herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and the Release and Wavier
contained herein may be signed in multiple counterparts, each, when taken
together, shall constitute a single agreement.

      18. In the event any provision of this Agreement or the Release and Waiver
contained herein is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not
affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of any other provision of this
Agreement or said Release and Waiver, except that should Mr. Carter assert in
any legal proceeding that any of the provisions of Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 or 9 of
this Agreement are invalid, void, or unenforceable as a matter of law, or should

assert in any legal proceeding that the Release and Waiver is invalid,
unenforceable or void as a matter of law, then this Agreement and the Release
and Waiver contained herein, at the Company's option, may be declared by the
Company null and void. If this Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained
herein are declared null and void by the Company pursuant to the provisions of
this Paragraph 18, Mr. Carter shall return to Company all consideration
previously received pursuant to Paragraph 2 of this Agreement and the Release
and Waiver contained herein less any of said consideration Mr. Carter would have
received in the absence of entering into this Agreement and the Release and
Waiver contained herein. This Paragraph 18 does not restrict Mr. Carter from
asserting (whether as a claim or a defense to a claim) that his actual or
proposed activities or conduct do not violate the terms of Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 or
9 or do not violate the terms of the Release and Waiver, and the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise its rights under this Paragraph 18 as a result of
any such assertion or as a result of a finding or ruling by a court in favor of
Mr. Carter that his conduct or activities do not violate the applicable
provisions of Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 or 9 or the Release and Waiver (even if said
court shall also rule in the absence of an assertion by Mr. Carter that any of
such provisions, or the Release and Waiver, are invalid, unenforceable or void
as a matter of law).

      19. This Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon, the Company, BellSouth, SBC and their
respective successors and assigns, and Mr. Carter and Mr. Carter's beneficiaries
under the various employee benefit programs.

      20. This Agreement and the Release and Waiver contained herein shall be
and hereby is declared to be null and void in the event that Mr. Carter does not
terminate his employment relationship with the Company at the close of business
on December 30, 2002. All payments and other consideration to be provided to Mr.
Carter by Company are contingent upon Mr. Carter's termination of employment
actually becoming effective at the close of business on December 30, 2002, and
are further contingent upon Mr. Carter's execution at the close of business on
December 30, 2002, of the Release and Waiver contained herein and not revoking
same and Mr. Carter's execution of this Agreement on or before the close of
business on December 30, 2002, and not revoking same.
