                            ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of May 15, 2002 by and between IVAX Diagnostics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("IVD"), and Sigma Diagnostics, Inc., a Missouri corporation ("Sigma") (each a
"Party" and together the "Parties").

                                    RECITALS

     A.   Sigma, among many other activities, is a distributor of certain

instruments, all of which are fully listed on the attached Schedule 1.0
(collectively, the products listed on such schedule, to the extent so
distributed by Sigma on the date hereof, are hereinafter referred to as the "EIA
Product Line").

     B.   IVD desires to terminate the distribution relationship with Sigma and
to purchase certain assets used in, and to assume certain liabilities associated
with, Sigma's distribution of the EIA Product Line; and Sigma desires to sell
such assets and assign such liabilities to IVD, all on the following terms and
conditions.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties, conditions and agreements hereinafter expressed,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

     1.2  ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS

     On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, IVD shall

included within the definition of "Assumed Liabilities." For purposes of this
Agreement, an "Affiliate" of a specified person (the "Specified Person") shall
be any person who directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with the Specified Person. For the purposes of this definition,
the term "control" means (y) beneficial ownership of at least fifty percent
(50%) of an entity's voting securities or equity interests or (z) a fifty
percent (50%) or greater interest in the net assets or profits of an entity.

     1.3  PURCHASE PRICE

     1.8  DELIVERY OF INVENTORY; GUARANTEED INVENTORY

          (a)  Delivery of the Inventory and the Customer Leased Instruments is
effected by execution of this Agreement and all title and risk of loss transfer
as of the Closing Date. The Inventory is to be held by Sigma at Sigma's places
of business where such items of Inventory are currently located at the cost and
risk of IVD pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. The
Customer Leased Instruments are delivered where located at the respective
customer facility. All tangible Assets other than the Inventory and the Customer
Leased Instruments will either (1) be delivered to IVD per IVD's instruction at
Closing and all title and risk of loss transfer as of the Closing Date, or (2)
remain where currently located to be held by Sigma at IVD's cost and risk
pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

          (b)  On the Closing Date, Sigma shall provide IVD with the following
reports, each generated within two business days prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Reports"):

          (i)  a detailed list of all Inventory other than the Guaranteed
Inventory and the Parts Inventory, each as defined below, together with a value
assigned by Sigma to each item of inventory and an extension of total value for
each item (the "Main Inventory Report");

          (ii) a detailed list of the kits and reagents described on the
attached Schedule 1.8(a)(ii)(A) to the extent included in the Inventory and
meeting the criteria set forth below (the "Guaranteed Inventory"), which list
shall include the per item value allocable to each such item as previously
agreed between the Parties and an extension of total value for each item (the
"Guaranteed Inventory Report"). For purposes of memorializing the procedures
which have been performed prior to execution of this Agreement, the items which
have been designated Guaranteed Inventory have been determined as follows: the
post-closing projected inventory turnover rates for kits and reagents, based on
2001 and 2002 actual sales of Sigma, have been agreed by IVD and Sigma and are
set forth on the attached Schedule 1.8(a)(ii)(B); then actual Closing Date kits
and reagents Inventory (which has not changed since compiled two business days
prior to the Closing Date) has been compared to such projected turnover rates on
a first in first out basis; and finally all kits and reagents Inventory having a
remaining shelf life of less than 3 months at the date on which such Inventory
is expected to be sold under the foregoing analysis have been written off, the
remainder has been considered Guaranteed Inventory and the value thereof has
been agreed by Sigma and IVD; and

          (iii) a general description of all spare parts and consumables ("Spare
Parts") included in the Inventory (the "Spare Parts Report") which, for purposes
of this Agreement, shall be allocated a value of $0.

          (c)  IVD shall have, prior to the Closing Date, completed its
inspection of the Inventory. IVD's execution of this Agreement shall constitute
acceptance of the Inventory, and IVD shall have no further claims against Sigma
in respect of delivery of the Inventory.

     2.1  POWER AND AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION

          (a)  Sigma is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri. Sigma, or its respective
Affiliate, has full corporate power and authority to enter into the Transaction
Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by Sigma have

other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and equitable
principles of general applicability.

          (b)  The execution, delivery and performance by Sigma of the
Transaction Documents and the consummation by Sigma of the transactions
contemplated thereby do not and will not, except for any such matters that do
not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the Assets taken as a whole (i) contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Sigma, or any of the
Assets or Sigma's articles of incorporation or bylaws or (ii) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the Assets. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.1(b) and except for any consent required by the Assumed Contracts, no
waiver or consent of any third person is required for the execution of the
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, except for such waivers or consents the failure of which to obtain
would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
Assets taken as a whole.

     2.2  ASSETS

     With the exception of the intellectual property assigned pursuant to the
Trademark Assignment, Sigma has good title to the Assets, free and clear of all
Liens, and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, IVD will

may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Assets or
the Assumed

                                        6

Liabilities after the Closing Date. To Sigma's Knowledge, no such judgment,
order, decree or award has been entered against Sigma nor has any liability been
incurred which has, or may reasonably be expected to have, such effect. To
Sigma's Knowledge, there is no material claim, action or proceeding now pending
before any court, grand jury, administrative or regulatory body, government

reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

principles applied on a consistent basis, has since January 1, 2002, either: (a)
notified Sigma in writing of its intent to discontinue its relationship with
Sigma; or (b) returned a Customer Leased Instrument to Sigma without ordering a
replacement. To Sigma's Knowledge, other than as listed on Schedule 2.4, no
Sigma Supplier from whom Sigma's purchases in respect of the EIA Product Line

forth in this Agreement. Copies of all documents containing material terms of
the Assumed Contracts, as such terms existed as of December 31, 2001, have been
delivered by Sigma to IVD. To Sigma's Knowledge, Sigma is not in material breach
or default under any of the Assumed Contracts.

     2.7  TRADEMARKS

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the rules and regulations under
either such Act, or any other applicable law, or rule or regulation of any
applicable securities exchange, in which case, the Party will also provide
advance notice to the other Party

                                       10

<PAGE>

of such proposed disclosure within a reasonable time period permitting such
other Party to respond thereto; (ii) such disclosure is legally compelled by
judicial or administrative order, deposition, interrogatory, request for
documents, subpoena, investigative demand or other process or otherwise; or
(iii) such disclosure is the result of proper financial statement preparation
and publication, including compliance with the requirement that Sigma report it
has disposed of certain EIA Product Line assets and to quantify the related
loss.

     4.4  EMPLOYEES

          (a)  IVD shall make post-Closing offers of employment to the employees
of Sigma set forth on Schedule 4.4, (such employees, if accepting IVD's offer,
the "Employees" and such offers, if accepted by the employee, the "Employment
Agreements"). All remaining employees of Sigma and its Affiliates shall continue
to be subject to the protections of the Confidentiality Agreement signed by the
Parties as of December 24, 2001, and except as provided herein, IVD shall not
directly or indirectly hire or solicit to hire any such employees of Sigma or
its Affiliates other than the Employees or induce or encourage any such other
employee to terminate his or her association with Sigma. Should IVD hire any
employee of Sigma, without Sigma's prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, other than the Employees, within 36 months following the
Closing, IVD shall reimburse Sigma for the amount of any severance payments made
by Sigma in respect of the termination of such employee's employment in
connection with the sale of the Assets to IVD. Sigma shall not have any
responsibility for ensuring IVD's ability to hire any employees to whom IVD has
made offers nor for the terms of any of the Employment Agreements with such
persons.

          (b)  IVD will have sole responsibility for any obligations or
liabilities to the Employees accepting offers of Employment Agreements that
arise from all wages, benefits and other compensation, all severance obligations
and all required ancillary payments of taxes, insurance and related social
requirements, to the extent for services rendered on or after the Closing Date.
Such liabilities of IVD are part of the "Assumed Liabilities" defined in Section
1.2 of this Agreement.

          (c)  Sigma shall retain all liabilities for wages, benefits and other
compensation and/or required ancillary payments of Taxes, insurance and related
social requirements (including all severance and other employment related
payments related to the EIA Product Line through the day of Closing), (i) in
respect to the services rendered prior to the Closing Date by the Employees
accepting the Employment Agreements, and (ii) with respect to services rendered
at any time by all employees other than those accepting the Employment
Agreements. Such liabilities of Sigma are part of the "Retained Liabilities"
defined in Section 1.2 of this Agreement.

     4.5  NONCOMPETITION AND CONFIDENTIALITY

     In consideration of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby:

          (a)  Sigma shall not, for a period of three (3) consecutive years from
the Closing Date, (i) directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, through any
Affiliate or other

                                       11

<PAGE>

entity, as a principal, partner, agent or otherwise, compete, assist in or
provide financial resources to any activity which directly manufactures or sells
any products contained in the EIA Product Line or products or services in the
in-vitro diagnostic enzyme immunoassay business regulated by the FDA; or (ii)
directly or indirectly solicit, encourage to leave employment, or hire any of
the former employees hired by IVD pursuant to the Employment Agreements;
provided, however, that such restrictions shall not apply to any such employee
who responds to a general solicitation for employment with Sigma, including any
employee responding to an advertisement for employment in a newspaper, trade
journal or web site, regardless of whether such solicitation is made by Sigma or
through a third party; or (iii) solely with respect to activities concerned with
sales of the EIA Product Line, directly or indirectly sell, solicit for sale, or
call on for purposes of selling, any customer contained on the Customer Lists
(it being expressly acknowledged by IVD that Sigma may call upon such customers
for all other purposes).

          (b)  Sigma shall not, for a period of two (2) consecutive years from
the Closing Date, use or disclose to anyone except authorized personnel of IVD,
whether or not for its benefit or otherwise, any confidential matters which both
solely concern the EIA Product Line and are of a nature that Sigma has
maintained as confidential during its ownership of the EIA Product Line, as
described in Schedule 4.5(b) (the "Confidential Information"); provided that
"Confidential Information" shall not include any information that is used, or is
expected to be used, in Sigma's or its Affiliates' other areas of business other
than the EIA Product Line. The preceding obligations to maintain such
Confidential Information in confidence shall not apply to the extent that (i)
the information is or becomes in the future public knowledge through no fault or
omission of Sigma, or (ii) the information is required to be disclosed by law.

          (c)  Sigma acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions in subsections
(a) and (b) above are reasonable and agrees that in the event of any breach
thereof the harm to IVD will be irreparable and without adequate remedy at law,
and therefore that injunctive relief with respect thereto will be appropriate.
To the extent that any provision of this Section 4.5 is adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable because it is overbroad, that provision shall not be
void but rather shall be limited only to the extent required by applicable law
and enforced as so limited.

     4.6  TERMINATION OF DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENT

     As of the Closing, the Distributorship Agreement by and between IVD and
Sigma effective as of May 1, 1999, the Distributorship Agreement between IVD and
Sigma effective as of October 1, 2000, and all related rights and obligations
under each of the foregoing agreements shall terminate.

     4.7  SUPPLY OF REAGENT UNDER WARRANTY TO CUSTOMERS

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.2 above, IVD shall supply to
all previous customers of Sigma, with respect to sales of reagents prior to the
Closing, any replacement reagent which any such customer has demanded and which
the original supplier of reagent to Sigma has an obligation or is otherwise
willing to supply. IVD shall use its best efforts to satisfy any such customer
complaints with respect to sales prior to Closing by seeking to arrange for the
supply of

                                       12

<PAGE>

replacement reagents at such supplier's cost. In the event that no such reagent
is provided by the supplier at its cost, despite IVD's best efforts, then IVD
shall sell such replacement reagent to Sigma at IVD's cost. Notwithstanding the
foregoing covenant, IVD assumes no direct liability to such customers for sales
of reagents by Sigma prior to Closing.

     4.8  LIMITED USE OF SIGMA TRADEMARK.

     Sigma has agreed to permit IVD limited rights to use the "Sigma" brand name
in connection with the resale of the EIA Product Line Inventory which IVD
acquires hereunder, for a period not to exceed: the earlier of (a) two years or
(b) the remaining shelf life of the Inventory (which shall be included in the
indemnification by IVD of Sigma pursuant to Section 5.1). Promptly upon the
expiration of the applicable license period, IVD shall cease all sale or other
transfer of Inventory, Records and any other Assets on which the "Sigma" brand
name may appear, and no later than 30 days thereafter IVD shall complete removal
of any and all use and indication of the "Sigma" name from the Inventory, the
Records and any other Assets remaining in its possession. With respect to
instruments contained in the Inventory that are already installed at customer
locations, IVD shall remove or "sticker-over" the "Sigma" brand name from such
products within 8 months from the Closing.

                                    ARTICLE V
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     5.1  INDEMNIFICATION BY IVD

     From and after the Closing Date, IVD shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Sigma and its Affiliates and shareholders and each of their employees,
officers, directors and agents from and against any and all claims, losses,
arbitration and court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, demands, causes of
action, suits, judgments, debts, liabilities and expenses, including arbitration
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in establishing the right to
indemnification (collectively referred to for purposes of this Article V as a
"Claim") in any tribunal, domestic or foreign, resulting from (a) any failure of
IVD promptly to carry out, perform, satisfy and discharge any of its covenants,
agreements, undertakings, liabilities or obligations under any of the
Transaction Documents, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty by IVD
contained herein, (c) IVD's ownership or use of the Assets after the Closing, or
(d) any obligation or liability arising from the Assumed Liabilities.

     5.2  INDEMNIFICATION BY SIGMA

          (a)  From and after the Closing Date, Sigma shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless IVD and its Affiliates and shareholders and each of their
employees, officers, directors and agents from and against any and all Claims
resulting from or arising out of (i) any failure of Sigma promptly to carry out,
perform, satisfy and discharge any of its covenants, agreements, undertakings,
obligations or liabilities under any of the Transaction Documents, or (ii) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Sigma contained herein, (iii) the
failure of Sigma to assume responsibility for any Retained Liability, (iv) any
failure to comply with any "bulk sales," "bulk

                                       13

<PAGE>

transfer" or similar laws other than to the extent such Claims are Assumed
Liabilities; or (v) as provided in Section 5.2(b) hereof.

          (b)  Sigma shall indemnify IVD in the manner and by the amount listed
below, for each Customer Leased Instrument and each Third-Party Leased
Instrument returned by existing Sigma customers, in both instances only if such
return is fully consummated during the 12 months immediately following Closing
and the criteria set forth in (A) or (B) have been met:

                    (A)  The amount of such Claim for indemnification shall be
equal to $10,000 if and only if each of the following conditions have been met:
(1) IVD has lost the customer due to factors caused by Sigma's handling of the
account pre-Closing; (2) IVD has used its best efforts since Closing to retain
the customer, including without limitation the provision of appropriate levels
of field services and technical support for all in-place instruments; and (3)
the returned instrument has not been nor is reasonably expected to be replaced
by another instrument from IVD; or

                    (B)  The amount of such Claim for indemnification shall be
equal to $5,000 if and only if each of the following conditions has been met:
(1) IVD has not lost the customer due to factors caused by Sigma's handling of
the account pre-closing; (2) IVD has used its best efforts since Closing to
retain the customer, including without limitation the provision of appropriate
levels of field services and technical support for all in-place instruments; and
(3) the returned instrument has not been nor is reasonably expected to be
replaced by another instrument from IVD.

     Any Claims under this Section 5.2(b) are subject to being offset by a
$10,000 credit in Sigma's favor for each new Customer Leased Instrument or new
Third-Party Leased Instrument delivered to a customer by Sigma in the time
period from March 1, 2002 through Closing. The foregoing shall be IVD's sole
recourse against Sigma for any and all Claims relating to the return of any
Customer Leased Instruments. Each new Customer Leased Instrument or new
Third-Party Leased Instrument delivered to a customer by Sigma in the time
period from March 1, 2002 through Closing is identified as such on Schedule
1.1(b).

          (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sigma shall not be required to
indemnify any party under subsections (i), (ii) or (v) of Section 5.2(a) or
Section 5.2(b), unless and until the aggregate amount of all Claims exceeds Six
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000) (the "Deductible"), and then only to
the extent of amounts in excess of the Deductible. Further, in no event shall
Sigma's aggregate indemnification obligation under subsections (i), (ii) or (v)
of Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b) exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($350,000).

     5.3  INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES

     Promptly after acquiring knowledge of any Claim against which a Party
entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") may seek
indemnification against the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") pursuant to
this Article V, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that failure to provide such notice will

                                       14

<PAGE>

not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party under this Agreement unless (a) the Indemnified Party fails to
give written notice to the Indemnifying Party within forty (40) days of the date
the Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of such Claim or (b) the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. To the extent that the Claim
consists of a claim, suit or action by a third party (an "Action"), the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Action and, to the extent that it so elects by written notice to the Indemnified
Party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Party,
to assume control of such defense; provided however, that (y) the Indemnified
Party shall at its own expense be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Action and to employ separate counsel and (z) the Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
to each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such
Action. After written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of its election to assume control of the defense of any such Action, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof.

     5.4  COMPUTATION OF CLAIMS

     All computations of Claims and the amount of indemnification to which any
Indemnified Party is entitled under this Article V shall be made after deduction
of all proceeds of insurance (net of retroactive premiums and self-insurance
retention) recoverable by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claims.

     5.5  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

     The Parties agree that the provisions of this Article V set forth the
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties after the Closing with respect to
any Claims under any of the Transaction Documents.

     5.6  SETOFF

     IVD shall not be entitled to set off any amounts owing by Sigma to IVD or
any party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.2, as an Indemnified
Party or otherwise, against any amounts owed to Sigma pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, except to the extent that such amounts owing by Sigma are
owing pursuant to a binding judgment or arbitration award.

     5.7  EXPIRATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     All of the representations and warranties contained in Articles II and III
hereof are made only as of the Closing Date and shall survive Closing only for
purposes of indemnification under this Article V for a period of twelve (12)
months from the Closing Date. All other obligations under this Agreement shall
expire according to their terms.

                                       15

<PAGE>

     5.8  KNOWLEDGE OF BREACH

     If, as of Closing, IVD has actual knowledge of any fact, circumstance or
situation which constitutes a breach, or if known to Sigma would constitute such
a breach, or will with the passage of time or the giving of notice constitute a
breach, of any representation, warranty or covenant of Sigma hereunder or a
failure of any conditions to IVD's obligations under this Agreement or the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and IVD has not given Sigma prompt notice thereof
prior to Closing, IVD shall be precluded from seeking indemnification with
respect to such breach under this Article V.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     6.1  Arbitration

     Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.5(c) or in this Section 6.1, in
the event of any controversy or claim arising under or in relation to this
Agreement, including any issue about payment of amounts due, the Parties shall,
in good faith, attempt to resolve the controversy or claim by negotiation. If
the controversy or claim cannot be resolved within sixty (60) days, then it
shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and shall be
held in Atlanta, Georgia. There shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected by
the Party who requests arbitration, who shall notify the other Party of the
individual selected at the time that notice of arbitration is sent; one selected
by the other Party within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of arbitration; and
one selected by the Parties jointly within ten (10) calendar days thereafter or,
failing their agreement, selected pursuant to the rules of the AAA. No
arbitrator shall be related to, employed by, or have at any time a substantial
ongoing business relationship with any Party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates. The losing Party in the arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing
Party for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred
in connection with the arbitration. The decision of the arbitrators shall be
final and binding on the Parties and judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The provisions of
this arbitration clause shall not be applied to the determination of questions
affecting validity or scope of any patents, trademarks or other intellectual
property rights.

     6.2  ALLOCATION OF TAXES AND CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES

          (a)  For any personal property, ad valorem and any other similar local
or state taxes relating solely to the Assets or the EIA Product Line for any
taxable year or period commencing prior to the Closing and ending on or after
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period "), Sigma shall pay to IVD within fifteen
(15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an
amount that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending immediately
prior to the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not paid by Sigma prior
to Closing. For purposes of this Section, the portion of such Tax that is
allocated to Sigma shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the taxable period ending immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period. Any
credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends on or after the
Closing Date shall be allocated in a similar manner, with the entire credit
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days prior to
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire taxable period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocations described in this Section shall be made in a manner consistent with
the prior practice of Sigma, except for changes required by changes in law or
fact.

          (b)  IVD shall assume and pay all liabilities for sales, use,
transfer, value-added and other Taxes arising from the transfer of the Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities to IVD and all fees and expenses related to the
recordation of assignments against the intellectual property rights set forth in
the Trademark Assignment. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the
Parties shall pay all costs and expenses incurred on its behalf in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
