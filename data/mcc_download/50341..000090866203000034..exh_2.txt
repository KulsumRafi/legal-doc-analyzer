on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the
Person in whose name this Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor  Senior Notes)
is  registered  at the close of business  on the first day of  February  and the
first day of August, respectively, in each year; provided, however, that in case

is registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date for the payment
of such Defaulted  Interest to be fixed by the Trustee,  notice whereof shall be
given to Holders of Senior  Notes of this  series not less than 10 days prior to
such Special  Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent  with the  requirements  of any  securities  exchange  on which the
Senior  Notes of this  series  may be  listed,  and upon  such  notice as may be
required  by  such  exchange,  all as more  fully  provided  in said  Indenture.
Interest  will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year  consisting  of twelve

waiver by the Holder of this Senior Note shall be  conclusive  and binding  upon
such  Holder and upon all future  Holders of this  Senior Note and of any Senior
Notes issued upon the  registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or
in lieu hereof  whether or not  notation of such  consent or waiver is made upon
