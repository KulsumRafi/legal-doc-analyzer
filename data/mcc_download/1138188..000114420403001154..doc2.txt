2.1 The parties agree that Section 2.1 of the Purchase Agreement shall be

2.1  Purchase and Sale.
-----------------------

     (a)  Subject  to all the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  at the
          Closing,   Sub  shall   purchase  from  the   Shareholders,   and  the
          Shareholders  shall sell to Sub, an aggregate of 21,100,000  shares of
          the  common  stock in the  capital  of  Seller  (the  "SCIAX  SHARES")
          beneficially owned by the Shareholders. In consideration, Buyer or Sub
          shall deliver to the  Shareholders  for each Sciax Share  beneficially
          owned by the  Shareholder  immediately  before the Closing  0.90521327
          (calculated  as  21,100,000  divided into  19,100,000)  voting  common
          shares of Buyer ("BUYER COMMON SHARES").

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Ken  Smart,  a  Shareholder,  shall,
          instead of Buyer Common Shares, exchange each Sciax Share beneficially
          owned by Ken Smart  immediately  before the  Closing  for  0.226303317
          (calculated as 21,100,000  divided into  4,775,000)  voting  preferred
          shares of Buyer  ("PREFERRED  SHARES") and  0.90521327  (calculated as
          21,100,000  divided  into  19,100,000)  exchangeable  shares of Seller
          ("EXCHANGEABLE SHARES") exchangeable into Buyer Common Shares.

     (c)  The parties acknowledge that the aggregate number of Preferred Shares,
          Buyer Common Shares and  Exchangeable  Shares to be issued shall be as
          set out in  Schedule  3.3 hereof and that each  Preferred  Share shall
          carry  four  votes for every one Buyer  Common  Share.  The  Preferred
          Shares,  Exchangeable Shares and Buyer Common Shares shall hereinafter
          be referred to as the "SHARE CONSIDERATION".

2.2 The  parties  hereto  agree  that the  Purchase  Agreement  shall be further
amended as follows:

     (a)  Section 2.2(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
          following:


                                       2
<PAGE>

               Two (2) promissory  notes  ("Notes")  issued on Closing by Buyer,
               one to Aldo Rotondi  and/or Airam  Capital Group in the amount of
               US$175,000  and one to Stephen  Brock  and/or  Nevada Fund in the
               amount  of  US$175,000  to  satisfy  debts  and   obligations  of
               Ugomedia,  including  funds advanced by Aldo Rotondi and/or Airam
               Capital  Group and Stephen  Brock and/or Nevada Fund to the Buyer
               and  redemption  proceeds  owing by the Buyer to Aldo Rotondi and
               Nevada Fund pursuant to the  redemption  set forth in Section 7.4
               of the Purchase  Agreement.  The Notes shall bear interest at the
               rate of 6% simple  interest per annum.  The Notes shall be repaid
               on  the  first  anniversary  of  the  Closing  Date,  subject  to
               prepayment  in whole or in part at any time  without  premium  or
               penalty.  The Notes  shall be  secured  by the  guarantee  of the
               Seller. Buyer agrees to provide  satisfactory  evidence to Seller
               prior to Closing of the  amounts  owing to Aldo  Rotondi or Airim
               Capital  Group and Stephen  Brock or Nevada Fund.  Holders of the
               Notes  shall have the option at any time prior to the due date so
               long as there is no default to convert all unpaid  principal  and
               accrued  interest  into common  shares of stock of Buyer  ("Buyer
               Common Stock") at the rate of US$0.20 per share.  This option may
               be  exercised  in whole or in part at any time prior to repayment
               of the Notes. If there is a default in the Notes, then holders of
               the  Notes  shall  have the  option  at any time the Notes are in
               default to convert all unpaid principal and accrued interest into
               shares of stock of Buyer at the lower of (i)  US$0.20  per share;
               and (ii) the average  trading price of the Buyer Common Stock for
               the twenty (20) day period  immediately  prior to the date of the
               option  exercise  notice  from the  holders.  This  option may be
               exercised  in  whole  or in part at any  time  the  Notes  are in
               default.  Further,  to the extent any shares are  acquired  under
               this  option,  the  owners  of  these  shares  if the  option  is
               exercised  collectively,  shall  have a one time right to require
               that Buyer  register the shares for resale within 90 days of such
               request on a  registration  statement  filed with the  Securities
               Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and kept  effective  until all such
               shares are resold, all at Buyer's expense.

     (b)  The second sentence of Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby
          deleted  in its  entirety  and  replace  with  the  following:  "Buyer
          undertakes  to obtain the necessary  shareholder  consent for the Name
          Change."

     (c)  Section  2.5 of the  Purchase  Agreement  shall be amended to refer to
          "consulting agreements" instead of "employment agreements".

     (d)  Section  2.8  of the  Purchase  Agreement  is  hereby  deleted  in its
          entirety and replaced with the following:

               2.8 OSC Order. If necessary,  Buyer shall,  following the Closing
               Date, use its best efforts to cause its legal counsel to apply to
               the  Ontario  Securities  Commission  for a  ruling  pursuant  to
               subsection  74(1) of the  Securities  Act (Ontario) to permit the
               distribution  of the Share  Consideration  without  a  prospectus
               being filed under the Securities Act (Ontario).

          property of Sciax at fair market value in the event of the sale of the

          in  consideration  for the promissory note described in Section 2.2(b)
          and the Nevada Fund shall have returned to treasury  1,367,323  shares
          in consideration for the promissory note described in Section 2.2(b)".

or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,  indenture,  deed of trust,  license,
contract,  lease,  agreement,  arrangement or other  instrument or obligation to
