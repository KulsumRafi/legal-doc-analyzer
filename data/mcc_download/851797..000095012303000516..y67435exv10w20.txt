                 (c)  The issuance of certificates evidencing the Converted
Shares upon surrender of the Converting Shares shall be made without charge to
the Converting Stockholders for any issue tax in respect thereof, or other cost

that the Issuer shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in
respect of any transfer involving the issue and delivery of any certificate in
a name other than that of the holder or former holder of the Converting Shares.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                 The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to each Converting
Stockholder as follows:

                  SECTION 3.1  Organization and Status.  The Issuer is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to
transact business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its business
makes such qualification necessary, except where such failure to qualify would
not have a Material Adverse Effect and the Issuer has all requisite corporate
power and authority and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to own, lease and operate its property and
assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged.

                  SECTION 3.2.  Authorization.  (a)  The Issuer has the
requisite corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

                 (b)  The Converted Shares have been duly authorized and, when
issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have
been validly issued and will be fully paid and nonassessable, and free and
clear of any Lien or other right or claim, except to the extent set forth in
the Restated Stockholders Agreement dated September 2, 1994 among the Issuer
and certain Stockholders of the Issuer (the "Stockholder Agreement"), and each
Converting Stockholder will acquire good and valid title to the Converted
Shares to be obtained by it free of any Lien and free of any other limitation
or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such Converted Shares), except as provided in the
Stockholders Agreement and the Issuer's Certificate of Incorporation.  The
issuance of the Converted Shares is not subject to any preemptive or similar
rights which have not been satisfied or waived, and holders of the Converted
Shares will not be entitled to any preemptive or similar rights, except as set
forth in the Issuer's Certificate of Incorporation and in the Stockholders
Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.3.  No Violation; Consents.  The execution,
delivery and performance by the Issuer of this Agreement will not (i)
contravene any applicable provision of any law, statute, rule, regulation,
order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality
by which the Issuer is bound, (ii) conflict with or constitute a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination or acceleration under any indenture,
loan agreement, contract, lease or other agreement to which the Issuer is a
party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or to which it
may be subject, or (iii) violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Issuer.  No consent, authorization or order of,
or filing or





                                       3

registration with, any court or governmental department, agency or authority is
required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Issuer.

                  SECTION 3.4.  Offer or Sale of Securities.  Neither the
Issuer nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered or sold or will offer or
sell any securities or has taken any other action that would subject this
securities conversion to the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.



                                   ARTICLE IV

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 4.1.  Applicability of the Purchase Agreement. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Converted Shares obtained
hereunder shall be subject to all the terms, conditions and provisions relating
to transfer restrictions contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement dated
as of April 27, 1989 among the Issuer, BLS and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.
(formerly known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.) and to all of the
provisions of the Stockholders Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.2.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).
