reason Bank cannot avail itself of the courts of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, then venue shall lie in Santa Clara County, California.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE BANK SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTY IN THE COURTS Of ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION WHICH THE BANK DEEMS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE

OR ITS PROPERTY.
