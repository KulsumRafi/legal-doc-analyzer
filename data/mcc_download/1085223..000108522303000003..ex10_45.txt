                          GENERAL PROVISIONS AGREEMENT


ARTICLE 1:     PARTIES AND BACKGROUND

1.1 Parties to Agreement. This General Provisions Agreement (the "GP Agreement")
    --------------------
is entered into by Tele Atlas North America, Inc., a California corporation
located at 1605 Adams Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA, ("TANA") and Switchboard
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation located at 120 Flanders Road, Westboro, MA
01581-5013, USA, ("Licensee").

The Parties have agreed upon the following:

1.2 Background. TANA develops and distributes spatial map data products and
    ----------
related materials. This GP Agreement states the general terms and conditions
applicable to any licenses granted to the products specified ("Licensed
Products") in a separate license agreement(s) (the "License"). The specific
licensing fees, royalties and/or other payments due to TANA for the license of
the Licensed Products shall be as set forth in such License(s). This GP
Agreement and any Licenses shall be collectively referred to herein as the
"Agreements."

ARTICLE 2: RIGHTS

2.1 Ownership. TANA reserves all rights in the Licensed Products not expressly
    ---------
granted to Licensee by the Agreements and the Agreements do not constitute a
transfer of any title or interest in the Licensed Products. If the Licensed
Products or any portion thereof are modified, merged, incorporated or combined
into any software, hardware, or other data, or are converted or translated into
another data format, they shall continue to be subject to the provisions of the
Agreements, and TANA retains ownership of all such Licensed Products and all
such portions; provided, that the software, hardware, database or other work of
authorship created by Licensee, and into which the Licensed Products are used,
incorporated or combined by Licensee or its designees shall be and remain the
sole and exclusive property of Licensee. Licensee shall only use the Licensed
Products as authorized by any License.

2.2 Copyrights and Duplication. The Licensed Products are copyrighted by TANA
    --------------------------
and, except as expressly authorized in a License, neither Licensee, Licensee's
agent(s) nor any other third party shall duplicate, copy or reproduce any
Licensed Products, or any portion thereof, except as necessary for support,
back-up and archival purposes. Licensee shall conspicuously display TANA's then
current copyright notice and logo as required in any License.


ARTICLE 3: PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

3.1 Protection of Licensed Products. The Licensed Products include confidential
    -------------------------------
and proprietary information and materials and may include trade secrets.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees to hold the Licensed Products in confidence and in
trust. Licensee may disclose relevant aspects of the Licensed Products to its
employees, agents or representatives with a need to know who have been advised
of this provision and who have entered into an agreement with Licensee
sufficient to enable Licensee to enforce this provision. Licensee agrees to take
reasonable steps to protect the Licensed Products from misappropriation or
misuse. 3.2 Duty to Assist. Licensee shall notify TANA immediately if Licensee
learns of any misappropriation, unauthorized use or public disclosure of the
Licensed Products, and shall cooperate with TANA's efforts to prevent such
misappropriation, misuse or public disclosure. In the event Licensee becomes
aware of any violation of any provision of Section 3.1 by any current or former
employee, agent, licensee or representative of Licensee, Licensee shall
immediately notify TANA and shall, at its expense, assist TANA in TANA's
enforcement of Section 3.1. 3.3 TANA agrees to hold in trust and confidence, and
take reasonable steps to protect from misappropriation or misuse, any
confidential or proprietary information of Licensee which TANA may receive in
connection with this Agreement.

ARTICLE 4: ORDERS AND PAYMENT TERMS

    -----------------------------
Products within the time frames specified in any License. Licensee is
responsible for all shipping, insurance and related charges, if any, incurred by

and conditions appearing on any purchase order or other document submitted by
Licensee are null and void.

4.3 Payment Terms. Net payment for Licensed Products delivered to Licensee by
    -------------
TANA and/or royalties due TANA is set forth in the License(s). TANA may refuse
to deliver, or may delay the delivery of, any Licensed Products on order or any
updates generally shipped by TANA to Licensee if Licensee becomes delinquent in
the payment of any of its obligations to TANA. All outstanding amounts that are
not paid when due shall bear interest at the maximum allowable statutory rate at
the time or twelve percent (12%) per annum, whichever is less. All charges under
this Agreement include all taxes, assessments, levies and fees imposed upon TANA
by any federal, foreign, state or local governmental authority, including but

not limited to taxes based upon or measured by TANA's net income, any gross
receipts tax, all franchise taxes based upon TANA's existence or its general
right to transact business, and any payroll or other employment tax for which
TANA is liable. There will be added to the fees set forth in the License(s) any
applicable sales, use, or value added tax, or any similar tax or assessment
imposed by or under the authority of any federal, state or local law, rule or
regulation, which are paid by or are payable by TANA. Licensee expressly
authorizes TANA to collect and remit such taxes as may be required by any
applicable laws, unless Licensee furnishes TANA with a valid exemption

ARTICLE 5: WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.

5.1 Warranty.
    --------

         (a) TANA warrants that the media containing the Licensed Products is

consideration Licensee paid TANA for the affected Licensed Products, prorated
over the term of the applicable License.

         (e) Sections 5.1(a) and 5.1(d) state TANA'S SOLE OBLIGATION and
Licensee's SOLE REMEDY in the case of the Licensed Products not satisfying any
warranty stated this Section 5.1.

5.2 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.1, THE LICENSED PRODUCTS ARE
    ----------
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS" AND TANA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY,
EFFECTIVENESS, COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, TITLE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TANA OR ANY OF ITS
AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY, AND LICENSEE IS NOT ENTITLED TO
RELY ON ANY SUCH ADVICE OR INFORMATION.

ARTICLE 6: INDEMNIFICATION

6.1 Indemnification by TANA.
    -----------------------

          a. TANA shall protect, defend (or, in TANA's discretion, settle),
indemnify and hold Licensee harmless from any and all third party claims,
demands, liabilities, obligations, damages, suits, judgments or settlements,
including reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, (collectively, "Claims") that
are asserted against Licensee to the extent that such Claims are based upon a
contention that the Licensed Products used within the scope of any License
infringe or misappropriate any copyrights, trade secrets, or trademarks of any
third party created by United States federal law or the law of any of the United
States, provided that: (i) Licensee notifies TANA promptly in writing of such
Claim in sufficient time to enable TANA to protect its interests without
prejudice, (ii) TANA has the sole right to control the defense and negotiation
of all Claims, and (iii) Licensee fully cooperates in TANA's defense of all
Claims at TANA's sole cost and expense for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

          b. TANA shall not have any liability under Section 6.1(a) to the
extent that any Claim in 6.1(a) is based upon (i) the use of the Licensed
Products in combination with other products not furnished or made by TANA,
provided that the Licensed Products alone are not the cause of such Claim; (ii)
the use of the Licensed Products in practicing any infringing process; or (iii)
the modification of the Licensed Products or any portion thereof by anyone other
than TANA, provided that the Licensed Products in unmodified form are not the
cause of such Claim.

          c. If TANA (1) believes the Licensed Products infringe or (2) if, as a
result of any Claim of infringement described in this Section 6.1(a), TANA is


                                       2
<PAGE>

enjoined from licensing or sublicensing any Licensed Product, or (3) Licensee is
enjoined from using any Licensed Product, or (4) if TANA believes that such
injunction or Claim is likely, TANA may in its sole discretion and expense (a)
procure the right for Licensee to continue to use said Licensed Product; (b)
replace or modify the Licensed Products so as to make them non-infringing; or,
if options (a) and (b) are not feasible, (c) terminate the applicable License(s)
and, if applicable, this GP Agreement and refund a portion of the consideration
Licensee paid TANA for the affected Licensed Products, prorated over the term of
the applicable License.

          d. Sections 6.1(a) through 6.1(c) state the entire and exclusive
obligation of TANA to Licensee for any Claim.

6.2 Indemnification by Licensee. Licensee shall protect, defend (or, in
    ---------------------------
Licensee's discretion, settle), indemnify and hold TANA harmless from any and
all claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, damages, suits, judgments or
settlements, including reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, (collectively,
"Liability") that arise out of or relate to: (i) Licensee's or Reseller's (as
defined in the License) breach of Articles 2 or 3 of this GP Agreement or breach
of any grant of license or sublicensing requirements of any License, or (ii) the
material act, neglect, omission or unperformed obligation of Licensee or
Reseller in the development, modification, use or distribution of the Licensed
Products or any derivative thereof, provided that the Liability for which
indemnification of TANA is sought is based upon such material act, neglect,
omission or unperformed obligation of Licensee or Reseller.

ARTICLE 7: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

         [**], IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL
MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LICENSE,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED TWO (2) TIMES THE AMOUNTS PAID TO
TANA BY LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LICENSE DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE
(12) MONTHS.

[**] NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE)

TANA's designees, and the extent to which such amounts have been paid. Any such

<PAGE>

       Unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 10.1, this GP Agreement
shall be effective on the date of the last signature below and shall continue in
force until the expiration of the last License at which time this GP Agreement
will expire automatically. Licensee does not have or acquire by execution of
this GP Agreement, by performance hereunder, or otherwise, any vested right with
respect to the Licensed Products or the renewal of any of the Agreements. If
TANA continues a business relationship with Licensee after termination or
non-renewal of any of the Agreements, such relationship shall not be construed
as a renewal or a waiver of termination, but such relationship shall be "at
will," terminable at any time with or without cause or notice by either party,
and all such transactions shall be governed by terms otherwise identical to the
relevant provisions of the Agreements.

ARTICLE 10: TERMINATION, EFFECTS THEREOF AND REMEDIES

10.1 Termination Events.
     ------------------

a. TANA may terminate the Agreements (i) with ten (10) days' notice and
opportunity to cure if Licensee violates any grant of license provision of any
License or Articles 2 or 3 of this GP Agreement or (ii) with thirty (30) days'
notice and opportunity to cure if Licensee commits a material breach of any
other provision of the Agreements or otherwise fails materially to fulfill any
of its obligations hereunder. Licensee may terminate the Agreements with thirty
(30) days' notice and opportunity to cure if TANA commits a material breach of
any provision of the Agreements or otherwise fails materially to fulfill any of
its obligations hereunder.

b. Either party may terminate the Agreements (provided, however, that if any
License remains in effect, this GP Agreement must remain in effect) immediately
upon written notice to the other party if such other party becomes insolvent,
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or if any process or proceeding of any
court is instituted against such party by attachment or levy or execution, in
insolvency or bankruptcy, or in receivership, or if any general assignment is
made or attempted to be made for the benefit of creditors by such party. If
either party ceases to conduct its normal course of business, such party shall
immediately notify the other party in writing and the Agreements shall
automatically terminate.

10.2 Survival. Termination of any of the Agreements for any reason shall not
     --------
relieve Licensee's obligations to make full payment for all amounts owed to
TANA. Notwithstanding Licensee's continuing payment obligations specified in
this Section 10.2, all royalties that Licensee owes to TANA under any License
shall cease to accrue upon termination of the License, provided that, after such
termination of the License, Licensee does not (a) use the Licensed Products, (b)
provide the Derivative Services (as defined in the License) to End Users (as
defined in the License) or (c) distribute to any third party any works that are
based upon or incorporate all or part of one or more Licensed Products. In
addition, Articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11 and Sections 8.2, 10.2, and 10.3 shall
survive any termination or expiration.

10.3 Return or Destruction of Information. Promptly upon termination or
     ------------------------------------
expiration of this GP Agreement and any or all Licenses, Licensee shall return
to TANA's Legal Department, or destroy, all copies of the affected Licensed
Products and other materials developed by or belonging to TANA which are in the
possession or control of Licensee and an officer of Licensee shall certify in
writing to TANA that all such materials have been returned to TANA or have been
destroyed.

     ---------------------------
contemporaneous agreements and understandings between the parties relating to
their subject matter and are the complete and exclusive statement of the terms
of their agreement. They may only be amended in a writing signed by both
parties. In the event of a conflict, the following shall be the order of
precedence: any Licenses and Exhibits or Attachments thereto, this GP Agreement.

     ---------------------------
relationship between TANA and Licensee shall be governed by and construed in

preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm, any dispute arising out of,
connected with or relating to any of the Agreements, whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be finally resolved exclusively by
arbitration conducted by a mutually agreeable arbitrator. To the greatest extent
practicable, the arbitrators shall be appointed from a pool of arbitrators who
are stated to have experience or expertise in the computer software industry.

Arbitration Act and shall occur in the venue of the Party not initiating the
arbitration. Any award made by the arbitration panel, however constituted, shall
be final, binding and conclusive on all parties for all purposes and judgment
may be entered thereon by any state or federal court having jurisdiction.

11.5 Notices. Except as provided in Section 11.3, any notice, request or demand
     -------
required to be given hereunder shall be in writing, and may be delivered in
person, by overnight courier, by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
or by facsimile confirmed by overnight courier. All notices shall be addressed
to the party and address set forth at the end of this GP Agreement, unless and
until a party provides written notice of a new address for receipt of notice.
All notices shall be deemed received when (i) received, or (ii) when delivery is
first attempted by the carrier at the address of record, whichever occurs first.
A copy of all notices to TANA shall also be sent to TANA Legal Department. A
copy of all notices to Licensee shall also be sent to Licensee's Legal
Department.

11.6 Relief. Licensee acknowledges that a breach by Licensee of its obligations
     ------
under the Agreements would cause TANA irreparable harm and, in the event
Licensee breaches or threatens to breach its obligations under the Agreements,
TANA shall be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief.

11.7 Severability. In the event that any provision or part of a provision of any
     ------------
of the Agreements is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such
provision or part shall be stricken from such Agreement and the remainder of
such Agreement shall be valid, legal, and enforceable to the maximum extent
possible. If any provision or part is stricken from such Agreement in accordance
with this Section 11.7, such provision or part shall be replaced, to the extent
possible, with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that is as similar in
tenor to the stricken provision as is possible.

11.8 No Waiver. No waiver of any obligation or right of either party shall be
     ---------
effective unless in writing, executed by the party against whom it is being
enforced. Any such waiver shall not preclude a party from exercising any other
right or later exercising the same right.

11.9 Assignment. The Agreements shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
     ----------
binding upon the parties and their respective successors, legal representatives
and permitted assigns, except that Licensee shall not assign or transfer any of

assignments or transfers shall apply to assignments or transfers by operation of
law, as well as by contract, merger or consolidation. Any attempted assignment
or transfer in derogation of this prohibition is void.

11.10 Force Majeure. Except for payments due to TANA from Licensee pursuant to
     --------------
any of the Agreements, neither party shall be liable for non-performance or
delays in performance hereunder if caused by factors beyond its reasonable
control.

11.11 Compliance with Export Laws. Licensee acknowledges and understands that
     ----------------------------
the Licensed Products may be subject to restrictions on export and agrees to
comply with any applicable export laws.

11.12 No Joint Relationship. Licensee and TANA are independent contractors and
     ----------------------
neither has, nor will represent that it has, any power to bind the other party,
or to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on
behalf of the other party or in the other party's name. None of the Agreements
shall be construed as constituting Licensee and TANA as employees, agents,
partners, joint venturers, franchisors or franchisees, or to create any other
form of legal association or arrangement which might impose liability upon TANA
or Licensee for any act or failure to act of the other.

11.13 Construction. By execution of any of the Agreements, the parties agree
     -------------
that neither party shall be deemed the author of such Agreements for the
purposes of interpretation.

11.14 Agreement Confidentiality and Marketing. Neither party shall discuss nor
     ----------------------------------------
disclose the contents or terms of any of the Agreements with any third party
except for purposes of review with Licensee's legal counsel or financial
advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee agrees that TANA may publicly
announce and list Licensee as a licensee of TANA. TANA likewise agrees that
Licensee may publicly announce the existence of its relationship with TANA.
