                  -------------

    2.  I am purchasing the Securities as principal and, on closing of the
        agreement of purchase and sale, I will be the beneficial owner of the
        Securities.

    3.  I [circle one] have/have not received an offering memorandum
        describing the Issuer and the Securities.

                has reviewed or passed on the merits of the Securities, AND

           (b)  there is no government or other insurance covering the
                Securities, AND

           (c)  I may lose all of my investment, AND

           (d)  there are restrictions on my ability to resell the

                Securities, AND

           (e)  I will not receive a prospectus that the British Columbia
                Securities Act (the "Act") would otherwise require be given to

                prospectus exemption, AND

           (f)  because I am not purchasing the Securities under a
                prospectus, I will not have the civil remedies that would

           (g)  the Issuer has advised me that it is using an exemption
                from the requirement to sell through a dealer registered under
                the Act, except purchases referred to in paragraph 5(g), and as
                a result I do not have the benefit of any protection that might
                have been available to me by having a dealer act on my behalf.

        5.  I also acknowledge that: [circle one]

        hereby is being made in reliance on an exemption from such registration
        requirement;

   (b)  it acknowledges that it has not purchased the Securities as a
