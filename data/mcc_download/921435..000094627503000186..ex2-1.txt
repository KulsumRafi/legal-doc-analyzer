                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered
into  as of  March  20,  2003,  by  and  between  FNB  CORPORATION,  a  Virginia
corporation  with its  principal  office  located  in  Christiansburg,  Virginia
("FNB"), and BEDFORD BANCSHARES, INC., a Virginia corporation with its principal
office located in Bedford, Virginia ("BBI").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS,  FNB and BBI (together,  the "Companies") desire to affiliate,
so that Bedford Federal Savings Bank ("Bedford  Federal") will be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FNB; and

         WHEREAS,  FNB and BBI have  agreed  to the  affiliation  of  their  two
companies  through a merger under  Virginia  law, as a result of which BBI would
merge with and into FNB and the shareholders of BBI will become  shareholders of
FNB, all as more specifically  provided in this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan"); and

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Companies each believe it is in
the best interests of their respective  corporations  and their  shareholders to
affiliate as provided herein and that the respective  shareholder  values of FNB
and BBI can be maximized over time through this affiliation; and

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Companies each believe that the
transaction  contemplated  in this  Agreement  is in the best  interests  of the
communities they serve and of their respective employees; and

         WHEREAS,  the Boards of  Directors of the  Companies  each believe that
after the affiliation the holding company  structure  should provide  management
and technical assistance and support for recruitment,  training and retention of
skilled  officers  and  employees  to their  affiliates  in order to enable  the
combined organization to operate more efficiently; and

         WHEREAS,  the  respective  Boards of  Directors of the  Companies  have
resolved that the transactions described herein are in the best interests of the
parties and their  respective  shareholders and have authorized and approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:


<PAGE>

                                    ARTICLE 1
                         The Merger and Related Matters

         1.1 Definitions. Any term defined anywhere in this Agreement shall have
the meaning ascribed to it for all purposes of this Agreement  (unless expressly
noted to the contrary). In addition:

         (a) The term  "knowledge"  when used with respect to a party shall mean
the knowledge of any "Executive  Officer" of such party, as such term is defined
in Regulation O, (12 C.F.R. 215).

         (b) The term "Material Adverse Effect",  when applied to a party, shall
mean an event,  occurrence or circumstance which (a) has or is reasonably likely
to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  financial  position,  results  of
operations or business of the party and its  subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or
(b) would materially impair the party's ability to perform its obligations under
this  Agreement  or the  consummation  of the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  provided, however, that material adverse effect
and material impairment shall not be deemed to include the impact of (i) changes
in banking and similar laws of general applicability or interpretations  thereof
by courts or  governmental  authorities,  (ii)  changes  in  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  or  regulatory  accounting  requirements  applicable  to
thrifts,  banks,  savings and loan holding companies and bank holding companies,
generally,  (iii) actions or omissions of FNB or Bedford  Federal taken with the
prior  written  consent  of the  other  in  contemplation  of  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  and (iv) the Merger and related expenses  associated with
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement on the operating performance of
the parties to this Agreement.

         (c) The term  "Previously  Disclosed" by a party shall mean information
set forth in a written  disclosure letter that is delivered by that party to the
other party prior to or  contemporaneously  with the execution of this Agreement
and specifically  designated as information  "Previously  Disclosed" pursuant to
this Agreement.  The inclusion of a given item in such written disclosure letter
shall not be deemed a conclusion or admission that such item (or any other item)
is material or has a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Information  disclosed  for one
section  shall   constitute   disclosure  for  other  sections  whether  or  not
specifically referenced.

         1.2 The Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Date as defined in Section 1.5 hereof,  BBI will be merged with
and into FNB (the  "Merger").  At the Effective  Date, the Merger shall have the
effect as provided in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act.

         1.3 Name and  Continuing  Operations.  The name and banking  offices of
Bedford  Federal will not change as a result of the Merger.  After the Effective
Date, FNB shall continue to be headquartered in Christiansburg, Virginia.

         1.4 Management of FNB and Bedford Federal. Except as noted hereinafter,
the  directors,  officers and employees of Bedford  Federal will not change as a
result  of the  Merger  except  that an  individual  selected  by FNB  shall  be
appointed to the Board of Bedford Federal.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

On the Effective  Date, the number of Directors of FNB shall be increased by two
members who shall be  individuals  recommended  by the BBI Board and selected by
FNB,  at least one of whom shall be  independent  as such term is defined at the
time of such  appointments  under  the  Marketplace  Rules of The  Nasdaq  Stock
Market,  Inc.,  and who shall then be appointed to the Board of FNB. At the next
annual  meeting of  shareholders  of FNB,  management  of FNB will  recommend to
shareholders that the two new members be elected as members of the Board of FNB.
In  addition,  as of the  Effective  Date,  FNB shall  enter into an Addendum to
Employment  Agreement for Harold K. Neal, as attached  hereto as Exhibit 1.4(a).
In addition,  as of the Effective  Date,  FNB shall enter into an agreement with
Harold K. Neal in which FNB  agrees to pay Mr.  Neal  $50,000  each year for two
years  in  consideration  for his  agreement  not to  compete  with  FNB and its
affiliates  for a period of two years from the Effective  Date, as provided in a
Non-competition Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 1.4(b).

         1.5 The Closing and  Effective  Date.  The closing of the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the Plan of Merger shall take place at the
offices of FNB in  Christiansburg,  Virginia  or at such  other  place as may be
mutually  agreed upon by the parties.  The Merger shall become  effective on the
date  shown  on the  Certificate  of  Merger  issued  by the  State  Corporation
Commission of Virginia (the "SCC") effecting the Merger (the "Effective  Date").
Unless otherwise  agreed upon in writing by the chief executive  officers of FNB
and BBI,  subject to the conditions to the  obligations of the parties to effect
the Merger as set forth in Article 7, the parties  shall use their best  efforts
to cause the Effective Date to occur on the first day of the month following the
month in which the  conditions  set forth in  Sections  7.1(a)  and  7.1(b)  are
satisfied. All documents required by the terms of this Agreement to be delivered
at or prior to  consummation  of the Merger will be  exchanged by the parties at
the  closing of the Merger  (the  "Merger  Closing"),  which shall be held on or
before the  Effective  Date.  FNB and BBI shall  execute  and deliver to the SCC
Articles  of Merger  containing  a Plan of Merger in  substantially  the form of
Exhibit A hereto.

                                    ARTICLE 2
                         Basis and Manner of Conversion

         2.1  Conversion of BBI Stock.  At the Effective  Date, by virtue of the
Merger,  each share of the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of BBI ("BBI
Common Stock") issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Date
will be  converted  into  either  cash (the "Cash  Consideration")  or shares of
common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of FNB ("FNB Common Stock"), the "Stock
Consideration"  (which Stock Consideration  together with the Cash Consideration
shall be the "Merger  Consideration"),  in each case as the holder thereof shall
have elected or be deemed to have elected in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof.

         In the case that the Market Value of FNB Common Stock (as defined later
in this  Section 2.1) is equal to or more than $23.50 per share and less than or
equal to $26.00 per share, the Stock  Consideration  will equal 0.9135 shares of
FNB Common  Stock for each  outstanding  share of BBI Common  Stock and the Cash
Consideration  will  equal to 0.9135  times the  Market  Value of a share of FNB
Common Stock for each  outstanding  share of BBI Common Stock.  In the case that
the Market Value of FNB Common Stock is more than $26.00 per share and less than
$30.00 per share,  the Stock  Consideration of 0.9135 shares of FNB Common Stock
for each

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

outstanding  share of BBI Common Stock will be  decreased by .0133625  shares of
FNB Common  Stock for each $0.50  increase in Market  Value  between  $26.00 per
share  and  $30.00  per  share  and the  Cash  Consideration  will  be  adjusted
accordingly.  In the case that the Market  Value of FNB Common Stock is equal to
or greater than $30.00 per share and equal to or less than $32.50 per share, the
Stock  Consideration  will  equal  0.8066  shares of FNB  Common  Stock for each
outstanding  share of BBI  Common  Stock and the Cash  Consideration  will equal
0.8066  times  the  Market  Value  of a  share  of FNB  Common  Stock  for  each
outstanding share of BBI Common Stock.

         The Market  Value of FNB Common  Stock will be the  average of the last
reported  sales  prices per share of FNB Common  Stock as reported on the NASDAQ
Exchange  Composite  Transactions  Tape (as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
or, if not reported thereby,  another authoritative source as chosen by FNB) for
the thirty  consecutive  full trading days on such exchange  (even if FNB Common
Stock  does not trade in each such day)  ending at the close of  trading  on the
tenth  calendar  day  before  the  Effective  Date (the  "Market  Value" and the
"Measurement  Period").  The ratio of shares of FNB's  Common Stock that will be
exchanged  for each  outstanding  share of BBI Common Stock shall be referred to
herein as the  "Exchange  Ratio" and shall be rounded to the nearest  thousandth
decimal point.

         2.2  Allocation.  Notwithstanding  anything  in this  Agreement  to the
contrary,  the aggregate  amount of cash to be issued to  shareholders of BBI in
the Merger shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate value of
the Merger  Consideration (the "Cash Amount");  provided that FNB shall have the
option to change the Cash Number and the Stock Number to more closely follow the
actual elections of BBI shareholders pursuant to this Article 2, so long as such
modification  to the Cash  Number  and the Stock  Number  does not  prevent  the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(d) from being satisfied and in no event shall
the number of shares of FNB Common Stock issued to BBI  shareholder be less than
1,301,122 nor more than 1,473,562 shares,  subject to further  adjustment to the
extent the number of shares of BBI Common  Stock  shall  increase as a result of
the exercise of BBI Options to acquire BBI Common  Stock prior to the  Effective
Date as  permitted  by Section 6.1 of this  Agreement  and for the effect of any
share  adjustments to the extent that shares of FNB Common Stock are utilized by
the  Bedford  Federal  ESOP trust (as defined in Section  6.2(c)),  to repay the
Bedford  Federal  ESOP  loan on or after  the  Effective  Date.  As used in this
Agreement,  the Cash  Number  shall mean the  aggregate  number of shares of BBI
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
the Merger,  which shall be equal to the Cash Amount  divided by the  applicable
Cash  Consideration  per share of BBI Common Stock.  The number of shares of BBI
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive Stock  Consideration (the
"Stock  Number")  will be equal to (i) the number of shares of BBI Common  Stock
issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective  Date of the Merger
less (ii) the sum of (A) the Cash Number and (B) the aggregate  number of shares
of BBI Common Stock to be exchanged for cash pursuant to Section 3.3.


         2.3 Election.  Subject to allocation in accordance  with the provisions
of this  Article,  each record  holder of shares of BBI Common  Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately  prior to the Election  Deadline (as defined in Section
3.1(i))  will be  entitled,  in  accordance  with  Section  3.1, (i) to elect to
receive in respect of shares held in such manner (A) Cash Consideration (a "Cash
Election") or (B) Stock  Consideration (a "Stock  Election") on a share-by-share
basis  thus,


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

making an election for all Cash  Consideration,  all Stock  Consideration,  or a
mixture thereof or (ii) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as
to the receipt of Cash Consideration or Stock  Consideration for all such shares
held by such holder (a "Non-Election"). Shares of BBI Common Stock in respect of
which a Non-Election  is made or as to which no election is made  (collectively,
"Non-Election  Shares")  shall be deemed by the  Exchange  Agent (as  defined in
Section  3.1(i))  to be shares  in  respect  of which  Cash  Elections  or Stock
Elections  have been made,  as the  Exchange  Agent,  as directed by FNB,  shall
determine.  Holders of record of shares of BBI Common Stock who hold such shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative")
may submit  multiple Forms of Election (as hereinafter  defined),  provided that
each such Form of  Election  covers all the  shares of BBI Common  Stock held by
that Representative for a particular beneficial owner.

         2.4 Allocation of Cash Election Shares. In the event that the aggregate
number of shares in respect of which  Cash  Elections  have been made (the "Cash
Election  Shares")  exceeds the Cash  Number,  all shares of BBI Common Stock in
respect of which Stock  Elections have been made (the "Stock  Election  Shares")
and all  Non-Election  Shares will be converted  into the right to receive Stock
Consideration  (and cash in lieu of  fractional  interests  in  accordance  with
Section  3.3),  and Cash  Election  Shares will be  converted  into the right to
receive Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration in the following manner:

         (i) the number of Cash Election Shares covered by each Form of Election
(as defined in Section 3.1(i)) to be converted into Cash  Consideration  will be
determined by  multiplying  the number of Cash Election  Shares  covered by such
Form of Election by a fraction,  (A) the  numerator  of which is the Cash Number
and (B) the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares
rounded down to the nearest whole number; and

         (ii) all Cash Election Shares not converted into Cash  Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.4(i) will be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration  (and cash in lieu of  fractional  interests  in  accordance  with
Section 3.3).

Provided, however, that cash in lieu of fractional interests and cash to be paid
in connection  with rights of dissenting  shareholders,  as provided in Sections
3.3 and 3.5, respectively, shall not be included in any determination of whether
this Section 2.4 shall be given effect.

         2.5  Allocation  of  Stock  Election  Shares.  In the  event  that  the
aggregate  number of Stock Election  Shares  exceeds the Stock Number,  all Cash
Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares (together,  the " Cash Shares") will
be  converted  into the  right to  receive  Cash  Consideration,  and all  Stock
Election  Shares will be converted into the right to receive Cash  Consideration
or Stock Consideration in the following manner:

         (i) the  number  of  Stock  Election  Shares  covered  by each  Form of
Election  to  be  converted  into  Cash  Consideration  will  be  determined  by
multiplying the number of Stock Election Shares covered by such Form of Election
by a fraction,  (A) the numerator of which is the Cash Number less the number of
Cash Shares and (B) the  denominator  of which is the aggregate  number of Stock
Election Shares,

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

rounded down to the nearest  whole  number,  provided that in no event shall the
maximum  number of shares to be issued by FNB pursuant to which a Stock Election
is made exceed  1,473,562  shares and in no event  shall the  minimum  number of
shares to be issued by FNB  pursuant  to which a Stock  Election is made be less
than 1,301,122 shares, subject to further adjustment to the extent the number of
shares of BBI Common  Stock shall  increase  as a result of the  exercise of BBI
Options to acquire BBI Common Stock prior to the Effective  Date as permitted by
Section 6.1 of this Agreement and for the effect of any share adjustments to the
extent that shares of FNB Common Stock are utilized by the Bedford  Federal ESOP
trust to repay the Bedford Federal ESOP loan on or after the Effective Date; and

         (ii) all Stock Election Shares not converted into Cash Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.5(i) will be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration  (and cash in lieu of  fractional  interests  in  accordance  with
Section 3.3).

         2.6 No  Allocation.  In the event that neither  Section 2.4 nor Section
2.5 is applicable,  all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration, all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the
right to receive Stock  Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional  interests
in accordance with Section 3.3) and  Non-Election  Shares will be converted into
the right to receive Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu
of fractional  interests in accordance  with Section 3.3) as the Exchange Agent,
as directed by FNB, shall determine.

         2.7 Computations. The Exchange Agent will make all computations to give
effect to this Article 2.

         2.8 Cancellation of Shares. As of the Effective Date of the Merger, all
such shares of BBI Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and  automatically
be  cancelled  and  retired  and  will  cease  to exist  and  each  holder  of a
certificate  formerly  representing  any such shares of BBI Common Stock (a "BBI
Certificate")  will cease to have any rights with  respect  thereto,  except the
right  to  receive  Merger  Consideration  and  any  additional  cash in lieu of
fractional  shares of FNB  Common  Stock to be  issued or paid in  consideration
therefor upon surrender of such BBI  Certificate  in accordance  with Article 3,
without interest, subject to rights of dissenting shareholders as provided under
Section 3.5.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                               Manner of Exchange

         3.1 Exchange Procedures.

         (i) Not more than 5 days  after the  Merger  has been  approved  by the
shareholders  of FNB  and BBI  (the  "Mailing  Date"),  Registrar  and  Transfer
Company,  Cranford,  New Jersey,  as the exchange agent (the "Exchange  Agent"),
will mail a form of election  (the "Form of Election")  to each  shareholder  of
record of BBI as of a record date as close as practicable to the date of mailing
and mutually agreed


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

to by BBI and FNB. In addition,  the Exchange Agent will use its best efforts to
make the Form of Election  available to the persons who become  shareholders  of
BBI during the period  between  such record  date and the  Effective  Date.  Any
election to receive  Merger  Consideration  will have been properly made only if
the Exchange  Agent shall have  received on the  thirtieth  (30th)  business day
immediately after the Mailing Date (the "Election Deadline"), a Form of Election
properly completed and accompanied by a BBI Certificate  ("Certificate(s)")  for
the shares to which such Form of Election  relates,  acceptable  for transfer on
the books of BBI (or an appropriate guarantee of delivery), as set forth in such
Form of Election.  An election may be revoked only by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. on the Election  Deadline.  If an election
is so revoked, the Certificate(s) (or guarantee of delivery,  as appropriate) to
which such election relates will be promptly  returned to the person  submitting
the same to the Exchange Agent.

         (ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, but in
no event later than five (5) calendar days  thereafter,  the Exchange Agent will
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, whose shares of BBI Common Stock
were  converted  into the right to receive  Merger  Consideration  and those who
failed  to  return a  properly  completed  Form of  Election,  (i) a  letter  of
transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates  will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as
the  Exchange  Agent  may  specify  consistent  with  this  Agreement)  and (ii)
instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

         (iii) With  respect to  properly  made  elections  in  accordance  with
Section  3.1(i),  and upon  surrender in  accordance  with Section  3.1(ii) of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal,  duly  executed,  and such other  documents  as may  reasonably  be
required by the Exchange Agent,  the holder of such Certificate will be entitled
to receive in exchange  therefor the Merger  Consideration  that such holder has
the  right  to  receive  pursuant  to the  provisions  of  Article  2,  and  the
Certificate  so  surrendered  will  forthwith  be  canceled.  In the  event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that are not registered in the transfer  records
of BBI,  as the case may be,  payment  may be issued to a person  other than the
person in whose  name the  Certificate  so  surrendered  is  registered  if such
Certificate  is properly  endorsed or  otherwise in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of such  payment  to a person  other than the  registered  holder of such
Certificate  or establishes  to the  satisfaction  of FNB that such tax has been
paid or is not  applicable.  Until  surrendered as  contemplated by this Section
3.1, each  Certificate  will be deemed at any time after the  Effective  Date to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
that the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such  Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of Article 2. No interest will be paid or will


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions
of Article 2.

         3.2 Distributions  with Respect to Unexchanged  Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to the shares of BBI Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective  Date shall be paid to the holder of any  unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of BBI Common Stock represented  thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of any  fractional  shares shall be paid to any such
holder  pursuant to Section 3.3.  Subject to the effect of  unclaimed  property,
escheat and other applicable laws,  following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate  representing  whole shares
of BBI Common Stock issued in exchange  therefor,  without interest,  (i) at the
time of such  surrender,  the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of BBI Common  Stock to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to Section
3.3,  and (ii) the amount of dividends or other  distributions,  if any,  with a
record date after the Effective Date.

         3.3 No Fractional Securities. No FNB Certificates or scrip representing
fractional  shares of FNB Common  Stock shall be issued upon the  surrender  for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional shares shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of FNB Common Stock. A holder
of Shares  converted in the Merger who would  otherwise  have been entitled to a
fractional share of FNB Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment
(without  interest) in lieu of such fractional share in an amount  determined by
multiplying  (i) the  fractional  share  interest  to which  such  holder  would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the equivalent  exchange value of FNB Common Stock
in the Merger.

         3.4 Certain  Adjustments.  If, after the date hereof and on or prior to
the Effective Date, the outstanding  shares of BBI Common Stock shall be changed
into  a  different   number  of  shares  by  reason  of  any   reclassification,
recapitalization,  split-up,  combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other  securities  is  declared  thereon  with a record date
within such period,  or any similar event shall occur, the Merger  Consideration
will be  adjusted  accordingly  to provide to the  holders of BBI Common  Stock,
respectively,  the same economic  effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such reclassification,  recapitalization,  split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend or similar event.

         3.5 Rights of Dissenting Shareholders.  Shareholders of FNB and BBI who
object to the Merger will be entitled  to the rights and  remedies  set forth in
sections 13.1-729 through 13.1-741 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act.

                    ARTICLE 4 Representations and Warranties

         4.1  Representations and Warranties of BBI. BBI represents and warrants
to FNB as follows:

         (a)  Organization,  Standing and Power.  (1) BBI is a corporation  duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Virginia. It
has all requisite  corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted and to own and operate its assets,  properties and business, and
BBI has the corporate  power and authority to

                                      -8-

execute and deliver  this  Agreement  and perform the  respective  terms of this
Agreement and Plan of Merger.  BBI is duly  registered as a unitary  savings and
loan holding  company  under 12  U.S.C.ss.  1467a.  Bedford  Federal and Central
Virginia   Financial   Services  are  the  only  subsidiaries  of  BBI  and  are
wholly-owned  by it. Bedford  Federal is a federal savings bank, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States, is in
compliance in all material  respects with all rules and regulations  promulgated
by any relevant  regulatory  authority,  has all requisite  corporate  power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to own and operate
its assets,  properties  and  business,  is an "insured  bank" as defined in the
Federal Deposit  Insurance Act and applicable  regulations  thereunder,  and its
deposits are insured to the fullest extent allowed by law by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

         (2) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  neither BBI nor Bedford  Federal
(collectively  with BBI, the "BBI Companies") owns any equity  securities of any
other corporation or entity.

         (b) Authority. (1) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger and the  consummation  of the Merger  have been duly and  validly
authorized  by all  necessary  corporate  action on the part of BBI,  except the
approval of shareholders. The Agreement has been approved by a unanimous vote of
BBI's Board of Directors and represents the legal, valid, and binding obligation
of BBI, enforceable against BBI in accordance with its terms (except in all such
cases as  enforceability  may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
merger,  moratorium  or similar laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'
rights  generally and except that the  availability  of the equitable  remedy of
specific  performance  or injunctive  relief is subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding may be brought).

         (2)  Neither  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the   Agreement,   the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor the compliance by BBI
with any of the provisions  thereof will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provision of the Articles of  Incorporation or Bylaws of BBI, (ii) except
as  Previously  Disclosed,  constitute  or  result  in the  breach  of any term,
condition or provision  of, or  constitute  default  under,  or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect to, or result in
the creation of any lien,  charge or encumbrance upon, any property or assets of
the BBI Companies pursuant to (A) any note, bond,  mortgage,  indenture,  or (B)
any material  license,  agreement,  lease or other instrument or obligation,  to
which  any of the BBI  Companies  is a party or by  which  any of them or any of
their  properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to the receipt of the
requisite  approvals  referred  to in Section  5.7,  violate  any  order,  writ,
injunction,  decree,  statute,  rule or regulation  applicable to any of the BBI
Companies or any of their properties or assets.

         (c) Capital Structure.  The authorized capital stock of BBI consists of
2,750,000  shares  of common  stock,  par value  $0.10  per share  ("BBI  Common
Stock"),  of which 2,016,368 shares are issued and  outstanding,  fully paid and
nonassessable,  not subject to shareholder  preemptive rights, and not issued in
violation of any agreement to which BBI is a party or otherwise bound, or of any
registration or qualification provisions of any federal or state securities laws
and outstanding options to purchase 114,124 shares of BBI Common Stock;


                                      -9-
<PAGE>


250,000  shares of preferred  stock,  par value $0.10 per share ("BBI  Preferred
Stock"),  none of which shares are issued and outstanding.  Except as Previously
Disclosed,  there  are  no  outstanding  understandings  or  commitments  of any
character  pursuant to which BBI and any of the BBI Companies  could be required
or expected to issue shares of capital stock.

         (d) Ownership,  Capital Structure, and Organization of Bedford Federal.
(1) BBI does not own,  directly  or  indirectly,  5% or more of the  outstanding
capital  stock or other  voting  securities  of any  corporation,  bank or other
organization  actively  engaged in business except Bedford Federal and a service
corporation  wholly-owned  by BBI,  Central  Virginia  Financial  Services.  The
outstanding shares of capital stock of Bedford Federal have been duly authorized
and are validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares
are owned by BBI free and clear of all liens,  claims and  encumbrances and were
not issued in violation of any agreement or of any  regulation or  qualification
provisions of federal or state securities laws. No rights are authorized, issued
or  outstanding  with respect to the capital stock of Bedford  Federal and there
are no agreements, understandings or commitments relating to the right of BBI to
vote or to  dispose  of said  shares.  None of the  shares of  capital  stock of
Bedford  Federal has been issued in  violation of the  preemptive  rights of any
person.

         (2) Bedford Federal is a duly organized  federal savings bank,  validly
existing and in good standing under  applicable  laws.  Bedford  Federal (i) has
full corporate  power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as now conducted except where the absence of such power
or  authority  would  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial
condition, results of operations or business of BBI on a consolidated basis, and
(ii) is duly  qualified  to do business  in the states of the United  States and
foreign  jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business  requires  such  qualification  and where  failure to do qualify
would have a material  adverse  effect on the  financial  condition,  results of
operations or business of BBI on a consolidated  basis.  Bedford Federal has all
federal,  state,  local and foreign  governmental  authorizations  and  licenses
necessary for it to own or lease its  properties  and assets and to carry on its
business  as it is now being  conducted,  except  where  failure to obtain  such
authorization  or  license  would  not have a  material  adverse  effect  on its
business.

         (e)  Financial  Statements.  BBI's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the
fiscal year ended  September 30, 2002,  and all other  documents  filed or to be
filed subsequent to September 30, 2002, under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d)
of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder,  the "Exchange Act"), in the form filed with the SEC (in
each such case, the "BBI Financial Statements") did not and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,  in light of
the  circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading;  and each of the
balance sheets in or incorporated by reference into the BBI Financial Statements
(including  the related notes and schedules  thereto)  fairly  presents and will
fairly  present  the  financial  position  of the entity or entities to which it
relates  as of its date and each of the  statements  of income  and  changes  in
stockholders'  equity  and  cash  flows  or  equivalent  statements  in the  BBI
Financial Statements  (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
presents  and  will  fairly  present  the  results  of  operations,  changes  in
stockholders'  equity  and  changes  in cash  flows,  as the case may be, of the


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

entity or entities to which it relates  for the  periods set forth  therein,  in
each  case  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted   accounting   principles
consistently  applied to banks and savings and loan holding companies during the
periods  involved,  except  as may be  noted  therein,  subject  to  normal  and
recurring year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited statements.

         (f) Absence of Undisclosed  Liabilities.  At September 30, 2002, and at
any subsequent date reflected in such BBI Financial Statements,  none of the BBI
Companies  had any  obligation  or liability  (contingent  or  otherwise) of any
nature which were not  reflected  in the BBI  Financial  Statements,  except for
those which in the aggregate are immaterial or have been Previously Disclosed.

         (g) Legal  Proceedings;  Compliance  with  Laws.  Except as  Previously
Disclosed,  there are no actions, suits or proceedings instituted or pending or,
to the knowledge of BBI,  threatened or probable of assertion against any of the
BBI Companies, or against any property, asset, interest or right of any of them,
that are reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material  Adverse  Effect on the  financial  condition of BBI on a  consolidated
basis or that are reasonably  expected to threaten or impede the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. None of the BBI Companies is a
party to any agreement or instrument  or subject to any judgment,  order,  writ,
injunction,  decree or rule that might reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),  business or prospects
of BBI on a consolidated basis. Except as Previously  Disclosed,  as of the date
of this  Agreement,  none of the BBI Companies nor any of their  properties is a
party  to  or  is  subject  to  any  order,  decree,  agreement,  memorandum  of
understanding  or similar  arrangement  with, or a commitment  letter or similar
submission  to, any federal or state  governmental  agency or authority  charged
with the  supervision  or  regulation  of  depository  institutions  or mortgage
lenders or engaged in the insurance of deposits  which  restricts or purports to
restrict in any material respect the conduct of the business of it or any of its
subsidiaries or properties, or in any manner relates to the capital,  liquidity,
credit policies or management of it; and except as Previously Disclosed, none of
the BBI Companies has been advised by any such  regulatory  authority  that such
authority  is  contemplating  issuing  or  requesting  (or  is  considering  the
appropriateness  of issuing or requesting)  any such order,  decree,  agreement,
memorandum of  understanding,  commitment letter or similar  submission.  To the
best knowledge of BBI, the BBI Companies have complied in all material  respects
with all laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations or orders applicable to its
business (including environmental laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations or
orders).

         (h)  Regulatory  Approvals.  BBI knows of no reason why the  regulatory
approvals  referred  to in Section  7.1(b)  should not be  obtained  without the
imposition of any condition of the type referred to in Section  7.1(b).  Bedford
Federal  is in  material  compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of  the
Community  Reinvestment  Act and the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  and
Bedford Federal  currently has a CRA rating of  satisfactory  or better.  To the
knowledge  of  BBI,  there  is no  fact  or  circumstance  or  set of  facts  or
circumstances  that would  cause  Bedford  Federal  to fail to comply  with such
provisions or cause the rating of Bedford Federal to fall below satisfactory.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

         (i) Labor  Relations.  None of the BBI  Companies  is a party to, or is
bound by any collective  bargaining  agreement,  contract or other  agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is it the subject of
a proceeding  asserting that is has committed an unfair labor  practice  (within
the  meaning of the  National  Labor  Relations  Act) or seeking to compel it to
bargain with any labor  organization  as to wages and  conditions of employment,
nor is there any strike or other labor dispute  involving it, pending or, to the
best of its knowledge, threatened, nor is it aware of any activity involving its
employees  seeking to certify a  collective  bargaining  unit or engaging in any
other organizational activity.

         (j) Tax Matters.  The BBI Companies have filed all federal,  state, and
local tax returns and reports  required to be filed, and all taxes shown by such
returns to be due and payable have been paid or are  reflected as a liability in
the BBI Financial  Statements or are being contested in good faith and have been
Previously  Disclosed.  Except to the  extent  that  liabilities  therefore  are
specifically  reflected in the BBI Financial  Statements,  there are no federal,
state or local tax liabilities of the BBI Companies other than  liabilities that
have arisen since December 31, 2001, all of which have been properly  accrued or
otherwise provided for on the books and records of the BBI Companies.  Except as
Previously  Disclosed,  no tax return or report of any of the BBI  Companies  is
under  examination by any taxing authority or the subject of any  administrative
or judicial  proceeding,  and no unpaid tax deficiency has been asserted against
any of the BBI Companies by any taxing authority.

         (k) Property. Except as Previously Disclosed or reserved against in the
BBI  Financial  Statements,  all of the BBI Companies  have good and  marketable
title free and clear of all material liens,  encumbrances,  charges, defaults or
equities of whatever  character  to all of the material  properties  and assets,
tangible or intangible, reflected in the BBI Financial Statements as being owned
by the BBI Companies as of the dates thereof.  To the best knowledge of BBI, all
buildings, and all fixtures,  equipment, and other property and assets which are
material to its business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases
by the BBI Companies are held under valid instruments  enforceable in accordance
with  their  respective  terms,  subject  to  bankruptcy,   insolvency,  merger,
moratorium and similar laws. The buildings, structures, and appurtenances owned,
leased,  or occupied by the BBI Companies  are, to the best knowledge of BBI, in
good  operating  condition,  in a state of good  maintenance  and repair and (i)
comply with applicable zoning and other municipal laws and regulations, and (ii)
there are no defects  therein which  materially  interfere  with BBI's  business
operations.

         (l) Reports.  Since January 1, 2000,  the BBI Companies  have filed all
reports and  statements,  together with any amendments  required to be made with
respect  thereto,  that were  required  to be filed with the OTS,  the SEC,  the
Federal Reserve,  the SCC, and any other governmental or regulatory authority or
agency having jurisdiction over their operations.

         (m) Employee Benefit Plans and Other Compensatory Arrangements.  (1) As
soon as practicable,  BBI will deliver for FNB's review true and complete copies
of all material  pension,  retirement,  profit-sharing,  deferred  compensation,
stock option,  bonus,  vacation or other material incentive plans or agreements,
all material  medical,  dental or other health plans,  all cafeteria or flexible
benefits  plans,  all life  insurance  plans  and all  other  material  employee
compensation,  benefit  plans or fringe  benefit  plans and any related trust or
other

funding instrument,  including, without limitation, all "employee benefit plans"
as that term is  defined  in  Section  3(3) of the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),  currently  adopted,  maintained by,
sponsored in whole or in part by, or  contributed  to by BBI or Bedford  Federal
for the benefit of current or former employees,  retirees or other beneficiaries
eligible to participate (collectively,  the "BBI Benefit Plans"). Any of the BBI
Benefit  Plans  which is an  "employee  pension  benefit  plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a "BBI ERISA Plan."

         (2) No BBI  Benefit  Plan is or has  been a  "multiemployer  plan,"  as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

         (3) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  all BBI Benefit  Plans,  and the
reporting  and  disclosure  relating  thereto,  are in compliance in form and in
operation with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "IRC"), and any other applicable laws, rules and regulations the
breach or violation  of which could  result in a material  liability to BBI on a
consolidated  basis.  In the case of any plan intended to be qualified under IRC
Section 401,  compliance  with such  qualification  requirements  shall mean the
timely adoption of all plan  amendments and the receipt of a current,  favorable
determination  letter from the Internal  Revenue  Service  based on laws changes
effective  through 2001 for which the remedial  amendment  period under  Section
401(b) of the Code has ended and the  operation of the plan in  accordance  with
its terms or in  accordance  with any  subsequently  enacted  law for which such
remedial amendment period for adopting plan amendments has not yet ended.

         (4) No BBI ERISA Plan which is subject to the minimum funding standards
of Section 302 of ERISA or IRC Section 412 has any "unfunded current liability,"
as that term is defined in Section  302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA,  and the present fair
market value of the assets of any such plan which is a "defined  benefit  plan,"
as that term is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA,  exceeds the plan's  "benefit
liabilities,"  as that term is  defined in Section  4001(a)(16)  of ERISA,  when
determined  under actuarial  factors that would apply if the plan was terminated
in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.

         (5) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  there are no issues or  disputes
with respect to any BBI Benefit  Plan or the  administration  thereof  currently
existing  between any employer  participating  therein,  or any trustee or other
fiduciary  thereunder,  and any  governmental  agency,  any  current  or  former
participant  of such  plan or  beneficiary  of any such  employee,  or any other
person or entity other than claims for  benefits in the  ordinary  course of the
administration of such plan.

         (6) Except as Previously Disclosed, as provided under Title IV of ERISA
or  as  otherwise  specifically  provided  in  this  Agreement,   there  are  no
restrictions  on the rights of BBI or Bedford  Federal to amend or terminate any
BBI Benefit Plan  without  incurring  any  liability  thereunder  other than for
benefits accrued to the date of the termination.

         (7)  Except  as  Previously  Disclosed  or  as  otherwise  specifically
provided in this Agreement, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions described herein will (i) result in any
payment to any person


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

(including   without   limitation   any  severance   compensation   or  payment,
unemployment compensation, "golden parachute" or "change in control" payment, or
otherwise)  becoming due under any plan or agreement to any  director,  officer,
employee or consultant,  (ii) increase any benefits  otherwise payable under any
plan or agreement, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefit.

         (n) Investment  Securities.  Except as Previously  Disclosed and except
for pledges to secure public and trust deposits and obligations under agreements
pursuant to which any of the BBI  Companies  has sold  securities  subject to an
obligation to repurchase, none of the investment securities reflected in the BBI
Financial Statements is subject to any restriction,  contractual,  statutory, or
otherwise,  which  would  materially  impair  the  ability of the holder of such
investment to dispose freely of any such investment at any time.

         (o) Certain Contracts. (1) Except as Previously Disclosed,  neither BBI
nor  any  BBI  subsidiary  is a party  to,  or is  bound  by,  (i) any  material
agreement,  arrangement  or commitment,  (ii) any agreement,  indenture or other
instrument  relating to the borrowing of money by BBI or Bedford  Federal or the
guarantee by BBI or Bedford Federal of any such obligation, (iii) any agreement,
arrangement  or  commitment  relating to the  employment  of a consultant or the
employment,  election, retention in office or severance of any present or former
director  or officer,  (iv) any  agreement  to make loans or for the  provision,
purchase or sale of goods,  services or property  between BBI or Bedford Federal
and any  director  or officer of BBI or  Bedford  Federal,  or any member of the
immediate  family or affiliate  of any of the  foregoing,  or (v) any  agreement
between BBI or Bedford  Federal and any 5% or more  shareholder  of BBI; in each
case other than  agreements  entered into in the ordinary  course of the banking
business of BBI or Bedford Federal consistent with past practice.

         (2) Neither BBI or Bedford  Federal,  nor to the  knowledge of BBI, the
other party  thereto,  is in default under any material  agreement,  commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument whether entered into in
the ordinary  course of business or otherwise,  nor has there occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both,  would constitute such
a default,  other than  defaults of loan  agreements  by  borrowers  from BBI or
Bedford Federal in the ordinary course of its business.

         (p)  Insurance.  A complete  list of all  policies  or binders of fire,
liability,  product  liability,  workmen's  compensation,  vehicular  and  other
insurance  held  by or on  behalf  of the  BBI  Companies  has  previously  been
furnished to FNB and all such policies or binders are valid and  enforceable  in
accordance  with their terms,  are in full force and effect,  and insure against
risks and liabilities to the extent and in the manner customary for the industry
and are deemed  appropriate  and sufficient by BBI. The BBI Companies are not in
default with respect to any provision contained in any such policy or binder and
have not failed to give any notice or present any claim under any such policy or
binder in due and timely fashion.  None of the BBI Companies has received notice
of  cancellation  or non-renewal  of any such policy or binder.  None of the BBI
Companies has knowledge of any inaccuracy in any  application  for such policies
or binders,  any failure to pay premiums  when due or any similar state of facts
or the  occurrence of any event that is reasonably  likely to form the basis for
any material  claim  against it not fully  covered  (except to the extent of any
applicable deductible) by the policies or binders


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

referred to above. None of the BBI Companies has received notice from any of its
insurance carriers that any insurance  premiums will be increased  materially in
the future or that any such  insurance  coverage  will not be  available  in the
future on substantially the same terms as now in effect.

         (q)  Loans,  OREO,  and  Allowance  for  Loan  Losses.  (1)  Except  as
Previously  Disclosed,  and  except for  matters  which  individually  or in the
aggregate,  do not  materially  adversely  effect  the  Merger or the  financial
condition of BBI, to BBI's  knowledge each loan reflected as an asset in the BBI
Financial  Statements  or the  financial  statements  of Bedford  Federal (i) is
evidenced by notes,  agreements,  or other evidences of  indebtedness  which are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured,  has been
secured by valid liens and security  interests  which have been  perfected,  and
(iii) is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, and
other laws of general  applicability  relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity  principles.  All loans and extensions of credit which are
subject to  regulation  of the Federal  Reserve  which have been made by BBI and
Bedford Federal comply therewith.

         (2) The  classification  on the books and  records  of BBI and  Bedford
Federal of loans  and/or  non-performing  assets as  nonaccrual,  troubled  debt
restructuring,  OREO or other similar  classification,  complies in all material
respects with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable regulatory
accounting principles.

         (3) Except for liens,  security  interests,  claims,  charges,  or such
other encumbrances as have been appropriately  reserved for in the BBI Financial
Statements or are not material,  title to the OREO is good and  marketable,  and
there are no adverse claims or encumbrances  on the OREO. All title,  hazard and
other  insurance  claims and mortgage  guaranty  claims with respect to the OREO
have been timely filed and neither BBI nor Bedford Federal has been received any
notice of denial of any such claim.

         (4) BBI and Bedford Federal are in possession of all of the OREO or, if
any of  the  OREO  remains  occupied  by  the  mortgagor,  eviction  or  summary
proceedings  have been  commenced or rental  arrangements  providing  for market
rental rates have been agreed upon and BBI and/or Bedford Federal are diligently
pursuing  such  eviction of summary  proceedings  or such  rental  arrangements.
Except as Previously Disclosed, no legal proceeding or quasi-legal proceeding is
pending or, to the knowledge of BBI and Bedford Federal,  threatened  concerning
any OREO or any servicing  activity or omission to provide a servicing  activity
with respect to any of the OREO.

         (5) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  all loans made by any of the BBI
Companies to facilitate  the  disposition  of OREO are  performing in accordance
with their terms.

         (6) The  allowance  for possible loan losses shown on the BBI Financial
Statements  was,  and the  allowance  for  possible  loan  losses  shown  on the
financial  statements  of BBI as of dates  subsequent  to the  execution of this
Agreement  will be, in each case as of the dates  thereof and in the judgment of
BBI's  management,  adequate in all  material  respects to


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

provide for possible  losses,  net of  recoveries  relating to loans  previously
charged off, on loans outstanding (including accrued interest receivable) of the
BBI Companies and other  extensions of credit  (including  letters of credit and
commitments to make loans or extend credit) by BBI.

         (r) Absence of Material  Changes and Events.  Since September 30, 2002,
(i) the BBI Companies have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
and usual course consistent with past practices,  and (ii) no event has occurred
or circumstance  arisen that, in the aggregate,  has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the BBI Companies.

         (s) Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied or to
be  supplied  by BBI for  inclusion  in the  Registration  Statement,  the proxy
statement/prospectus or any other document to be filed with the SEC or any other
regulatory  authority in connection with the transactions  contemplated  hereby,
will, at the respective  time such documents are filed,  and, in the case of the
Registration Statement,  when it becomes effective and with respect to the proxy
statement/prospectus,  when  first  mailed  to FNB  shareholders,  be  false  or
misleading  with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the  statements  therein not  misleading,  or, in the
case of the proxy statement/prospectus or any supplement thereto, at the time of
the  FNB  Shareholders'  Meeting  or BBI  Shareholders'  Meeting,  be  false  or
misleading  with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier  communication with respect to
the solicitation of any proxy for the FNB Shareholders'  Meeting.  All documents
that  BBI is  responsible  for  filing  with  the  SEC or any  other  regulatory
authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as
to  form in all  material  respects  with  the  provisions  of  applicable  law,
including applicable provisions of federal and state securities law.

         (t) Brokers and Finders.  Neither BBI nor Bedford  Federal,  nor any of
their  respective  officers,  directors or  employees,  has employed any broker,
finder  or  financial  advisor  or  incurred  any  liability  for  any  fees  or
commissions in connection with the transactions  contemplated herein, except for
McDonald Investments, Inc.

         (u) Repurchase  Agreements.  With respect to all agreements pursuant to
which BBI or Bedford Federal has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell,  if any,  BBI or  Bedford  Federal,  as the  case  may be,  has a valid,
perfected first lien or security interest in the government  securities or other
collateral securing the repurchase  agreement,  and the value of such collateral
equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

         (v) Trust Accounts. Bedford Federal does not provide trust services.

         (w) Environmental  Matters. (1) Except as Previously Disclosed,  to the
best of BBI's  knowledge,  neither  BBI nor Bedford  Federal  owns or leases any
properties  affected by toxic waste, radon gas or other hazardous  conditions or
constructed in part with the use of asbestos. Each of BBI and Bedford Federal is
in substantial  compliance  with all  Environmental  Laws  applicable to real or
personal properties in which it has a direct fee ownership or, with respect to a
direct interest as lessee,  applicable to the leasehold premises or, to the best
knowledge of BBI and Bedford  Federal,  the  premises on which the  leasehold is
situated.  Neither

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

BBI nor Bedford  Federal has received  any  communication  alleging  that BBI or
Bedford  Federal is not in such compliance and, to the best knowledge of BBI and
Bedford Federal,  there are no present  circumstances  (including  Environmental
Laws that have been  adopted but are not yet  effective)  that would  prevent or
interfere with the continuation of such compliance.

         (2) There  are no  legal,  administrative,  arbitral  or other  claims,
causes  of action or  governmental  investigations  of any  nature,  seeking  to
impose,  or that could result in the  imposition,  on BBI and Bedford Federal of
any  liability  arising  under any  Environmental  Laws  pending or, to the best
knowledge  of BBI and  Bedford  Federal,  threatened  against (A) BBI or Bedford
Federal,  (B) any person or entity whose liability for any Environmental  Claim,
BBI or Bedford Federal has or may have retained or assumed either  contractually
or by  operation  of law,  or (C) any real or  personal  property  which  BBI or
Bedford  Federal owns or leases,  or has been or is judged to have managed or to
have supervised or participated in the management of, which liability might have
a material  adverse  effect on the business,  financial  condition or results of
operations  of BBI.  BBI and Bedford  Federal are not subject to any  agreement,
order,  judgment,  decree  or  memorandum  by or with  any  court,  governmental
authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any such liability.

         (3) To the best  knowledge  of BBI and  Bedford  Federal,  there are no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, or Environmental Claims or
other claims,  causes of action or  governmental  investigations  of any nature,
seeking to impose,  or that could  result in the  imposition,  on BBI or Bedford
Federal  of any  liability  arising  under any  Environmental  Laws  pending  or
threatened against any real or personal property in which BBI or Bedford Federal
holds a security  interest  in  connection  with a loan or a loan  participation
which liability might have a material adverse effect on the business,  financial
condition  or results of  operations  of BBI.  BBI and  Bedford  Federal are not
subject to any agreement,  order, judgment,  decree or memorandum by or with any
court,  governmental  authority,  regulatory  agency or third party imposing any
such liability.

         (4) With respect to all real and personal  property  owned or leased by
BBI or Bedford Federal, other than OREO, BBI has made available to FNB copies of
any environmental audits,  analyses and surveys that have been prepared relating
to such properties.  With respect to all OREO held by BBI or Bedford Federal and
all real or personal property which BBI or Bedford Federal has been or is judged
to have managed or to have  supervised or participated in the management of, BBI
has made  available to FNB the  information  relating to such OREO  available to
BBI. BBI and Bedford Federal are in compliance in all material respects with all
recommendations  contained  in any  environmental  audits,  analyses and surveys
relating  to any  of  the  properties,  real  or  personal,  described  in  this
subsection (4).

         (5) There are no past or present  actions,  activities,  circumstances,
conditions,  events or incidents,  including,  without limitation,  the release,
emission,  discharge or disposal of any Materials of Environmental Concern, that
could  reasonably  form the basis of any  Environmental  Claim or other claim or
action or governmental  investigation that could result in the imposition of any
material  liability arising under any Environmental  Laws currently in effect or
adopted  but not yet  effective  against  BBI or Bedford  Federal or against any
person or entity

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

whose  liability for any  Environmental  Claim BBI or Bedford Federal has or may
have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.

         (x) Investment  Banking  Letter.  BBI has received a written opinion in
form and substance satisfactory to BBI from McDonald Investments, Inc. addressed
to BBI,  which opinion is dated as of the date of the  Agreement,  to the effect
that the terms of the Merger,  including the Exchange  Ratio,  are fair,  from a
financial point of view, to BBI.

         4.2  Representations and Warranties of FNB. FNB represents and warrants
to BBI as follows:

         (a)  Organization,  Standing and Power.  (1) FNB is a corporation  duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Virginia. It
has all requisite  corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted and to own and operate its assets,  properties and business, and
FNB has the corporate  power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and perform the respective  terms of this  Agreement and Plan of Merger.  FNB is
duly  registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956. First National Bank and FNB Salem Bank & Trust,  National  Association are
each a wholly owned subsidiary of FNB, are each a national banking  association,
duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good  standing  under the laws of the
United  States,  are each in compliance in all material  respects with all rules
and regulations  promulgated by any relevant regulatory authority,  each has all
requisite  corporate  power and  authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted and to own and operate its assets,  properties and business,  are each
an "insured bank" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable
regulations  thereunder  and their  deposits  are insured to the fullest  extent
allowed  by law by the Bank  Insurance  Fund of the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation.

         (2) FNB has Previously  Disclosed its subsidiary  corporations (and the
subsidiaries  thereof) (the "FNB Subsidiaries"  and,  collectively with FNB, the
"FNB Companies"). Except as Previously Disclosed, none of the FNB Companies owns
any equity securities of any other corporation or entity.

         (b) Authority. (1) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger and the  consummation  of the Merger  have been duly and  validly
authorized  by all  necessary  corporate  action on the part of FNB,  except the
approval of shareholders. The Agreement represents the legal, valid, and binding
obligation of FNB,  enforceable against FNB in accordance with its terms (except
in all such cases as  enforceability  may be limited by  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  merger,  moratorium or similar laws  affecting the  enforcement  of
creditors'  rights  generally and except that the  availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

         (2)  Neither  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the   Agreement,   the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor the compliance by FNB
with any of the provisions  thereof will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provision of the Articles of  Incorporation or Bylaws of FNB, (ii) except
as  Previously  Disclosed,  constitute  or  result  in the


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

breach of any term,  condition or provision of, or constitute  default under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect
to, or result in the  creation  of any lien,  charge or  encumbrance  upon,  any
property  or  assets  of the  FNB  Companies  pursuant  to (A) any  note,  bond,
mortgage,  indenture,  or (B) any material  license,  agreement,  lease or other
instrument  or  obligation,  to which any of the FNB  Companies is a party or by
which any of them or any of their  properties  or assets may be bound,  or (iii)
subject to the receipt of the  requisite  approvals  referred to in Section 4.7,
violate  any  order,  writ,  injunction,  decree,  statute,  rule or  regulation
applicable to any of the FNB Companies or any of their properties or assets.

         (c) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of FNB consists of:
25,000,000  shares  of common  stock,  par value  $5.00 per share  ("FNB  Common
Stock"),  of which 5,813,897 shares are issued and  outstanding,  fully paid and
nonassessable,  not subject to shareholder  preemptive rights, and not issued in
violation of any agreement to which FNB is a party or otherwise bound, or of any
registration  or  qualification  provisions  of any federal or state  securities
laws.  The shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of BBI
Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger will have been duly authorized and,
when  issued in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement,  will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and subject to no preemptive rights. Except
as Previously Disclosed,  there are no outstanding understandings or commitments
of any  character  pursuant to which FNB and any of the FNB  Companies  could be
required or expected to issue shares of capital stock.

         (d)  Ownership  of  the  FNB  Subsidiaries;  Capital  Structure  of FNB
Subsidiaries;  and Organization of the FNB  Subsidiaries.  (1) FNB does not own,
directly or  indirectly,  5% or more of the  outstanding  capital stock or other
voting  securities  of any  corporation,  bank or  other  organization  actively
engaged in business except as Previously  Disclosed.  The outstanding  shares of
capital stock of each FNB Subsidiary  have been duly  authorized and are validly
issued,  and are fully paid and  nonassessable  and all such shares are owned by
FNB or an FNB Subsidiary  free and clear of all liens,  claims and  encumbrances
and were not  issued in  violation  of any  agreement  or of any  regulation  or
qualification  provisions  of federal or state  securities  laws.  No rights are
authorized,  issued or outstanding  with respect to the capital stock of any FNB
Subsidiary and there are no agreements,  understandings or commitments  relating
to the right of FNB to vote or to dispose of said shares.  None of the shares of
capital  stock  of any FNB  Subsidiary  has  been  issued  in  violation  of the
preemptive rights of any person.

         (2) Each FNB Subsidiary is a duly organized corporation or association,
validly existing and in good standing under applicable laws. Each FNB Subsidiary
(i) has full  corporate  power  and  authority  to own,  lease and  operate  its
properties  and to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  except  where  the
absence of such power or authority  would not have a material  adverse effect on
the  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  or  business  of  FNB  on a
consolidated  basis,  and (ii) is duly qualified to do business in the states of
the United  States and foreign  jurisdictions  where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business  requires such  qualification  and where
failure to do qualify  would have a  material  adverse  effect on the  financial
condition,  results of  operations or business of FNB on a  consolidated  basis.
Each FNB  Subsidiary  has all  federal,  state,  local and foreign  governmental
authorizations  and licenses necessary for it to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

on its business as it is now being  conducted,  except  where  failure to obtain
such  authorization  or license would not have a material  adverse effect on the
business of such FNB Subsidiary.

         (e)  Financial  Statements.  FNB's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended  December 31,  2001,  and all other  documents  filed or to be
filed  subsequent to December 31, 2001 under Sections 13(a),  13(c), 14 or 15(d)
of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder,  the "Exchange Act"), in the form filed with the SEC (in
each such case, the "FNB Financial Statements") did not and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,  in light of
the  circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading;  and each of the
balance sheets in or incorporated by reference into the FNB Financial Statements
(including  the related notes and schedules  thereto)  fairly  presents and will
fairly  present  the  financial  position  of the entity or entities to which it
relates  as of its date and each of the  statements  of income  and  changes  in
stockholders'  equity  and  cash  flows  or  equivalent  statements  in the  FNB
Financial Statements  (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
presents  and  will  fairly  present  the  results  of  operations,  changes  in
stockholders'  equity  and  changes  in cash  flows,  as the case may be, of the
entity or entities to which it relates  for the  periods set forth  therein,  in
each  case  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted   accounting   principles
consistently  applied to banks and bank  holding  companies  during the  periods
involved,  except  as may be noted  therein,  subject  to normal  and  recurring
year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited statements.

         (f) Absence of  Undisclosed  Liabilities.  At December 31, 2001, and at
any subsequent date reflected in such FNB Financial Statements,  none of the FNB
Companies  had any  obligation  or liability  (contingent  or  otherwise) of any
nature which were not  reflected  in the FNB  Financial  Statements,  except for
those which in the aggregate are immaterial or have been Previously Disclosed.

         (g) Legal  Proceedings;  Compliance  with  Laws.  Except as  Previously
Disclosed,  there are no actions, suits or proceedings instituted or pending or,
to the best knowledge of FNB, threatened or probable of assertion against any of
the FNB Companies,  or against any property,  asset, interest or right of any of
them,  that are  reasonably  expected  to have,  either  individually  or in the
aggregate,  a Material  Adverse  Effect on the  financial  condition of FNB on a
consolidated  basis or that are  reasonably  expected  to threaten or impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the FNB
Companies is a party to any  agreement or instrument or subject to any judgment,
order,  writ,  injunction,  decree or rule that might  reasonably be expected to
have a  material  adverse  effect on the  condition  (financial  or  otherwise),
business or  prospects  of FNB on a  consolidated  basis.  Except as  Previously
Disclosed,  as of the date of this Agreement,  none of the FNB Companies nor any
of their properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree, agreement,
memorandum of understanding or similar  arrangement with, or a commitment letter
or similar submission to, any federal or state governmental  agency or authority
charged  with the  supervision  or  regulation  of  depository  institutions  or
mortgage  lenders or engaged in the  insurance  of deposits  which  restricts or
purports to restrict in any  material  respect the conduct of the business of it
or any of its  subsidiaries  or  properties,  or in any  manner  relates  to the
capital,  liquidity,  credit  policies  or  management  of  it;  and  except  as
Previously  Disclosed,  none of the

                                      -20-

FNB  Companies  has been  advised  by any such  regulatory  authority  that such
authority  is  contemplating  issuing  or  requesting  (or  is  considering  the
appropriateness  of issuing or requesting)  any such order,  decree,  agreement,
memorandum of  understanding,  commitment letter or similar  submission.  To the
best knowledge of FNB, the FNB Companies have complied in all material  respects
with all laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations or orders applicable to its
business (including environmental laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations or
orders).

         (h)  Regulatory  Approvals.  FNB knows of no reason why the  regulatory
approvals  referred  to in Section  7.1(b)  should not be  obtained  without the
imposition  of any condition of the type  referred to in Section  7.1(b).  First
National  is in  material  compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of the
Community Reinvestment Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and First
National  currently has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better. To the knowledge
of FNB, there is no fact or circumstance or set of facts or  circumstances  that
would cause First  National to fail to comply with such  provisions or cause the
rating of First National to fall below satisfactory.

         (i) Labor  Relations.  None of the FNB  Companies  is a party to, or is
bound by any collective  bargaining  agreement,  contract or other  agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is it the subject of
a proceeding  asserting that is has committed an unfair labor  practice  (within
the  meaning of the  National  Labor  Relations  Act) or seeking to compel it to
bargain with any labor  organization  as to wages and  conditions of employment,
nor is there any strike or other labor dispute  involving it, pending or, to the
best of its knowledge, threatened, nor is it aware of any activity involving its
employees  seeking to certify a  collective  bargaining  unit or engaging in any
other organizational activity.

         (j) Tax Matters.  The FNB Companies have filed all federal,  state, and
local tax returns and reports  required to be filed, and all taxes shown by such
returns to be due and payable have been paid or are  reflected as a liability in
the FNB Financial  Statements or are being contested in good faith and have been
Previously  Disclosed.  Except  to the  extent  that  liabilities  therefor  are
specifically  reflected in the FNB Financial  Statements,  there are no federal,
state or local tax liabilities of the FNB Companies other than  liabilities that
have arisen since December 31, 2001, all of which have been properly  accrued or
otherwise provided for on the books and records of the FNB Companies.  Except as
Previously  Disclosed,  no tax return or report of any of the FNB  Companies  is
under  examination by any taxing authority or the subject of any  administrative
or judicial  proceeding,  and no unpaid tax deficiency has been asserted against
any of the FNB Companies by any taxing authority.

         (k)  Property.  Except as  disclosed  or  reserved  against  in the FNB
Financial  Statements,  all of the FNB Companies have good and marketable  title
free  and  clear of all  material  liens,  encumbrances,  charges,  defaults  or
equities of whatever  character  to all of the material  properties  and assets,
tangible or intangible, reflected in the FNB Financial Statements as being owned
by the FNB Companies as of the dates thereof.  To the best knowledge of FNB, all
buildings, and all fixtures,  equipment, and other property and assets which are
material to its business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases
by the FNB Companies are held under valid instruments  enforceable in accordance
with  their  respective  terms,  subject  to  bankruptcy,   insolvency,  merger,
moratorium and similar laws. The buildings, structures, and

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

appurtenances  owned,  leased, or occupied by the FNB Companies are, to the best
knowledge of FNB, in good operating  condition,  in a state of good  maintenance
and repair and (i) comply with  applicable  zoning and other  municipal laws and
regulations, and (ii) there are no latent defects therein.

         (l) Reports.  Since January 1, 2000,  the FNB Companies  have filed all
reports and  statements,  together with any amendments  required to be made with
respect  thereto,  that were  required  to be filed with the OCC,  the SEC,  the
Federal Reserve,  the SCC, and any other governmental or regulatory authority or
agency having jurisdiction over their operations.

         (m) Employee Benefit Plans and Other Compensatory Arrangements.  (1) As
soon as  practicable,  FNB will  provide a summary for BBI, or deliver for BBI's
review  true  and  complete  copies,  of  all  material   pension,   retirement,
profit-sharing,  deferred  compensation,  stock option, bonus, vacation or other
material  incentive plans or agreements,  all material medical,  dental or other
health plans, all cafeteria or flexible benefits plans, all life insurance plans
and all other material  employee  compensation,  benefit plans or fringe benefit
plans and any related  trust or other  funding  instrument,  including,  without
limitation, all "employee benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3)
of the ERISA,  currently  adopted,  maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part
by, or contributed to by FNB or any FNB Subsidiary for the benefit of current or
former  employees,  retirees  or other  beneficiaries  eligible  to  participate
(collectively, the "FNB Benefit Plans").

         (2) No FNB  Benefit  Plan is or has  been a  "multiemployer  plan,"  as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

         (3) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  all FNB Benefit  Plans,  and the
reporting  and  disclosure  relating  thereto,  are in compliance in form and in
operation with the applicable  terms of ERISA, the IRC, and any other applicable
laws,  rules and  regulations the breach or violation of which could result in a
material  liability  to FNB on a  consolidated  basis.  In the  case of any plan
intended  to  be  qualified   under  IRC  Section  401,   compliance  with  such
qualification requirements shall mean the timely adoption of all plan amendments
and the receipt of a current,  favorable  determination letter from the Internal
Revenue  Service  based on laws  changes  effective  through  2001 for which the
remedial  amendment  period under  Section  401(b) of the Code has ended and the
operation of the plan in  accordance  with its terms or in  accordance  with any
subsequently  enacted law for which such remedial  amendment period for adopting
plan amendments has not yet ended.

         (4) No FNB ERISA Plan which is subject to the minimum funding standards
of Section 302 of ERISA or IRC Section 412 has any "unfunded current liability,"
as that term is defined in Section  302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA,  and the present fair
market value of the assets of any such plan which is a "defined  benefit  plan,"
as that term is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA,  exceeds the plan's  "benefit
liabilities,"  as that term is  defined in Section  4001(a)(16)  of ERISA,  when
determined  under actuarial  factors that would apply if the plan was terminated
in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.

         (n)  Investment  Securities.  Except for  pledges to secure  public and
trust deposits and obligations under agreements pursuant to which any of the FNB
Companies has sold  securities  subject to an obligation to repurchase,  none of
the investment  securities  reflected in the FNB Financial Statements is subject
to any restriction,  contractual,  statutory,  or otherwise,  which would impair
materially the ability of the holder of such investment to dispose freely of any
such investment at any time.

         (o) Certain Contracts. (1) Except as Previously Disclosed,  neither FNB
nor  any  FNB  subsidiary  is a party  to,  or is  bound  by,  (i) any  material
agreement,  arrangement  or commitment,  (ii) any agreement,  indenture or other
instrument  relating to the  borrowing of money by FNB or any FNB  Subsidiary or
the  guarantee by FNB or any FNB  Subsidiary of any such  obligation,  (iii) any
agreement,  arrangement or commitment relating to the employment of a consultant
or the employment,  election, retention in office or severance of any present or
former  director  or  officer,  (iv)  any  agreement  to make  loans  or for the
provision,  purchase or sale of goods,  services or property  between FNB or any
FNB Subsidiary and any director or officer of FNB or any FNB Subsidiary,  or any
member of the immediate family or affiliate of any of the foregoing,  or (v) any
agreement  between FNB or any FNB Subsidiary  and any 5% or more  shareholder of
FNB; in each case other than  agreements  entered into in the ordinary course of
the banking business of FNB or a FNB Subsidiary consistent with past practice.

         (2) Neither FNB or any FNB Subsidiary, nor to the knowledge of FNB, the
other party  thereto,  is in default under any material  agreement,  commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument whether entered into in
the ordinary  course of business or otherwise,  nor has there occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both,  would constitute such
a default, other than defaults of loan agreements by borrowers from FNB or a FNB
Subsidiary in the ordinary course of its business.

         (p)  Insurance.  A complete  list of all  policies  or binders of fire,
liability,  product  liability,  workmen's  compensation,  vehicular  and  other
insurance  held  by or on  behalf  of the  FNB  Companies  has  previously  been
furnished to BBI and all such policies or binders are valid and  enforceable  in
accordance  with their terms,  are in full force and effect,  and insure against
risks and liabilities to the extent and in the manner customary for the industry
and are deemed  appropriate  and sufficient by FNB. The FNB Companies are not in
default with respect to any provision contained in any such policy or binder and
have not failed to give any notice or present any claim under any such policy or
binder in due and timely fashion.  None of the FNB Companies has received notice
of  cancellation  or non-renewal  of any such policy or binder.  None of the FNB
Companies has knowledge of any inaccuracy in any  application  for such policies
or binders,  any failure to pay premiums  when due or any similar state of facts
or the  occurrence of any event that is reasonably  likely to form the basis for
any material  claim  against it not fully  covered  (except to the extent of any
applicable deductible) by the policies or binders referred to above. None of the
FNB  Companies has received  notice from any of its insurance  carriers that any
insurance  premiums will be increased  materially in the future or that any such
insurance coverage will not be available in the future on substantially the same
terms as now in effect.

         (q)  Loans,  OREO,  and  Allowance  for  Loan  Losses.  (1)  Except  as
Previously  Disclosed,  and  except for  matters  which  individually  or in the
aggregate,  do not  materially  adversely  affect  the  Merger or the  financial
condition of FNB, to FNB's best knowledge each loan reflected as an asset in the
FNB Financial  Statements or the financial  statements of any FNB Subsidiary (i)
is evidenced by notes, agreements,  or other evidences of indebtedness which are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured,  has been
secured by valid liens and security  interests  which have been  perfected,  and
(iii) is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, and
other laws of general  applicability  relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity  principles.  All loans and extensions of credit which are
subject to regulation of the Federal Reserve which have been made by FNB and the
FNB Subsidiaries comply therewith.

         (2) The  classification  on the books and  records  of FNB and each FNB
Subsidiary of loans and/or  non-performing  assets as nonaccrual,  troubled debt
restructuring,  OREO or other similar  classification,  complies in all material
respects with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable regulatory
accounting principles.

         (3) Except for liens,  security  interests,  claims,  charges,  or such
other encumbrances as have been appropriately  reserved for in the FNB Financial
Statements or are not material,  title to the OREO is good and  marketable,  and
there are no adverse claims or encumbrances  on the OREO. All title,  hazard and
other  insurance  claims and mortgage  guaranty  claims with respect to the OREO
have been timely filed and neither FNB nor any FNB  Subsidiary has been received
any notice of denial of any such claim.

         (4) FNB and each FNB  Subsidiary  are in  possession of all of the OREO
or, if any of the OREO remains  occupied by the  mortgagor,  eviction or summary
proceedings  have been  commenced or rental  arrangements  providing  for market
rental  rates have been  agreed  upon and FNB  and/or  each FNB  Subsidiary  are
diligently  pursuing  such  eviction  of  summary  proceedings  or  such  rental
arrangements. Except as Previously Disclosed, no legal proceeding or quasi-legal
proceeding  is  pending  or, to the  knowledge  of FNB and each FNB  Subsidiary,
threatened  concerning any OREO or any servicing activity or omission to provide
a servicing activity with respect to any of the OREO.

         (5) Except as  Previously  Disclosed,  all loans made by any of the FNB
Companies to facilitate  the  disposition  of OREO are  performing in accordance
with their terms.

         (6) The  allowance  for possible loan losses shown on the FNB Financial
Statements  was,  and the  allowance  for  possible  loan  losses  shown  on the
financial  statements  of FNB as of dates  subsequent  to the  execution of this
Agreement  will  be,  in each  case as of the  dates  thereof,  adequate  in all
material respects to provide for possible losses, net of recoveries  relating to
loans previously  charged off, on loans outstanding  (including accrued interest
receivable)  of the FNB  Companies  and other  extensions  of credit  (including
letters of credit and commitments to make loans or extend credit) by FNB.

         (r) Absence of Material  Changes and Events.  Since  December 31, 2002,
(i) the FNB Companies have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
and usual course consistent with past practices,  and (ii) no event has occurred
or circumstance  arisen that, in the aggregate,  has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the FNB Companies.

         (s) Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied or to
be  supplied  by FNB for  inclusion  in the  Registration  Statement,  the proxy
statement/prospectus or any other document to be filed with the SEC or any other
regulatory  authority in connection with the transactions  contemplated  hereby,
will, at the respective  time such documents are filed,  and, in the case of the
Registration Statement,  when it becomes effective and with respect to the proxy
statement/prospectus,  when  first  mailed  to BBI  shareholders,  be  false  or
misleading  with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the  statements  therein not  misleading,  or, in the
case of the proxy statement/prospectus or any supplement thereto, at the time of
the  BBI  Shareholders'  Meeting  or FNB  Shareholders'  Meeting,  be  false  or
misleading  with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier  communication with respect to
the solicitation of any proxy for the BBI Shareholders'  Meeting.  All documents
that  FNB is  responsible  for  filing  with  the  SEC or any  other  regulatory
authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as
to  form in all  material  respects  with  the  provisions  of  applicable  law,
including applicable provisions of federal and state securities law.

         (t) Brokers and Finders. Neither FNB nor any FNB Subsidiary, nor any of
their  respective  officers,  directors or  employees,  has employed any broker,
finder  or  financial  advisor  or  incurred  any  liability  for  any  fees  or
commissions in connection with the transactions  contemplated herein, except for
The Carson Medlin Company.

         (u) Repurchase  Agreements.  With respect to all agreements pursuant to
which FNB or any FNB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement
to resell, if any, FNB or such FNB Subsidiary,  as the case may be, has a valid,
perfected first lien or security interest in the government  securities or other
collateral securing the repurchase  agreement,  and the value of such collateral
equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

         (v)  Administration  of Trust Accounts.  FNB and FNB Subsidiaries  have
properly  administered,  in all respects  material and which could reasonably be
expected to be material to the business,  operations  or financial  condition of
FNB and FNB  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, all accounts for which they act as
fiduciaries  including  but not  limited  to  accounts  for which  they serve as
trustees, agents, custodians, personal representatives,  guardians, conservators
or investment advisors,  in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable  state and federal law and regulation and common law. Neither FNB
nor a FNB  Subsidiary,  nor any  director,  officer or  employee of FNB or a FNB
Subsidiary  has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary
account  which is material to or could  reasonably be expected to be material to
the  business,  operations or financial  condition of FNB, or a FNB  Subsidiary,
taken as a whole,  and the accountings for each such fiduciary  account are true
and correct in all material  respects and accurately  reflect the assets of such
fiduciary account in all material respects.

         (w) Environmental  Matters. (1) Except as Previously Disclosed,  to the
best of FNB's  knowledge,  neither FNB nor any FNB Subsidiary owns or leases any
properties  affected by toxic waste, radon gas or other hazardous  conditions or
constructed  in  part  with  the  use of  asbestos.  Each  of FNB  and  the  FNB
Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable
to real or personal  properties  in which it has a direct fee ownership or, with
respect to a direct interest as lessee, applicable to the leasehold premises or,
to the best knowledge of FNB and the FNB Subsidiaries, the premises on which the
leasehold  is  situated.  Neither FNB nor any FNB  Subsidiary  has  received any
Communication alleging that FNB or such FNB Subsidiary is not in such compliance
and, to the best knowledge of FNB and the FNB Subsidiaries, there are no present
circumstances  (including  Environmental Laws that have been adopted but are not
yet  effective)  that would prevent or interfere with the  continuation  of such
compliance.

         (2) There  are no  legal,  administrative,  arbitral  or other  claims,
causes  of action or  governmental  investigations  of any  nature,  seeking  to
impose, or that could result in the imposition,  on FNB and the FNB Subsidiaries
of any liability  arising under any  Environmental  Laws pending or, to the best
knowledge of FNB and the FNB Subsidiaries, threatened against (A) FNB or any FNB
Subsidiary,  (B) any  person or entity  whose  liability  for any  Environmental
Claim,  FNB or any FNB  Subsidiary  has or may have  retained or assumed  either
contractually or by operation of law, or (C) any real or personal property which
FNB or any FNB  Subsidiary  owns or  leases,  or has been or is  judged  to have
managed or to have  supervised  or  participated  in the  management  of,  which
liability  might  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  business,  financial
condition or results of operations of FNB. FNB and the FNB  Subsidiaries are not
subject to any agreement,  order, judgment,  decree or memorandum by or with any
court,  governmental  authority,  regulatory  agency or third party imposing any
such liability.

         (3) To the best knowledge of FNB and the FNB Subsidiaries, there are no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, or Environmental Claims or
other claims,  causes of action or  governmental  investigations  of any nature,
seeking to impose,  or that could  result in the  imposition,  on FNB or any FNB
Subsidiary of any  liability  arising  under any  Environmental  Laws pending or
threatened  against  any  real or  personal  property  in  which  FNB or any FNB
Subsidiary  holds  a  security  interest  in  connection  with a loan  or a loan
participation  which  liability  might  have a  material  adverse  effect on the
business,  financial  condition or results of operations of FNB. FNB and the FNB
Subsidiaries  are not  subject  to any  agreement,  order,  judgment,  decree or
memorandum by or with any court,  governmental  authority,  regulatory agency or
third party imposing any such liability.

         (4) With respect to all real and personal  property  owned or leased by
FNB or any FNB Subsidiary, other than OREO, FNB has made available to BBI copies
of any  environmental  audits,  analyses  and  surveys  that have been  prepared
relating  to such  properties.  With  respect to all OREO held by FNB or any FNB
Subsidiary and all real or personal property which FNB or any FNB Subsidiary has
been or is judged to have managed or to have  supervised or  participated in the
management  of, FNB has made available to BBI the  information  relating to such
OREO  available to FNB. FNB and the FNB  Subsidiaries  are in  compliance in all
material


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

respects  with  all  recommendations  contained  in  any  environmental  audits,
analyses  and  surveys  relating  to any of the  properties,  real or  personal,
described in this subsection (4).

         (5) There are no past or present  actions,  activities,  circumstances,
conditions,  events or incidents,  including,  without limitation,  the release,
emission,  discharge or disposal of any Materials of Environmental Concern, that
could  reasonably  form the basis of any  Environmental  Claim or other claim or
action or governmental  investigation that could result in the imposition of any
liability  arising under any  Environmental  Laws currently in effect or adopted
but not yet effective against FNB or any FNB Subsidiary or against any person or
entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim FNB or any FNB Subsidiary has
or may have  retained or assumed  either  contractually  or by operation of law.
Neither  FNB,  nor any FNB  subsidiary,  nor any of their  respective  officers,
directors,  and employees,  will take any action that would result in the Merger
not constituting a tax free transaction within the meaning of Section 368 of the
IRC.

         (x) Investment  Banking  Letter.  FNB has received a written opinion in
form and substance  satisfactory to FNB from The Carson Medlin Company addressed
to FNB,  which opinion is dated as of the date of the  Agreement,  to the effect
that the terms of the Merger,  including the Exchange  Ratio,  are fair,  from a
financial point of view, to FNB.


                                    ARTICLE 5
                       Conduct Prior to the Effective Date

         5.1 Access to Records and  Properties.  BBI will keep FNB, and FNB will
keep BBI  advised of all  material  developments  relevant  to their  respective
businesses  prior to  consummation  of the Merger.  Prior to the Effective Date,
FNB,  on the one hand,  and BBI on the other,  agree to give to the other  party
reasonable  access to all the  premises  and books and  records  (including  tax
returns filed and those in preparation) of it and its  subsidiaries and to cause
its officers to furnish the other with such  financial  and  operating  data and
other information with respect to the business and properties as the other shall
from time to time  request for the  purposes of  verifying  the  warranties  and
representations set forth herein; provided, however, that any such investigation
shall be  conducted  in such manner as not to  interfere  unreasonably  with the
operation of the respective business of the other.

         5.2  Confidentiality.  Between  the  date  of  this  Agreement  and the
Effective  Date,  FNB and BBI each will  maintain in  confidence,  and cause its
directors,  officers,  employees, agents and advisors to maintain in confidence,
and not use to the  detriment  of the other party,  any  written,  oral or other
information  obtained  in  confidence  from the other  party or a third party in
connection with this Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby unless
such information is already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty
of confidentiality or unless such information becomes publicly available through
no  fault  of  such  party,  unless  use of such  information  is  necessary  or
appropriate  in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval  required
for the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or unless  the
furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or appropriate
in connection

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

with legal proceedings. If the Merger is not consummated, each party will return
or destroy as much of such written information as may reasonably be requested.

         5.3 Registration  Statement,  Proxy Statement and Shareholder Approval.
The  Board of  Directors  of BBI and FNB each  will  duly  call and will  hold a
meeting of their respective  shareholders as soon as practicable for the purpose
of  approving  the  Merger  (the  "BBI  Shareholders'   Meeting"  and  the  "FNB
Shareholders' Meeting,"  respectively);  and, subject to the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of BBI and of FNB (as advised in writing by its counsel),
BBI and FNB each shall use its best  efforts to solicit and obtain  votes of the
holders of its Common  Stock in favor of the  Merger  and will  comply  with the
provisions in their respective  Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws relating to
the call and holding of a meeting of shareholders for such purpose.  BBI and FNB
each will use its best  efforts  to  deliver  to the other  party a  certificate
signed by each member of its respective  Board of Directors with respect to that
member's  voting of shares at a meeting of stockholders to approve the Agreement
(such  certificate being in the form attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement) as
of the date of  execution of this  Agreement,  and BBI and FNB each will use its
best efforts to facilitate that each member of the Board of Directors of BBI and
FNB shall vote all shares of BBI Common  Stock and FNB Common Stock under his or
her control (and not held in a fiduciary  capacity) in favor of the Merger;  and
BBI and FNB each shall,  subject to its fiduciary duty, at the other's  request,
recess or adjourn  the meeting if such  recess or  adjournment  is deemed by the
other to be necessary or desirable.  FNB and BBI will prepare  jointly the proxy
statement/prospectus to be used in connection with the BBI Shareholders' Meeting
and the FNB  Shareholders'  Meeting  (the  "Joint  Proxy  Statement").  FNB will
prepare and file with the SEC the  Registration  Statement,  of which such Joint
Proxy  Statement  shall be a part and  will  use its  best  efforts  to have the
Registration  Statement  declared  effective as promptly as  possible.  When the
Registration  Statement or any  post-effective  amendment or supplement  thereto
shall become effective, and at all times subsequent to such effectiveness, up to
and  including  the date of the Meetings,  such  Registration  Statement and all
amendments or supplements  thereto,  with respect to all  information  set forth
therein furnished or to be furnished by BBI relating to the BBI Companies and by

         (5) Incur any obligation or liability  (whether absolute or contingent,

         (9) Alter, amend or repeal its Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation;

         (10)   Propose  or  take  any  other   action   which  would  make  any

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

Bedford Federal Pension Plan (as defined in Section 6.2(e)), provided,  however,
contributions  to the  Bedford  Federal  ESOP  needed to service  the  scheduled
principal and interest payments on the Bedford Federal ESOP  indebtedness  prior
to the Effective Date (after taking into account  dividends on unallocated  ESOP
shares which may be used to service such  indebtedness) may in any event be made
consistent  with past  practices,  and provided,  further,  in  accordance  with
Section  6.2(c)  herein,  as of the  Effective  Date  or as soon  thereafter  as
practical  assets  attributable  to unallocated BBI shares held as collateral on
the  Bedford  Federal  ESOP  indebtedness   shall  be  utilized  to  repay  such
indebtedness  and the remaining  assets  attributable  to such  unallocated  BBI
shares  shall be allocated in  accordance  with Section  6.2(c) and the terms of
such Bedford Federal ESOP.

         5.5  Dividends.  BBI may declare and pay only  regular  quarterly  cash
dividends  in the ordinary  course of business  consistent  with past  practice,

through the Effective  Date,  provided that any dividend  declared or payable on
the  shares  of BBI  Common  Stock in the  quarterly  period  during  which  the
Effective  Date occurs  shall,  unless agreed upon in writing by FNB and BBI, be
declared  with a record  date  prior to the  Effective  Date only if the  normal
record date for payment of the  corresponding  quarterly  dividend to holders of
FNB Common Stock is before the Effective Date.

         5.6 No  Solicitation.  Without the prior  written  consent of FNB,  BBI
shall  not,  and shall  cause its  officers,  directors,  agents,  advisors  and
affiliates not to,  solicit or encourage  inquires or proposals with respect to,
furnish any  information  relating to, or  participate  in any  negotiations  or
discussions  concerning,  an Acquisition  Transaction (as hereinafter  defined);
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 5.6 shall prohibit the
Board of  Directors  of BBI from  furnishing  information  to, or entering  into
discussions  or   negotiations   with,  any  person  or  entity  that  makes  an
unsolicited, written bona fide proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction if,
and only to the extent that (A) the Board of Directors of BBI  concludes in good
faith,  after  consultation  with and  consideration  of the  written  advice of
outside counsel, that the failure to furnish such information or enter into such
discussions or negotiations would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
shareholders  under  applicable  law,  and (B) the  Board  of  Directors  of BBI
concludes in good faith that the proposal regarding the Acquisition  Transaction
contains an offer of  consideration  that is superior to the  consideration  set
forth  herein.  BBI shall  immediately  notify  FNB orally and in writing of its
receipt  of any such  proposal  or  inquiry.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" means any merger, consolidation, share exchange, joint
venture,  business  combination or similar transaction or any purchase of all or
any material portion of the assets of an entity.

         5.7  Regulatory  Filings.   FNB  and  BBI  shall  prepare  jointly  all
regulatory  filings required to consummate the transactions  contemplated by the
Agreement  and the Plan of Merger and submit the filings for  approval  with the
OTS, the Federal Reserve Board and the SCC, and any other  governing  regulatory
authority,  as soon as practicable after the date hereof.  FNB and BBI shall use
their best efforts to obtain approvals of such filings.

         5.8 Public Announcements. Each party will consult with the other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect
to the Merger and shall

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultations except as may be required by law.

         5.9 Notice of Breach. FNB and BBI will give written notice to the other
promptly  upon becoming  aware of the impending or threatened  occurrence of any
events which would cause or  constitute a breach of any of the  representations,
warranties or covenants  made to the other party in this  Agreement and will use
its best efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.

         5.10  Accounting  Treatment.  FNB and BBI  acknowledge  that the Merger
shall  be  accounted  for as a  purchase  under  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

         5.11 Merger  Consummation.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party shall use its best efforts in good faith to take, or cause
to be taken,  all actions,  and to do or cause to be done all things  necessary,
proper or  desirable,  or  advisable  under  applicable  laws,  as  promptly  as
practicable so as to permit  consummation of the Merger at the earliest possible
date,  consistent with Section 1.5 herein, and to otherwise enable  consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with the other
parties  hereto to that end,  and each of FNB and BBI shall use, and shall cause
each of their  respective  subsidiaries  to use,  its best efforts to obtain all
consents  (governmental or other) necessary or desirable for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.12 FNB Acquisition  Transaction.  Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall  prevent FNB from entering into an  Acquisition  Transaction  with a third
party so long as FNB and its successors comply with the terms of the Merger with
BBI.

         5.13 Affiliate Agreements. BBI shall use its best efforts to cause each
director,  executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" of BBI under
Rule 145 of the  Securities  Act to deliver to FNB as soon as  practicable,  and
prior to the  mailing  of the  proxy  statement/prospectus,  executed  affiliate
agreements in the form of Exhibit B attached  hereto  providing that such person
will comply with Rule 145 and will vote in favor of the Merger.

         5.14 Exchange  Listing.  FNB shall use its  reasonable  best efforts to
list, prior to the Effective Date, on the NASDAQ  Exchange,  subject to official
notice of  issuance,  the shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued to the holders
of BBI Common Stock  pursuant to the Merger;  and FNB shall give all notices and
make all  filings  with  NASDAQ  required  in  connection  with the  transaction
contemplated herein.

                              Additional Agreements

         6.1 Conversion of Stock Options. BBI agrees to use its best efforts and
to exercise all of its discretionary powers, as well as to cause the "Committee"
under its 1994 Stock Option Plan,  to prevent the exercise of any stock  options
outstanding on or after the date of this Agreement  (other than incentive  stock
options  described  in Section  422 of the IRC) and to cash out all  unexercised
outstanding  stock  options  pursuant to Section  13(b) of the 1994 Stock Option


                                      -31-

<PAGE>

Plan no later than the Effective  Date. On the Effective  Date,  all rights with
respect to BBI Common Stock pursuant to stock options ("BBI Options") granted by
BBI in compliance  herewith under a BBI stock option plan which are  outstanding
on the Effective Date,  whether or not they are exercisable,  shall be exchanged
for cash paid by BBI on the Effective  Date in an amount by which the applicable
Cash  Consideration per share of BBI Common Stock (determined in accordance with
Section 2.1) exceeds the BBI Option exercise price.

         6.2  Benefit Plans.

         (a) Effective with the consummation of the Merger, the Management Stock
Bonus Plan and any and all stock option plans of BBI and Bedford  Federal  shall
be  terminated   and  all  unawarded   shares  (and  the  Merger   Consideration
attributable  thereto)  shall be  forfeited.  In addition,  the Bedford  Federal
health and dental plans, long term disability plan, and term life insurance plan
shall be continued  through  December 31, 2004; the Bedford Federal vacation and
sick leave plans shall be continued  through  December 31, 2004  (subject to the
modification  noted below regarding  cashouts of unused vacation on cessation of
employment);  the Bedford  Federal ESOP (as defined in Section  6.2(c)) shall be
amended,   continued  and  merged  as  provided   Section   6.2(c)  below;   and
participation  in FNB's Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan and 401(k) plan shall be
made available to all Bedford Federal  eligible  employees no later than January
1, 2005 as provided  Section  6.2(c) and (d),  respectively,  below.  Also,  the
Bedford  Federal Pension Plan (as defined in Section 6.2(e)) shall be amended to
provide for full vesting as of the Effective  Date and shall be terminated at or
after the Effective Date as provided in Section 6.2(e). Finally, unused vacation
accrued as of the Effective  Date shall be cashed out at cessation of employment
under Bedford Federal's  vacation payment policy in effect at the Effective Date
as provided in Section 6.2(f) for one year after the Effective Date.  Otherwise,
after  consummation of the Merger, at the option of FNB (which may be applied on
a plan or program by plan or program  basis) and subject to FNB's best  efforts,
employees of Bedford Federal shall be entitled to participate  either (x) in one
or more combined plans or programs of FNB and Bedford  Federal on  substantially
the same basis as similarly  situated employees of FNB or First National (taking
into  account all  applicable  factors,  including  but not limited to position,
employment  classification,  age, length of service, pay, part time or full time
status,  and the like, as well as changes made in such plans and programs in the
future),  or (y) in plans and  programs  which,  subject to changes  required by
applicable laws or by limitations  imposed by insurance companies providing plan
benefits,   are  comparable  to  (or  a   continuation   of),  and  provide  for
participation on  substantially  the same basis, as Bedford  Federal's  employee
benefit plans and programs  currently in effect. If and to the extent option (x)
is effectuated:

         (1) (A) Coverage  under FNB's plans and programs  shall be available to
each employee of Bedford  Federal and, where  applicable,  his or her dependents
without regard to any waiting period,  evidence or requirement of  insurability,
actively at work  requirement or preexisting  condition  exclusion or limitation
(except to the extent and in the manner any such  waiting  period,  evidence  or
requirement  of  insurability,  actively at work  requirement  or  exclusion  or
limitation  applies to such  employee  or  dependents  immediately  prior to the
effectuation  of option (x)) and (B) amounts  paid or payable by  employees  for
health care


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

expenses  for any portion of the annual  benefit  period prior to the date as of
which  option (x) becomes  effective  shall be credited in  satisfaction  of any
deductible requirement and any out-of-pocket limit for the balance of the annual
benefit period which includes such date.

         (2) FNB shall treat  service  with BBI and Bedford  Federal  before the
consummation  of the Merger as service with FNB for purposes of  eligibility  to
begin participation and vesting (but not benefit accruals, except in the case of
a continuation of any plan maintained by BBI or Bedford Federal) for purposes of
all employee  benefit and seniority based plans and programs,  including but not
limited to annual,  sick and personal leave accruing  following the consummation
of the Merger.

         Nothing  contained  in this  Section is  intended  to provide any third
party  beneficiary  rights in any current or former  employee,  or any spouse or
dependent thereof, of BBI, Bedford Federal, FNB or any FNB Subsidiary, except as
otherwise  required by ERISA or other applicable law (determined  without regard
to third party beneficiary contract law).

         (b) Except to extent individually  negotiated  replacement contracts or
settlement   agreements  are  entered  into,  FNB  shall  honor  all  employment
severance, consulting and other compensation contracts and agreements Previously
Disclosed  and  executed  in writing  by BBI on the one hand and any  individual
current or former  director,  officer  or  employee  thereof on the other  hand,
copies of which have been previously delivered by BBI to FNB.

         (c) Effective with the consummation of the Merger,  the ESOP loan under
the Bedford  Federal  Savings Bank Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan (the "Bedford
Federal  ESOP") shall be paid off at or shortly after the Effective  Date by use
of the Merger  Consideration  attributable to unallocated BBI shares held by the
Bedford Federal ESOP trust to satisfy the then outstanding  Bedford Federal ESOP
loan, the balance of the Merger  Consideration  attributable to such unallocated
BBI shares  shall be allocated to  participants  in the Bedford  Federal ESOP as
earnings on trust  assets in  accordance  with the terms of the Bedford  Federal
ESOP allocation  provisions in effect as of the date of this Agreement (subject,
however,  to such changes,  if any, as may be required by applicable  law),  the
Bedford Federal ESOP accrued  benefits of all Bedford Federal ESOP  participants
who are BBI or Bedford  Federal  employees at the Effective  Date shall be fully
vested,  and the Bedford Federal ESOP shall be continued on an unleveraged basis
and then merged into the FNB Employee Stock Ownership Plan no later than January
1, 2005, with participation in the FNB Employee Stock Ownership Plan extended to
eligible  employees of Bedford  Federal as of the time of such plan merger.  FNB
shall treat service with BBI and Bedford Federal before the  consummation of the
Merger as service with FNB for purposes of eligibility  to begin  participation,
vesting and future benefit  accrual under its Employee Stock  Ownership Plan. In
addition,  FNB agrees to cause  Bedford  Federal to make a  contribution  to the
Bedford  Federal  ESOP for the 2004  calendar  year in an  amount  equal to five
percent  (5%) of covered pay  thereunder  (or, if the  Bedford  Federal  ESOP is
merged into FNB's  Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan prior to December 31, 2004, a
pro rata  contribution  for the  portion  of such  year  prior to any such  plan
merger).


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

         (d)   Effective  no  later  than  January  1,  2005,   FNB  shall  make
participation in its 401(k) plan available to the eligible  employees of Bedford
Federal.  FNB shall  treat  service  with BBI and  Bedford  Federal  before  the
consummation  of the Merger as service with FNB for purposes of  eligibility  to
begin participation, vesting and future benefit accrual under its 401(k) plan.

         (e) Effective with the consummation of the Merger, the accrued benefits
under the Bedford Federal Savings Bank Money Purchase Pension Plan (the "Bedford
Federal Pension Plan") of all Bedford Federal Pension Plan  participants who are
BBI or Bedford  Federal  employees at the Effective  Date shall be fully vested,
and the  Bedford  Federal  Pension  Plan  shall be  terminated  at or about  the
Effective  Date.  Bedford  Federal  agrees to give timely notice of the proposed
termination  of  the  Bedford   Federal   Pension  Plan  to   participants   and
beneficiaries entitled to plan benefits effective contingent on the consummation
of the Merger and as of, or at a date after, the Effective Date as determined by
FNB.

         (f) Vacation accrued as of the Effective Date and unused (determined by
first using any vacation accrued at the Effective Date) at the date of cessation
of employment of any BBI or Bedford Federal  employee  employed at the Effective
Date shall be cashed out in accordance with Bedford  Federal's  vacation cashout
policy in effect at the Effective Date (which policy shall remain unchanged from
the  policy  in  effect  at the date of this  Agreement  without  FNB's  written
consent) in the event of such BBI or Bedford  Federal  employee's  cessation  of
employment with FNB and its affiliates within one year after the Effective Date.
Any other accrued and unused vacation will be forfeited in accordance with FNB's
vacation policy.

         6.3 Indemnification.  Following the Effective Date, FNB shall indemnify
and hold harmless any person who has rights to indemnification  from BBI, to the
maximum  extent  permitted  under  Virginia  law and in  accordance  with  BBI's
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
to the extent legally  permitted to do so, with respect to matters  occurring on
or prior to the Effective  Date. FNB further agrees that any such person who has
rights to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3 is expressly made a third
party  beneficiary  of  this  Section  6.3 and may  directly,  in such  person's
personal capacity,  enforce such rights through an action at law or in equity or
through any other manner or means of redress allowable under Virginia law to the
same  extent  as if  such  person  were a party  hereto.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing, in any case in which corporate approval may be required to effectuate
any  indemnification,  FNB  shall  direct,  at the  election  of the party to be
indemnified,  that the determination of permissibility of indemnification  shall
be  made  by  independent  counsel  mutually  agreed  upon  between  FNB and the
indemnified party. Upon written application,  and in accordance with, and to the
extent permitted by, Virginia law, FNB will advance  reasonable  expenses to any
person who has rights to indemnification  from BBI. FNB shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain  BBI's  existing  directors'  and  officers'  liability
policy,  or some other policy,  including  FNB's existing  policy,  providing at
least comparable  coverage,  covering persons who are currently  covered by such
insurance  of BBI for a period of 5 years after the  Effective  Date on terms no
less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof.

         6.4 Continuation of Bedford Directors.  Bedford Directors continuing to
serve for a minimum  period of 36 months from the  Effective  Date shall receive
monthly  fees in the same

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

amount as those paid to them as of December  31,  2002.  Bedford  Directors  not
continuing to serve for a minimum  period of 36 months from the  Effective  Date
shall be  appointed as an advisory  director for a period  ending 36 months from
the Effective  Date and shall  receive  monthly fees in the same amount as those
having been paid by Bedford Federal as of December 31, 2002. As of the Effective
Date,  any  Bedford  Emeritus  Director  shall  continue  to serve as a emeritus
director for the remainder of their one year term.

         7.1 Conditions to Each Party's  Obligations  to Effect the Merger.  The
respective obligations of each of FNB and BBI to effect the Merger and the other

approved all matters  relating to this  Agreement and the Merger  required to be
approved by such shareholders in accordance with Virginia law.

         (b) Regulatory  Approvals.  This Agreement and the Plan of Merger shall
have  been  approved  by the  Federal  Reserve,  the SCC,  the  Office of Thrift
Supervision  and any other  regulatory  authority whose approval is required for
consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby, and such approvals shall
not have  imposed  any  condition  or  requirement  which  would  so  materially
adversely  impact  the  economic  or  business   benefits  of  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as to render  inadvisable the consummation of the
Merger in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of FNB or BBI.

         (c) Registration Statement.  The Registration Statement shall have been
declared  effective  and shall not be subject to a stop order or any  threatened
stop order.

         (d) Tax Opinion. FNB and BBI shall have received an opinion of Troutman
Sanders LLP, or other  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to FNB and BBI, to the
effect that the Merger will  constitute  a merger  within the meaning of Section
368 of the IRC and that no gain or loss will be recognized  by the  shareholders
of BBI to the extent they  receive FNB Common Stock solely in exchange for their
BBI Common Stock in the Merger.

         (e) Opinions of Counsel.  BBI shall have delivered to FNB and FNB shall
have delivered to BBI opinions of counsel, dated as of the Effective Date, as to

to each of them.

eliminate the provisions  thereof requiring full vesting of accrued benefits due
to  consummation  of the Merger (except as otherwise  provided in Section 6.2(c)
hereof) and termination of such plan on the  consummation of a transaction  such
as  the  Merger.  The  provisions  of  the  Bedford  Federal  ESOP  relating  to
satisfaction  of any  acquisition  loan and  allocation to  participants  of the
remaining value of collateral not used to satisfy any acquisition  loan need not
be revised.

         (h) Notice of  Termination  of the Bedford  Pension Plan.  Prior to the
Merger,  if requested by FNB,  Bedford Federal shall have given timely notice of
the  proposed  termination  of the Bedford  Federal  Pension Plan (as defined in

effective  contingent on the  consummation of the Merger and as of, or at a date
after, the Effective Date as determined by FNB.

warranties  contained  herein of BBI shall be true and  correct in all  material
respects as of the date of this  Agreement and upon the Effective  Date with the
same effect as though all such  representations  and warranties had been made on
the Effective Date, except (i) for any such  representations and warranties made
as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct as of such date, (ii) as
expressly  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  or (iii) for  representations  and
warranties the inaccuracies of which relate to matters that,  individually or in
the aggregate, do not result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to BBI or
materially  adversely affect the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement  and FNB shall have received a  certificate  or  certificates
signed by the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer of BBI dated
the Effective Date, to such effect.

         (b)  Performance  of  Obligations.  BBI  shall  have  performed  in all
material  respects  all  obligations  required to be  performed by it under this
Agreement prior to the Effective Date, and FNB shall have received a certificate
signed by the Chief Executive Officer of BBI to that effect.

         (c) Affiliate Agreements. BBI shall use its best efforts to obtain from
each director and  shareholder of BBI who may be deemed by counsel for FNB to be
an "affiliate" of BBI within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
1933 an executed Affiliate Agreement described in Section 5.13 hereof.

Termination  Event),  8.1(c) (other than as a result of such Termination Event),
8.1(d) (other than as a result of such Termination Event), 8.1(e) (other than as
a result of such  Termination  Event)),  8.1(f)  (other than as a result of such
Termination  Event),  or  8.1(g)  (other  than as a result  of such  Termination
Event).  Upon payment of the  termination  fee and any other amounts that may be

         (c) If this  Agreement is terminated by FNB or BBI because of a willful

undertaking or restriction  set forth herein,  and provided that the terminating
party  shall  not  have  been  in  breach  (in  any  material  respect)  of  any
representation  and warranty,  covenant,  undertaking or  restriction  contained
herein,  then the  breaching  party shall bear and pay all such  reasonable  and
documented  costs and expenses of the other party actually  incurred,  including
fees and expenses of  consultants,  investment  bankers,  accountants,  counsel,
printers,  and  persons  involved  in  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement, including the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy

as required by Section 8.4(b),  final  settlement with respect to the payment of
other fees and
