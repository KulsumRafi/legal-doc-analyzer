3. INTEREST

         The outstanding principal balance of this Additional Standby Facility

imposition of the Default Rate (as hereinafter defined) or payment in full, at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate in effect on each Interest Adjustment
Date (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days

extent of any increase or decrease in the Prime Rate from the Prime Rate in
effect on the immediately preceding Interest Adjustment Date. After maturity, or

(6.0) percentage points in excess of the rate which would otherwise be in effect
hereunder.

<PAGE>

Note shall automatically be reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate for such period as
the Maximum Legal Rate is higher than the Contract Rate. If subsequently the
Contract Rate becomes less than the Maximum Legal Rate, then the interest rate
payable under this Additional Standby Facility Note shall automatically be
decreased to the Contract Rate. Any amounts paid in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate shall be considered to have been payments in reduction of principal, and
the outstanding principal balance shall be adjusted to reflect such prepayments
of principal.

4. PAYMENTS

         Accrued interest shall be due and payable monthly on the seventh day of
each month. Interest may, at the option of the holder hereof, be deducted from
the amount of the proceeds of any disbursements hereunder.

         Upon maturity, the outstanding principal balance of this Additional
Standby Facility Note, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon and any
other sums payable hereunder, shall be payable in full.

         All sums received hereunder shall be applied first to the payment of
late charges, costs and expenses payable to Lender hereunder, then to interest
(in the order in which earliest earned) and the balance to principal. Borrower
shall have the right to prepay this Additional Standby Facility Note in full or
in part at any time without penalty.

         All payments shall be made in accordance with the terms of the
Additional Standby Facility Loan Agreement and shall be delivered to Lender at
its address at Michael Jaharis, c/o Steven K. Aronoff, P.C., 475 Park Avenue
South, 23rd Floor, New York, New York 10016 or at such other address as shall be
designated by Lender in a written notice to the Borrower.

         This Additional Standby Facility Note may also be prepaid in part or in
full by the holder of this Additional Standby Facility Note exercising the
Warrant in accordance with the terms of the Warrant. No partial prepayment of
this Additional Standby Facility Note by exercise of the Warrant shall abate
Borrower's obligation to make monthly interest payments on the reduced principle
balance, nor shall any such partial prepayment extend the maturity date of this
Additional Standby Facility Note.

5. ADVANCES

         Advances shall be made hereunder from time to time in accordance with
the terms of the Additional Standby Facility Loan Agreement, reference to which
is hereby made for the provisions regarding advances. At no time shall the
aggregate of all advances outstanding from time to time exceed $30,000,000.00.

6. LATE CHARGE

         If any monthly payment of interest is not received by the Lender or any
holder hereof within 15 days after its due date, there shall be imposed on the
Borrower a late charge equal to five (5.0%) percent of such overdue payment.

7. ENFORCEMENT

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined),
the entire principal balance remaining unpaid plus accrued interest shall, at
the option of the holder hereof, become immediately due and payable, and the
Borrower shall have all of the rights and remedies provided in the Additional
Standby Facility Loan Agreement and shall be entitled to be reimbursed for its
costs and expenses as set forth therein.

         An Event of Default is defined as any one of the following: (i) default
in the payment of any principal, interest or other amounts within ten (10) days
after such payment is due hereunder; (ii) breach of any provisions of this
Additional Standby Facility Note; or (iii) the occurrence of any Event of
Default under the Additional Standby Facility Loan Agreement.

         No extension of time for payment, or delay in enforcement hereof, nor
any renewal of this Additional Standby Facility Note with or without notice,
shall release the obligation of the Borrower to the Lender or holder hereof or
shall operate as a waiver of any of its rights.

         Presentment, demand, protest and notice of dishonor are hereby waived
by the Borrower.

8. RIGHT OF SETOFF

         Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of
Default hereunder, the Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, without notice to the Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by
the Borrower) to set-off and apply any and all indebtedness at any time owing by
the Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Additional Standby Facility Note or the Additional Standby Facility Loan
Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the Lender shall have made any demand
under this Additional Standby Facility Note or the Additional Standby Facility
Loan Agreement. The Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such
setoff and application made by the Lender, provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The
rights of the Lender under this provision are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including, without limitation, any common law right of setoff) which
the Lender may have.
