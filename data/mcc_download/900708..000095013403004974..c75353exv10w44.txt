4.       INTERESTS IN OTHER BUSINESSES

(1) During the course of the Appointment the Executive shall not (unless the
Board shall in its absolute discretion so consent in writing) whether alone or
jointly with others and whether as principal, partner, manager, employee,
contractor, consultant, adviser, director, officer, shareholder, agent or
otherwise howsoever be engaged, concerned or interested in or assume
responsibilities or duties for, whether directly or indirectly, any business
whatsoever (other than any of the businesses of the Group) or any firm, company
(which is not a member of the Group), person, association, charity, trust or
society (whether incorporated or otherwise) save that notwithstanding the
foregoing:-

(a)      the Executive may be interested as a holder directly or through
         nominees for investment purposes only in any securities which are for
         the time being admitted to trading on a recognised stock exchange
         provided that none of the holdings of such securities in which the
         Executive shall be so interested shall at any time exceed five per cent
         in aggregate of the nominal value of the securities concerned for the
         time being in issue; and

(b)      the Executive (to the extent that and only for so long as the Board
         shall at its absolute discretion so consent in writing) may be
         concerned or take an interest in or assume responsibilities or duties
         to any firm, company, person, association, charity, trust or society
         (whether incorporated or otherwise) Provided always that (and without
         prejudicing the Board's absolute discretion):-



<PAGE>

                                      -7-



         (i)      the business or activity of such firm, company, person,
                  association, charity, trust or society is not in conflict and
                  does not compete and is not likely to conflict or compete with
                  any business of the Company or any Associated Company; and

         (ii)     the Executive's concern and interest in and responsibilities
                  and duties towards such firm, company, person, association,
                  charity, trust or society do not and are unlikely to interfere
                  with the proper performance of the Executive's duties under
                  this Agreement.

5.       HOURS OF WORK

The Executive will work the hours necessary or appropriate from time to time to
carry out his duties properly and effectively with no allowance or additional
payment for overtime. The parties believe that for the purposes of the Working
Time Regulations 1998 that the Executive is an autonomous worker (as defined by
Regulation 20), however and without prejudice to this belief the Executive
agrees whenever necessary to work longer than 48 hours per week on average.

6.       SALARY AND BONUS

(1) The Company shall pay the Executive during the continuance of his employment
a salary initially at the rate of Pound Sterling 130,000 per annum inclusive of
any Director's fees payable by the Company or any Associated Company which shall
accrue from day to day and shall be payable by twelve equal monthly instalments
in arrears, on or about the last working day of each calendar month by credit
transfer direct to the Executive's bank account.

(2) The Executive's salary shall be subject to a review (but not necessarily an
increase) which shall take place annually on or about the anniversary of the
date of commencement of the Executive's employment under this Agreement. The
Executive's salary may be increased with effect from any such review date at
the absolute discretion of the Board.

(3) The Executive agrees and hereby authorises the Company to deduct from any
wages (as defined in Part II of the Employment Rights Act 1996) due to the
Executive any sums due from the Executive to the Company or any Associated
Company.

(4) In addition to the salary referred to in sub-clause (1) and in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 2 attached hereto the Executive shall be paid
such bonuses,



<PAGE>
                                      -8-


additional remuneration and/or other benefits (if any) as the Board may from
time to time determine in its discretion but so that the Executive shall not be
entitled to any such bonus, additional remuneration and/or other benefits as of
right and so that the Company may at any time discontinue or vary the payment of
any such bonus, additional remuneration and/or other benefits it may in fact
make.

7.       EXPENSES

The Company shall during the continuance of the Executive's employment reimburse
the Executive all reasonable travelling, accommodation, entertainment and other
out-of-pocket expenses wholly and necessarily incurred by the Executive in the
proper performance of his duties under this Agreement upon production of
receipts or such appropriate evidence of payment.

8.       HOLIDAYS

(1) The Executive shall, in addition to public and bank holidays, (in accordance
with the proper performance of his duties under this Agreement) be entitled to
30 working days paid holiday in each calendar year or such proportion of days as
shall correspond to the actual period that the Executive may have worked for the
Company during the calendar year, to be taken at such times as shall have been
approved by the Board.

(2) The Executive shall be entitled to carry forward a maximum of 5 days accrued
but unused holiday entitlement from one calendar year to the next. Any accrued
but untaken holiday in excess of 5 days shall be forfeited by the Executive.

(3) Upon the termination of the Executive's employment (except in the case of
summary termination for cause when the Executive shall not be entitled to
receive any pay in lieu of accrued holiday) the Executive's entitlement to
accrued holiday pay shall be calculated on a pro rata basis in respect of each
completed month of service in the calendar year in which his employment
terminates so that if the Executive shall have taken more holiday than his
accrued entitlement the Company is hereby authorised (for the purposes of Part
II of the Employment Rights Act 1996) to make an appropriate deduction from the
Executive's final salary payment.

(4) The Company, at its discretion, may request the Executive to take any
outstanding holiday entitlement during any period of notice, and should the
Executive fail to do so, the Executive shall then lose any entitlement to
holiday pay in lieu.

(5) The Company shall be entitled to withhold any entitlement to holiday pay in
lieu if the Executive fails to give the Company proper notice of termination or
if the



<PAGE>
                                      -9-



Executive leaves before such notice has expired. In such a case the Executive's
holiday pay in lieu shall be reduced by the number of days notice not worked. In
any case where the Company agrees to waive the requirement for the Executive to
work out his notice, this sub-clause shall not apply.

9.       SICKNESS AND INJURY

(1) If at any time the Executive is absent from work due to sickness or injury
he shall promptly forward to the Company, if required, evidence of such sickness
or injury in a form satisfactory to the Board.

(2) The Company shall pay the Executive's salary under sub-clause 6(1) (less an
amount equal to his statutory sick pay) for the first 40 days in aggregate of
absence due to sickness or injury in any calendar year but shall not be required
to pay the Executive any salary and or other remuneration for any further
periods of such absence in any calendar year, although it may at its discretion
do so.

(3) If any incapacity is caused by any alleged action or wrong of a third party
and the Executive decides to claim damages in respect thereof, the Executive
shall use all reasonable endeavours to recover damages for loss of earnings over
the period for which salary has been paid or will be paid to the Executive by
the Company under this Clause 9 and will account to the Company for any such
damages recovered less any costs borne by the Executive in achieving such
recovery in an amount not exceeding the actual salary paid or payable by the
Company under this Clause 9 in respect of such period.

10.      CONFIDENTIALITY

(1) The Executive shall not (other than in the proper performance of his duties
or with the prior written consent of the Company or unless ordered by a court or
other authority of competent jurisdiction) at any time either during the
continuance of his employment or afterwards disclose to any person or use for
his own benefit or the benefit of any person other than the Company or any
Associated Company or through any failure to exercise all due care and diligence
cause, enable, authorise, assist or permit any unauthorised use or disclosure of
any information which he knows or ought reasonably to know concerns the business
of the Company or any Associated Company or any of its or their suppliers,
agents, distributors, customers or others which shall have been acquired
received or made by the Executive during the course of or in contemplation of
his employment (whether or not expressly designated "confidential" and whether

Company or any Associated Company and the Executive shall not during the
continuance of his employment or afterwards use cause, enable, authorise, assist

of the Company or any Associated Company. The Executive shall hand over to the
Company any such Records on the termination of his employment or at the request
of the Company or any Associated Company at any time during the course of his
employment.

(3) For the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the generality of this
Clause 10 the following is a non-exhaustive list of matters which in relation to
the Company or any Associated Company are considered to be confidential and must
be treated as such by the Executive:-

         future business strategy, tenders and any price-sensitive information

    property of the Company or any Associated Company; or

12.      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

to the extent provided in Section 40 Patents Act 1977 or any similar provisions

any other persons in applying for letters patent or other equivalent protection
