Any voluntary prepayment of a Swingline Loan must be in integral multiples of $100,000 or the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans (or such other minimum amounts upon which the Swingline Lender and the Borrowers may agree) and in connection with any such prepayment, the Borrowers must give the Swingline Lender prior written notice thereof no later than 10:00 a.m. on the date of such prepayment.  The Swingline Loans shall, in addition to this Agreement, be evidenced by the Swingline Note.<br>
<br>
(e) Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans.  The Borrowers agree to repay each Swingline Loan within five (5) Business Days after the date such Swingline Loan was made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Swingline Loans on the Termination Date (or such earlier date as the Swingline Lender and the Borrowers may agree in writing).  In the event that the Agent has not either (x) received a Notice of Borrowing or a Competitive Bid Request indicating that such Swingline Loan is to be repaid with the proceeds thereof within five (5) Business Days of the date such Swingline Loan was made or (y) received notice from the Borrowers that they intend to repay such Swingline Loan within five (5) Business Days of the date such Swingline Loan was made and, in the case of this clause (y) only, such Swingline Loan is not repaid by 11:30 a.m. on such date, the Swingline Lender may, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably direct the Swingline Lender to act on their behalf), request a borrowing of Revolving Loans (which shall be Base Rate Loans) from the Lenders in an amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline Loan.  The limitations of Section 3.5(a) shall not apply to any borrowing of Base Rate Loans made pursuant to this subsection.  The Swingline Lender shall give notice to the Agent of any such borrowing of Base Rate Loans not later than 12:00 noon on the proposed date of such borrowing, and the Agent shall promptly give notice to the Lenders of any such borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  No later than 2:00 p.m. on such date, each Lender will make available to the Agent at the Principal Office for the account of Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the proceeds of the Base Rate Loan to be made by such Lender.  The Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Base Rate Loans to the Swingline Lender, which shall apply such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan.  If the Lenders are prohibited from making Loans required to be made under this subsection for any reason, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Events of Default described in Sections 10.1(f) or 10.1(g), each Lender shall purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan in such amount (regardless of whether the conditions precedent thereto set forth in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, whether or not the Borrowers have submitted a Notice of Borrowing and whether or not the Commitments are then in effect, any Event of Default exists or all the Loans have been accelerated) and paying the proceeds thereof to the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lender's demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders to purchase a participation therein).  Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).  A Lender's obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline Loan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have or claim against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default (including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of Default described in Sections 10.1(f) or 10.1(g)) or the termination of any Lender's Commitment, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event or condition which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of any Loan Document by the Agent, any Lender or the Borrowers or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  Upon the receipt by Swingline Lender of any payment in respect of any Swingline Loan, Swingline Lender shall promptly pay to each Lender that has acquired and funded a participation therein under this Section 2.2(e) such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such payment; provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the Swingline Lender to it.<br>

(a) For so long as the Parent maintains a Credit Rating of BBB- or better from S&amp;P or Baa3 or better from Moody's, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time and from time to time from the Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date, and provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrowers may request and each Lender may in its sole and absolute discretion make Competitive Advances to Borrowers in such principal amounts as Borrowers may request pursuant to a Competitive Bid Request that do not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Competitive Advance Notes (after giving effect to all amounts requested thereunder) being in excess of an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes (after giving effect to all amounts requested thereunder) plus the Letter of Credit Liabilities being in excess of the aggregate amount of the Commitments.<br>
<br>
(b) Borrowers shall request Competitive Advances by submitting a duly completed Competitive Bid Request to the Agent, which Competitive Bid Request shall specify the relevant date, amount and maturity for the proposed Competitive Advance.  Each request shall be for an advance on the basis of a margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate and shall have a maturity date equal to one of the Interest Periods (subject to the limitations therein.)  In the event that the Borrowers shall have submitted two (2) Competitive Bid Requests in any calendar month, any additional Competitive Bid Requests during such month shall be accompanied by payment of a nonrefundable $2500 competitive bid request fee for the account of the Agent.  Any Competitive Advance shall be a LIBOR Loan.  The proposed funding date shall be a Business Day.  The Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting upon any Competitive Bid Request purportedly made by a Responsible Officer of Borrowers, which hereby agree to indemnify the Agent from any loss, cost, expense or liability as a result of so acting.  The Competitive Bid Request must be received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on a Business Day that is at least four (4) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Competitive Advance.<br>

The Borrowers may request offers to make Competitive Advances for up to six (6) Interest Periods in a single Competitive Bid Request.<br>
<br>
(e) The Agent shall, promptly after receipt of a Competitive Bid Request, provide the Lenders a copy thereof by telecopier.  Any Lender may, by written notice to the Agent, advise the Agent that it elects not to be so notified of Competitive Bid Requests, in which case the Agent shall not notify such Lender of the Competitive Bid Request.<br>
<br>
(f) Each Lender receiving a Competitive Bid Request may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make or not make a Competitive Bid responsive to the Competitive Bid Request.  A Lender shall have no obligation to make a Competitive Bid.  Each Competitive Bid shall be submitted so as to be received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (or, in the case of the Lender acting as Agent, not later than 9:00 a.m.) on the date which is three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Competitive Advance.  Any Competitive Bid received by the Agent after 10:00 a.m. (or 9:00 a.m. in the case of the Lender acting as Agent) on such date shall be disregarded for purposes of this Agreement.  The Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting upon any Competitive Bid purportedly made by a Responsible Officer of a Lender, each of which hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent from any loss, cost, expense or liability as a result of so acting with respect to that Lender.<br>
<br>
(g) Each Competitive Bid shall specify the margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for the offered Maximum Competitive Advance set forth in the Competitive Bid.  The Maximum Competitive Advance offered by a Lender in a Competitive Bid shall not exceed the Competitive Advance requested and may be less than the Competitive Advance requested by Borrowers in the Competitive Bid Request, but shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000.  Any Competitive Bid which offers an interest rate other than a margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, is in a form other than as set forth in Exhibit C or which otherwise contains any term, condition, qualification or provision not contained in the Competitive Bid Request (including without limitation a requirement of a minimum advance) or is received after the time set forth in this Section 2.3(g) shall be disregarded for purposes of this Agreement.  A Competitive Bid once submitted to the Agent shall, subject to the terms of Section 4.3 and Article V, be irrevocable until 12:00 noon on the date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the requested Competitive Advance set forth in the related Competitive Bid Request, and shall expire by its terms at such time unless accepted by Borrowers on or prior thereto.<br>
<br>
(h) Promptly after 10:00 a.m. on the date which is three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Competitive Advance, the Agent shall notify Borrowers of the names of the Lenders providing Competitive Bids to the Agent at or before 10:00 a.m. on that date (or 9:00 a.m. in the case of the Lender acting as Agent) and satisfying the conditions of this Section 2.3 and the Maximum Competitive Advance and margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate set forth by each such Lender in its Competitive Bid.<br>
<br>
(i) Borrowers may, in their sole and absolute discretion, reject any or all of the Competitive Bids.  If Borrowers accept any Competitive Bid, by telephone or in writing (provided that any acceptance by telephone shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy of such acceptance signed by Borrowers), the following shall apply:  (i)  Borrowers must accept all Competitive Bids at all lower margins over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate before accepting any portion of a Competitive Bid at a higher margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, (ii) if two or more Lenders have submitted a Competitive Bid at the same margin, then Borrowers must accept either all of such Competitive Bids or accept such Competitive Bids in the same proportion as the Maximum Competitive Advance of each Lender bears to the aggregate Maximum Competitive Advances of all such Lenders, (iii) Borrowers may not accept Competitive Bids for an aggregate amount in excess of the requested Competitive Advance set forth in the Competitive Bid Request, and (iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bids accepted must be at least $3,000,000 and shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000.  Acceptance by Borrowers of a Competitive Bid must be made prior to 12:00 noon on the date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the requested Competitive Advance.  Acceptance of a Competitive Bid by Borrowers shall be accomplished by telephonic or written notification thereof to the Agent (provided that any acceptance by telephone shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy of such acceptance signed by Borrowers) and shall be irrevocable upon such notification.  The Agent shall promptly notify each of the Lenders whose Competitive Bid has been accepted by Borrowers by telephone, which notification shall promptly be confirmed in writing delivered in person or by telecopier to such Lenders.  Any Competitive Bid not accepted or rejected by Borrowers by 12:00 noon, on the date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed Competitive Advance, shall be deemed rejected.<br>
<br>
(j) In the case of a Competitive Bid, the Agent shall determine the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate on the date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Competitive Advance, and shall promptly thereafter notify Borrowers and the Lenders whose Competitive Bids were accepted by Borrowers of such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.<br>
<br>
(k) A Lender whose Competitive Bid has been accepted by Borrowers shall make the Competitive Advance in accordance with the Competitive Bid Request and with its Competitive Bid, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in this Agreement, by making funds immediately available to the Agent at the Principal Office in the amount of such Competitive Advance not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date set forth in the Competitive Bid Request.  The Agent shall then promptly make available to the Borrowers the aggregate amount of the Competitive Advances made available to the Agent by crediting such amount in immediately available funds to the account of the Borrowers on the books of such office of Agent.<br>
<br>
(l) The Agent shall notify Borrowers and the Lenders promptly after any Competitive Advance is made of the amounts and maturity of such Competitive Advances, the identity of the Lenders making such Competitive Advances, and the margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Competitive Advances.<br>
<br>
(m) The Competitive Advances made by a Lender shall be evidenced by that Lender's Competitive Advance Note.<br>
<br>
(n) Each Competitive Advance shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement generally, provided, however, that a Competitive Advance shall not reduce a Lender's Commitment or a Lender's obligation to fund its Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Loan or to participate in Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit.  If the Borrowers prepay any Competitive Advance prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period, the Borrowers shall pay all amounts due under&nbsp;<br>
 Section 4.4.<br>
<br>
(o) The principal amount of any "Money Market Loans" (as defined in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement) outstanding as of the date hereof shall continue as Competitive Advances under this Agreement for the balance of the term and at such rate as exists under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.<br>

Section 2.4 Letters of Credit.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(a) Letters of Credit.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Issuing Lender, on behalf of the Lenders, agrees to issue for the account of the Borrowers during the period from and including the Effective Date to, but excluding, the date 30 days prior to the Termination Date one or more Standby Letters of Credit up to a maximum aggregate Stated Amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the L/C Commitment Amount with respect thereto.  Issuing Lender has issued the Gables Bond Enhancement Letters of Credit described on Schedule 1.1(a) hereto.  Such Gables Bond Enhancement Letters of Credit shall remain in place as of the date of this Agreement and be deemed to be a Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit under this Agreement for all purposes.  Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue any additional Gables Bond Enhancement Letters of Credit (provided the foregoing shall not prohibit any extension or modification of any of the existing Gables Bond Enhancement Letters of Credit).  In the event that any of the Gables Bond Enhancement Letters of Credit shall not be outstanding, the Borrowers may use such unutilized portion of the Commitment for Loans or Standby Letters of Credit subject to the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(b) Terms of Letters of Credit.  At the time of issuance, the amount, form, terms and conditions of each Letter of Credit, and of any drafts or acceptances thereunder, shall be subject to approval by the Issuing Lender and the Borrowers.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the expiration date (i) of any Standby Letter of Credit extend beyond the earlier of (A) the date that is one (1) year from its date of issuance or (B) the date that is five (5) days prior to the Termination Date, or (ii) of any Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit extend beyond five (5) days prior to the Termination Date.<br>
<br>
(c) Requests for Issuance of Standby Letters of Credit.  The Borrowers shall give the Issuing Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance of a Standby Letter of Credit, such notice to describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Standby Letter of Credit and the nature of the transactions or obligations proposed to be supported by such Standby Letter of Credit, and in any event shall set forth with respect to such Standby Letter of Credit (i) the proposed initial Stated Amount, (ii) the beneficiary or beneficiaries, and (iii) the proposed expiration date.  The Borrowers shall also execute and deliver such customary letter of credit application forms as requested from time to time by the Issuing Lender.  Provided the Borrowers have given the notice prescribed by the first sentence of this subsection and subject to Section 2.14 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article V, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Standby Letter of Credit on the requested date of issuance for the benefit of the stipulated beneficiary and will notify each Lender of the issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit within a reasonable time after the issuance thereof.  The Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers a copy of each issued Standby Letter of Credit within a reasonable time after the date of issuance thereof.  To the extent any term of a Letter of Credit Document is inconsistent with a term of any Loan Document, the term of such Loan Document shall control.<br>
<br>
(d) Reimbursement Obligations.  Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender from the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of any demand for payment under such Letter of Credit (but subject to the terms of Section 2.4(l)), the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agent of the amount to be paid by the Issuing Lender as a result of such demand and the date on which payment is to be made by the Issuing Lender to such beneficiary in respect of such demand; provided, however, the Issuing Lender's failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice shall not discharge the Borrowers in any respect from the applicable Reimbursement Obligation.  The Borrowers hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to pay and reimburse the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender for the amount of each demand for payment under such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by the Issuing Lender to the beneficiary thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind.  Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender of any payment in respect of any Reimbursement Obligation, the Issuing Lender shall promptly pay to each Lender that has acquired and funded a participation therein under the second sentence of Section 2.4(i) such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such payment; provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Issuing Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Issuing Lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.<br>
<br>
(e) Manner of Reimbursement.  Upon its receipt of a notice referred to in Section 2.4(d), the Borrowers shall advise the Agent and the Issuing Lender whether or not the Borrowers intend to borrow hereunder to finance its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of the related demand for payment.  If the Borrowers fail to so advise the Agent and the Issuing Lender, or if the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender for a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit by the date of such payment, then (i) if the applicable conditions contained in Article V would permit the making of Revolving Loans, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a borrowing of Revolving Loans (which shall be Base Rate Loans) in an amount equal to the unpaid Reimbursement Obligation and the Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice (which shall be no later than 12:00 p.m.) of the amount of the Revolving Loan to be made available to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. and (ii) if such conditions would not permit the making of Revolving Loans, the provisions of Section 2.4(j) shall apply.  The limitations of Section 3.5(a) shall not apply to any borrowing of Base Rate Loans under this subsection.  This subsection shall be subject to the terms of Section 2.4(l) with respect to the reimbursement of an advance pursuant to a Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit.<br>
<br>
(f) Effect of Letters of Credit on Commitments.  Upon the issuance by the Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Commitment of each Lender shall be deemed to be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Lender's Commitment Percentage and (ii) the sum of (A) the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit plus (B) any related Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding.<br>
<br>
(g) Issuing Lender's Duties Regarding Letters of Credit; Unconditional Nature of Reimbursement Obligation.  In examining documents presented in connection with drawings under Letters of Credit and making payments under such Letters of Credit against such documents, the Issuing Lender shall only be required to use the same standard of care as it uses in connection with examining documents presented in connection with drawings under letters of credit in which it has not sold participations and making payments under such letters of credit.  The Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, neither the Agent, the Issuing Lender nor any of the Lenders shall be responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of or any drawing honored under any Letter of Credit even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit, or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telex, telecopy or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or the proceeds of any drawing under any Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Lenders.  None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the Agent's, the Issuing Lender's or any Lender's rights or powers hereunder.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create against the Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender any liability to the Borrowers or any Lender.  In this connection, the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any drawing made under any Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation, the following circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit Document or any term or provisions therein; (B) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the Letter of Credit Documents; (C) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrowers may have at any time against the Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary or transferee of a Letter of Credit or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in the Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (D) any breach of contract or dispute between the Borrowers, any beneficiary or transferee of a Letter of Credit, the Agent, the Issuing Lender, any Lender or any other Person; (E) any draft, certificate, demand, statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein or made in connection therewith being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (F) any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary or transferee of a Letter of Credit or any other Person of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; (G) payment by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft, certificate, demand, statement or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (H) any improper use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or any improper acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit in connection therewith; (I) any irregularity in the transaction with respect to which any Letter of Credit is issued, including any fraud by the beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit; (J) the legality, validity, form, regularity or enforceability of the Letter of Credit; (K) the failure of any payment by Issuing Lender to conform to the terms of a Letter of Credit (if, in Issuing Lender's good faith judgment, such payment is determined to be appropriate); (L) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (M) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; and (N) any other act, omission to act, delay or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of the Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section or Section 12.9, but not in limitation of the Borrowers' unconditional obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any drawing made under a Letter of Credit as provided in this Section, (i) the Issuing Lender shall be and remain liable for matters arising solely from its gross negligence and willful misconduct as actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) the Borrowers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender in respect of any liability incurred by the Issuing Lender arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit as actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Section shall affect any rights the Borrowers may have with respect to the Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to any Letter of Credit.<br>
<br>
(h) Amendments, Etc.  The issuance by the Issuing Lender of any extension, amendment, supplement or other modification to any Letter of Credit shall be subject to the same conditions applicable under this Agreement to the issuance of new Letters of Credit (including, without limitation, that the request therefor be made through the Issuing Lender), and no such extension, amendment, supplement or other modification shall be issued unless either (i) the respective Letter of Credit affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally been issued hereunder in such extended, amended, supplemented or modified form or (ii) the Requisite Lenders shall have consented thereto.  In connection with any such extension, amendment, supplement or other modification, the Borrowers shall pay the Fees, if any, payable under Section 3.6(b).<br>
<br>
(i) Lenders' Participation in Letters of Credit.  Immediately upon the issuance by the Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the liability of the Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit and each Lender thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be unconditionally obligated to the Issuing Lender to pay and discharge when due, such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Issuing Lender's liability under such Letter of Credit.  In addition, upon the making of each payment by a Lender to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in respect of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.4(j), such Lender shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of the Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation owing to the Issuing Lender by the Borrowers in respect of such Letter of Credit and (ii) a participation in a percentage equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage in any interest or other amounts payable by the Borrowers in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation (other than the Fees payable to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.6(b)).<br>
<br>
(j) Payment Obligation of Lenders.  Each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender on demand in immediately available funds in Dollars the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of each drawing paid by the Issuing Lender under each Letter of Credit to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.4(d) or Section 2.4(l).  Each such Lender's obligation to make such payments to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender under this subsection, and the Issuing Lender's right to receive the same, shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be affected in any way by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) the failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this subsection, (ii) the financial condition of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, (iii) the existence of any Default or Event of Default, including any Event of Default described in Section 10.1(f) or 10.1(g), or (iv) the termination of the Commitments.  Each such payment to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or deduction whatsoever.<br>
<br>
(k) Information to Lenders.  Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, the Issuing Lender shall deliver to such Lender information reasonably requested by such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding.  Other than as set forth in this subsection and in Section 2.4(c), the Issuing Lender shall have no duty to notify the Lenders regarding the issuance or other matters regarding Letters of Credit issued hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Issuing Lender shall be reimbursed by the Borrowers in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation for any Regular Drawing on or prior to the date on which such payment is to be made by the Issuing Lender under the applicable Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit (which reimbursement shall be made without any borrowing under this Agreement).  If the Issuing Lender is not so reimbursed in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation for any Regular Drawing on or prior to the date on which such payment is to be made by the Issuing Lender, then, without notice to or consent of the Borrowers, (i) the Issuing Lender may notify the applicable Trustee within the period provided in the applicable Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit or the applicable Bond Documents that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to such Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit or that an Event of Default has occurred and that such amount shall not be reinstated, and (ii) the Issuing Lender shall be reimbursed for such amount as provided in Section 2.4(e) or Section 2.4(j), as applicable.  The Issuing Lender may also notify the applicable Trustee in the event that an Event of Default occurs.  With respect to any Remarketing Drawing only, such amount will be reinstated only upon receipt by the applicable Trustee of notice from the Issuing Lender that the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to such Remarketing Drawing has been repaid other than as a result of a borrowing under this Agreement.  Drawings on a Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit other than a Regular Drawing or a Remarketing Drawing may be reimbursed through the obtaining of a Loan as provided in this Section 2.4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time) plus the Applicable Margin (utilizing the applicable "Base Rate Margin" as identified in the definition of Applicable Margin, it being acknowledged that the Applicable Margin is a negative number, the addition of which will result in an interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans which is lower than the corresponding Base Rate);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) during such periods as such Loan (other than a Competitive Advance) is a LIBOR Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor plus the Applicable Margin (utilizing the applicable "LIBOR Margin" as identified in the definition of Applicable Margin); and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) with respect to each Competitive Advance, at the margin over the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate determined pursuant to Section 2.3.<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding principal amount of any Loan made by such Lender, on all Reimbursement Obligations and on any other amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lender to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation, accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law).<br>
<br>
(b) Payment of Interest.  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable (i) in the case of a Base Rate Loan on the first day of each calendar month, (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period therefor (provided, however, if any Interest Period for a LIBOR Loan exceeds ninety (90) days, interest shall also be payable with respect to such Loans on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, as applicable), and (iii) in the case of any Loan, upon the payment, prepayment or Continuation thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan of another Type (but only on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Continued or Converted).  Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.  Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders to which such interest is payable and to the Borrowers.  All determinations by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the Borrowers for all purposes, absent manifest error.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.6 Number of Interest Periods.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
There may be no more than six (6) different Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans (excluding Competitive Advances) outstanding at the same time.<br>

<br>
(a) Optional.  Subject to Section 3.5 and Section 4.4, the Borrowers may prepay any Loan and terminate any Gables Bond Enhancement Letter of Credit at any time without premium or penalty.  The Borrowers shall give the Agent at least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice of the prepayment of any Revolving Loan.<br>
<br>
(b) Mandatory.  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities and the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans and Competitive Advances, exceeds the amount of the Total Commitment in effect at such time, the Borrowers shall immediately pay to the Agent for the accounts of the Lenders the amount of such excess.  Such payment shall be applied by the Agent to pay all amounts of principal outstanding on the Revolving Loans and any Reimbursement Obligations pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2 and if any Letters of Credit are outstanding at such time the remainder, if any, shall be deposited by the Agent into the Collateral Account for application to any Reimbursement Obligations.  If the Borrowers are required to pay any outstanding LIBOR Loans by reason of this Section prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period therefor, the Borrowers shall pay all amounts due under Section 4.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers shall have the right, and may designate, which Loans are to be repaid or prepaid and in what order (e.g., Base Rate Loans first, then LIBOR Loans, then Competitive Advances).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.9 Continuation.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrowers may on any Business Day, with respect to any Revolving Loan that is a LIBOR Loan, elect to maintain such LIBOR Loan or any portion thereof as a LIBOR Loan by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan.  Each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest Period shall be made by the Borrowers' giving to the Agent a Notice of Continuation not later than 11:00 a.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the date of any such Continuation.  Such notice by the Borrowers of a Continuation shall be by telephone or telecopy, confirmed immediately in writing if by telephone, in the form of a Notice of Continuation, specifying (a) the proposed date of such Continuation, (b) the LIBOR Loans and portions thereof subject to such Continuation and (c) the duration of the selected Interest Period, all of which shall be specified in such manner as is necessary to comply with all limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder.  Each Notice of Continuation shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrowers once given.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Agent shall notify each Lender by telecopy, or other similar form of transmission, of the proposed Continuation.  If the Borrowers shall fail to select in a timely manner a new Interest Period for any such LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Section, or shall fail to give a timely Notice of Conversion with respect to a Base Rate Loan, or if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, Convert into (or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan, continue as) a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 2.10 or the Borrowers' failure to comply with any of the terms of such Section.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.10 Conversion.&nbsp;<br>

So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrowers may on any Business Day, upon the Borrowers' giving of a Notice of Conversion to the Agent, Convert all or a portion of a Revolving Loan of one Type into a Revolving Loan of another Type.  Any Conversion of a Revolving Loan that is a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan and, upon Conversion of a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, the Borrowers shall pay accrued interest to the date of Conversion on the principal amount so Converted.  Each such Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into Base Rate Loans and on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into LIBOR Loans.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Agent shall notify each Lender by telecopy, or other similar form of transmission, of the proposed Conversion.  Subject to the restrictions specified above, each Notice of Conversion shall be by telephone (confirmed immediately in writing) or telecopy in the form of a Notice of Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of Revolving Loan to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Revolving Loan to be Converted, (d) the Type of Revolving Loan such Revolving Loan is to be Converted into and (e) if such Conversion is into a LIBOR Loan, the requested duration of the Interest Period of such Loan.  Each Notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrowers once given.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.11 Notes.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(a) Revolving Note.  The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall, in addition to this Agreement, also be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrowers substantially in the form of Exhibit M (each a "Revolving Note"), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as originally in effect and otherwise duly completed.  By delivery of the Revolving Notes, there shall not be deemed to have occurred, and there has not otherwise occurred, any payment, satisfaction or novation of the Indebtedness evidenced by the "Syndicated Loan Notes" described in the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, which Indebtedness is instead allocated among the Lenders as of the date hereof and evidenced by the Revolving Notes and their respective Commitment Percentages, and the Lenders shall as of the date hereof make such adjustments to the outstanding Loans of such Lenders so that such outstanding Revolving Loans are consistent with their respective Commitment Percentages.<br>
<br>
(b) Records.  The date, amount, interest rate, Type and duration of Interest Periods (if applicable) of each Loan made by each Lender to the Borrowers, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books and such entries shall be binding on the Borrowers absent manifest error.<br>
<br>
(c) Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Notes.  Upon receipt by the Borrowers of (i) written notice from a Lender that a Note of such Lender has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, and (ii) (A) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, an unsecured agreement of indemnity from such Lender in form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers, or (B) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Borrowers shall at their own expense execute and deliver to such Lender a new Note dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.12 Voluntary Reductions of the Commitment.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
The Borrowers shall have the right to terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitments (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities and the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans and Competitive Advances) at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium upon not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice to the Agent of each such termination or reduction, which notice shall specify the effective date thereof and the amount of any such reduction and shall be irrevocable once given and effective only upon receipt by the Agent.  The Agent will promptly transmit such notice to each Lender.  The Commitments may not be reduced below $100,000,000 in the aggregate unless the Borrowers terminate the Commitments in their entirety, and, once terminated or reduced, the Commitments may not be increased or reinstated.  Any reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall result in a proportionate reduction (rounded to the next lowest integral multiple of multiple of $100,000) in the maximum amount of Competitive Advances.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.13 Expiration or Maturity Date of Letters of Credit Past Termination Date.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If on the date (the "Facility Termination Date") the Commitments are terminated (whether voluntarily, by reason of acceleration following the occurrence of an Event of Default or otherwise), there are any Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder, the Borrowers shall, on the Facility Termination Date, pay to the Agent an amount of money equal to the Stated Amount of such Letter(s) of Credit for deposit into the Collateral Account.  If a drawing pursuant to any such Letter of Credit occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Borrowers authorize the Issuing Lender to notify the Agent, and authorize the Agent to pay to the Issuing Lender monies deposited in the Collateral Account for Issuing Lender to make payment to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the payee with respect to such presentment.  If no drawing occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Agent shall withdraw the monies deposited in the Collateral Account with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit on or before the date fifteen (15) Business Days after the expiration date of such Letter of Credit and apply such funds to the Obligations, if any, then due and payable in the order prescribed by Section 10.3.  No amount drawn under a Letter of Credit after the Facility Termination Date shall be subject to reinstatement.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.14 Amount Limitations.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, at no time may the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans and Competitive Advances  and the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.15 Increase of Commitments.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
Subject to the approval of the Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Borrowers shall have the right to request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments (provided that there shall be no more than two such increases in the Commitments and the aggregate amount of such increases in the Commitments pursuant to this Section shall not exceed $48,000,000) by providing written notice to the Agent, which notice shall be irrevocable once given.  Each such increase in the Commitments must be an aggregate minimum amount of $20,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request.  Each existing Lender shall have the right to increase its Commitment by an amount so that such Lender's Commitment Percentage shall not be decreased as a result of such requested increase in the Commitments.  All other allocations of such requested increase shall be subject to the approval of the Agent.  Each Lender shall notify the Agent within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Agent's notice whether such Lender wishes to increase the amount of its Commitment.  If a Lender fails to deliver any such notice to the Agent within such time period, then such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.  No Lender shall be required to increase its Commitment and any new Lender(s) becoming a party to this Agreement in connection with any such requested increase must be an Eligible Assignee.  In the event a new Lender or Lenders become a party to this Agreement, or if any existing Lender agrees to increase its Commitment, such Lender shall on the date it becomes a Lender hereunder (or increases its Commitment, in the case of an existing Lender) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Lenders its Commitment Percentage (as determined after giving effect to the increase of Commitments) of any outstanding Revolving Loans, by making available to the Agent for the account of such other Lenders at the Principal Office, in same day funds, an amount equal to the sum of (a) the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans to be purchased by such Lender plus (b) the aggregate amount of payments previously made by the other Lenders under Sections 2.2(e) or 2.4(j) which have not been repaid, and the Borrowers shall pay to such other Lenders interest accrued and unpaid to and as of such date on such portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans.  The Borrowers shall also pay to the Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Lenders under Section 4.4 as a result of the prepayment of any such Revolving Loans.  No increase of the Commitments may be effected under this Section if either (x) a Default or Event of Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase or (y) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party in any Loan Document to which any such Loan Party is a party is not (or would not be) true or correct in all material respects on the effective date of such increase (except for representations or warranties which expressly relate solely to an earlier date and except for changes in factual circumstances or transactions, in either event not prohibited hereunder).  In connection with any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this subsection, (A) any Lender becoming a party hereto shall execute such documents and agreements as the Agent may reasonably request and (B) the Borrowers shall make appropriate arrangements so that each new Lender, and any existing Lender increasing its Commitment, receives a new or replacement Note, as appropriate, in the amount of such Lender's Commitment and a Competitive Advance Note within two (2) Business Days of the effectiveness of the applicable increase in the aggregate amount of Commitments.  The Borrowers shall also execute and deliver to the other Lenders replacement Competitive Advance Notes increasing the principal face amount thereof to 50% of the new Total Commitment.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 2.16 Advances by Agent.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
Unless the Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the specified date of borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Agent the Loan to be made by such Lender on such date, the Agent may assume that such Lender will make the proceeds of such Loan available to the Agent on the date of the requested borrowing and the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers the amount of such Loan to be provided by such Lender and such Lender shall be liable to Agent for the amount of such advance.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount upon the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall promptly pay such corresponding amount to the Agent.  The Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrowers, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Agent to the Borrowers to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrowers at the applicable rate for such Loan or (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

<b>
Section 3.3 Sharing of Payments, Etc.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Loan made by it to the Borrowers under this Agreement, or shall obtain payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrowers or a Loan Party through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or other payments made by the Borrowers to a Lender not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2 or Section 10.3, as applicable, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans made by the other Lenders or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses which may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2 or Section 10.3.  To such end, all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.  The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation.

(a) Generally.  If for any reason any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") shall fail or refuse to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party within the time period specified for performance of such obligation or, if no time period is specified, if such failure or refusal continues for a period of two (2) Business Days after notice from the Agent, then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to the Agent or the Borrowers under this Agreement or Applicable Law, such Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the administration of the Loans, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including without limitation, any right to vote in respect of, to consent to or to direct any action or inaction of the Agent or to be taken into account in the calculation of all of the Lenders or the Requisite Lenders, shall be suspended during the pendency of such failure or refusal.  If a Lender is a Defaulting Lender because it has failed to make timely payment to the Agent of any amount required to be paid to the Agent hereunder (without giving effect to any notice or cure periods), in addition to other rights and remedies which the Agent or the Borrowers may have under the immediately preceding provisions or otherwise, the Agent shall be entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender on such delinquent payment for the period from the date on which the payment was due until the date on which the payment is made at the Federal Funds Rate, (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in satisfaction of the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and (iii) to bring an action or suit against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any related interest.  Any amounts received by the Agent in respect of a Defaulting Lender's Loans shall not be paid to such Defaulting Lender and shall be held uninvested by the Agent and either applied against the purchase price of such Loans under Section 3.11(b) or paid to such Defaulting Lender upon the Defaulting Lender's curing of its default.<br>
<br>
(b) Purchase or Cancellation of Defaulting Lender's Commitment.  Any Lender who is not a Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to acquire all of a Defaulting Lender's Commitment.  Any Lender desiring to exercise such right shall give written notice thereof to the Agent and the Borrowers no sooner than two (2) Business Days and not later than five (5) Business Days after such Defaulting Lender became a Defaulting Lender.  If more than one Lender exercises such right, each such Lender shall have the right to acquire an amount of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment in proportion to the Commitments of the other Lenders exercising such right.  If after such fifth (5th) Business Day, the Lenders have not elected to purchase all of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrowers may, by giving written notice thereof to the Agent, such Defaulting Lender and the other Lenders, either (i) demand that such Defaulting Lender assign its Commitment to an Eligible Assignee approved by Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5(d) for the purchase price provided for below or (ii) terminate the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, whereupon such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents (except as expressly provided in this Section 3.11(b)).  No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  Upon any such purchase or assignment, the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Loans and its rights hereunder (but not its liability in respect thereof or under the Loan Documents or this Agreement to the extent the same relate to the period prior to the effective date of the purchase) shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest to the purchaser or assignee thereof, including an appropriate Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and, notwithstanding Section 12.5(d), shall pay to the Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $3,500.  The purchase price for the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender shall be equal to the amount of the principal balance of the Loans outstanding and owed by the Borrowers to the Defaulting Lender.  Prior to payment of such purchase price to a Defaulting Lender, the Agent shall apply against such purchase price any amounts retained by the Agent pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.11(a).  The Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive amounts owed to it by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents which accrued prior to the date of the default by the Defaulting Lender, to the extent the same are received by the Agent from or on behalf of the Borrowers.  There shall be no recourse against any Lender or the Agent for the payment of such sums except to the extent of the receipt of payments from any other party or in respect of the Loans.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 3.12 Taxes.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(a) Taxes Generally.  All payments by the Borrowers of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and all other Obligations shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future excise, stamp or other taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions, withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding (i) franchise taxes, and (ii) any taxes imposed on or measured by any Lender's assets, net income, receipts or branch profits (such non-excluded items being collectively called "Taxes").  If any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrowers hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any Applicable Law, then the Borrowers will:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) pay to the Agent for its account or the account of the applicable Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the Agent or such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.<br>
<br>
(b) Tax Indemnification.  If the Borrowers fail to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fail to remit to the Agent, for its account or the account of the respective Lender, as the case may be, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrowers shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.  For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrowers.<br>
<br>
(c) Tax Forms.  Prior to the date that any Lender or participant organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America becomes a party hereto, such Person shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent (but only so long as such Lender or participant is or remains lawfully able to do so) such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender or participant indicating whether payments to it hereunder and under the Notes are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax or (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Internal Revenue Code because such payment is either effectively connected with the conduct by such Lender or participant of a trade or business in the United States or totally exempt from United States Federal withholding tax by reason of the application of the provisions of a treaty to which the United States is a party or such Lender is otherwise wholly exempt; provided that nothing herein (including, without limitation, the failure or inability to provide any of such certificates, documents or other evidence) shall relieve the Borrowers of their obligations under this Section 3.12.  In addition, any such Lender or participant shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent (but only so long as such Lender or participant is or remains lawfully able to do so) further copies of any such certificate, document or other evidence on or before the date that any such certificate, document or other evidence expires or becomes obsolete.

Section 4.1 Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
(a) Additional Costs.  The Borrowers shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make any LIBOR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its Loans or its Commitment (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change that:  (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or its Commitment (other than taxes which are excluded from the definition of Taxes pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.12(a)); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (other than Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other reserve requirement to the extent utilized in the determination of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender, or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender hereunder); or (iii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy).<br>
<br>
(b) Lender's Suspension of LIBOR Loans.  Without limiting the effect of the provisions of Section 4.1(a), if, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert any other Type of Loans into, LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 4.6 shall apply).<br>
<br>
(c) Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit.  Without limiting the obligations of the Borrowers under the preceding subsections of this Section (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued by any Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Issuing Lender of issuing (or any Lender of purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit or reduce any amount receivable by the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by the Issuing Lender or such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of demand, to the Agent for its account or the account of the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as applicable, from time to time as specified by the Issuing Lender or a Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Lender or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.<br>
<br>
(d) Notification and Determination of Additional Costs.  Each of the Agent and each Lender agrees to notify the Borrowers of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Agent or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, the failure of the Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall not release the Borrowers from any of their respective obligations hereunder; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, shall not be entitled to compensation for any such amount relating to any period ending more than six months prior to the date that the Agent or such Lender, as applicable, first notifies the Borrowers in writing thereof.  The Agent and or such Lender agrees to furnish to the Borrowers a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by the Agent or such Lender for compensation under this Section.  Absent manifest error, determinations by the Agent or any Lender of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.2 Suspension of LIBOR Loans.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period:<br>
<br>
(a) the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or<br>
<br>
(b) the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;<br>
<br>
then the Agent shall give the Borrowers and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Loans, Continue LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans and the Borrowers shall, on the last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Loan, either repay such Loan or Convert such Loan into a Base Rate Loan.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.3 Illegality.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it becomes unlawful for any Lender  to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.6 shall be applicable).<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.4 Compensation.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:<br>
<br>
(a) any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or<br>
<br>
(b) any failure by the Borrowers for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article V to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.<br>
<br>
Upon the Borrowers' request, any Lender requesting compensation under this Section shall provide the Borrowers with a statement setting forth a brief explanation of the basis for requesting such compensation and the method and calculation for determining the amount thereof.  Each Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods generally applied by such Lender and may include, without limitation, administrative costs as a component of such loss, cost or expense.  Such statements shall be prima facie evidence of amounts due and owing hereunder.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.5 Affected Lenders.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</b>
If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.12 or 4.1, and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, or (b) the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1(b) or 4.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections, then, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrowers, within thirty (30) days of such request for compensation or suspension, as applicable, may either (i) demand that such Lender (the "Affected Lender"), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Commitments to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5(d) for a purchase price equal to the aggregate principal balance of Loans then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, or (ii) pay to the Affected Lender the aggregate principal balance of Loans then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, whereupon the Affected Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.  Each of the Agent and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at no time shall the Agent, such Affected Lender nor any other Lender be obligated in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  The exercise by the Borrowers of their rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers' sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders.  The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrowers' obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 3.12, 4.1 or 4.4.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.6 Treatment of Affected Loans.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1(b), 4.2 or 4.3, then such Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 4.1(b) or 4.3, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrowers with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1 or 4.3 that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:<br>
<br>
(a) to the extent that such Lender's LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and<br>
<br>
(b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.<br>
If such Lender gives notice to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1 or 4.3 that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender's LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Revolving Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 4.7 Change of Lending Office.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
|Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected by the matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.12, 4.1 or 4.3 to reduce the liability of the Borrowers or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Agent or any Lender take any action or impose any cost under Sections 3.12, 4.1, 4.2 or 4.6 unless the Agent or such Lender is generally imposing similar charges on, or taking similar actions with respect to, its other similarly situated
borrowers.

Section 4.8 Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article IV shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article IV.

The Borrowers, the Subsidiaries and the other Loan Parties have insurance covering the Borrowers, the Subsidiaries and the other Loan Parties and their respective Properties (the cost of such insurance being borne by the insured thereunder) in such amounts and against such risks and casualties as are customary (as determined by Parent in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment) for Persons or Properties of similar character and location, due regard being given to the type of improvements thereon, their construction, location, use and occupancy.

The transaction evidenced by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents is in the best interests of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties and the creditors of such Persons.  The direct and indirect benefits to inure to the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute substantially more than "reasonably equivalent value" (as such term is used in section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code) and "valuable consideration," "fair value," and "fair consideration" (as such terms are used in any applicable state fraudulent conveyance law), in exchange for the benefits to be provided by the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and but for the willingness of the Borrowers to be co-borrowers and of each Guarantor to guaranty the Obligations, the Borrowers would be unable to obtain the financing contemplated hereunder which financing will enable the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties to have available financing to conduct and expand their business.  The Borrowers and the other Loan Parties constitute a single integrated financial enterprise and each receives a benefit from the availability of credit under this Agreement to the Borrowers.<br>

<br>
(dd) No Event of Default.  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.<br>
<br>
(ee) Subordination.  None of the Borrowers, the Subsidiaries or any other Loan Party is a party to or bound by any agreement, instrument or indenture that may require the subordination in right or time of payment of any of the Obligations to any other indebtedness or obligation of any of such Persons; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any right of the holder of secured indebtedness to prior payment from the collateral for such indebtedness or the obligation to pay Indebtedness having a maturity date prior to the Termination Date.&nbsp;<br>

Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and except with respect to items requiring the unanimous consent or approval of the Lenders under Section 12.6, unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Agent that it specifically objects to the recommendation or determination of the Agent (together with a written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within the applicable time period for reply, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented to such recommendation or determination.<br>

Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or other Affiliates.

Section 11.7 Indemnification of Agent.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lender's respective Commitment Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, "Indemnifiable Amounts"); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct or if the Agent fails to follow the written direction of the Requisite Lenders unless such failure is pursuant to the reasonable advice of counsel of which the Lenders have received notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to the preceding proviso, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so) promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees of the
counsel (s) of the Agent's own choosing) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration or enforcement of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any "lender liability" suit or claim brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Agent that the Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrowers shall reimburse the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 11.8 Successor Agent.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
The Agent may resign at any time as Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers.  The Agent may be removed as Agent under the Loan Documents as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Requisite Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as the Agent).  Any such removal or resignation shall also constitute Agent's resignation as Swingline Lender and may, at such Agent's option, also constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Agent, in the case of the removal of the Agent under the immediately preceding sentence) shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent and Swingline Lender, which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be subject to the Borrowers' approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that the Borrowers shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender and its affiliates as a successor Agent and Swingline Lender).  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the resigning Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Lenders' removal of the resigning Agent, then the resigning or removed Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having total combined assets of at least $50,000,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent or Swingline Lender hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent and Swingline Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents as Agent and Swingline Lender.  After any Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and all provisions of this Agreement relating to Swingline Loans shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent or Swingline Lender under the Loan Documents.&nbsp;<br>

Section 11.9 Titled Agents.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
Each of the Titled Agents in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles of "Lead Arranger", "Co-Documentation Agent" and "Syndication Agent" are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Agent, the Borrowers or any Lender and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.<br>

ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE LENDERS, THE AGENT AND THE BORROWERS HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT OR TRIBUNAL IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED BY OR AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER SUIT, CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWERS, THE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE.<br>

Section 12.5 Successors and Assigns.&nbsp;<br>
</b><br>
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all Lenders and any such assignment or other transfer to which all of the Lenders have not so consented shall be null and void.<br>
<br>
(b) Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Loans at, to or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an affiliate of such Lender except to the extent such transfer would result in increased costs to the Borrowers.<br>
<br>
(c) Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or the Obligations owing to such Lender; provided, however, (i) any such participating interest must be for a constant and not a varying percentage interest, (ii) no Lender may grant a participating interest in its Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of Notes held by it, in an amount less than $5,000,000 and (iii) after giving effect to any such participation by a Lender, the amount of its Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of Notes held by it, in which it has not granted any participating interests must be equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3, no Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, such Lender may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase, or extend the term or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination of, such Lender's Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (v) release any Guarantor (except as otherwise permitted under Section 7.12(b)).  An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by Section 12.5(d) or (e) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (c).  The selling Lender shall notify the Agent and the Borrowers of the sale of any participation hereunder and, if requested by the Agent, certify to the Agent that such participation is permitted hereunder.<br>
<br>
(d) Any Lender may with the prior written consent of the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Parent (which consent, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each an "Assignee") all or a portion of its Commitment and its other rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; provided, however, (i) no such consent by the Parent shall be required in the case of any assignment to (x) another Lender, or (y) if such affiliate is an Eligible Assignee, any affiliate of such Lender or of  another Lender, and no such consent by the Agent shall be required in the case of any assignment by a Lender to any affiliate of such Lender if such affiliate is an Eligible Assignee (provided that after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, a Lender may assign to a Person that is not an Eligible Assignee with only the prior written consent of Agent); (ii) any partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and after giving effect to such partial assignment the assigning Lender retains a Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, holds Notes having an aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $10,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (provided, however, the conditions set forth in this subsection (ii) shall not apply to any full assignment of by any Lender of its Commitment); and (iii) each such assignment shall be effected by means of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.  In connection with such assignment, the assignor may assign all or any portion of its Competitive Advance Note and the Competitive Advances at the time owing to it, which, if so assigned, shall be assigned in such proportion as the assignor and assignee agree, but in no event shall the assignee acquire an interest in the Competitive Advances of the assignor of less than $10,000,000; provided, however, that in the event such assignor assigns all of its Commitment, such assignor shall assign all of its Competitive Advance Note and Competitive Advances, if any, in connection therewith.  Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be deemed to be a Lender party to this Agreement as of the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (d), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate.  In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500.<br>
<br>
(e) The Agent shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of each Lender from time to time (the "Register").  The Agent shall give each Lender and the Borrowers notice of the assignment by any Lender of its rights as contemplated by this Section.  The Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register and copies of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to the Agent.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender, together with each Note subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement has been completed and if the Agent receives the processing and recording fee described in Section 12.5(d) above, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers.<br>
<br>
(f) In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and such Loans and Notes shall be fully transferable as provided therein.  No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.<br>
<br>
(g) A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Assignees and Participants (including prospective Assignees and Participants) subject to compliance with Section 12.8.<br>
<br>
(h) Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
(i) Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrowers and the Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.<br>

<b>
Section 12.6 Amendments.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document may be amended, and the performance or observance by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of the Borrowers).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing, and signed by all of the Lenders (or the Agent at the written direction of the Lenders), do any of the following: (i) increase the Commitments of the Lenders (except as contemplated by Section 2.15) or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations; (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest rates that have accrued or that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or Fees or other Obligations; (iii) reduce the amount of any Fees payable hereunder; (iv) postpone any date fixed for any payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Loans or any other Obligations, or extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Termination Date; (v) change the Commitment Percentages (except as a result of any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments contemplated by Section 2.15, 3.11(b) or 4.5) or amend or otherwise modify the provisions of Section 3.2; (vi)  modify the definition of the term "Requisite Lenders", modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders (including all of the Lenders) required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof, including without limitation, any modification of this Section if such modification would have such effect; or (vii) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty (except as otherwise permitted under Section 7.12(b)) or release any Borrower from its obligations under the Loan Documents (except as provided in Section 7.12(c) with respect to Gables-TN).  Further, no amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.2 or the obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of the Swingline Lender.  Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.4 or the obligations or rights of the Issuing Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of the Issuing Lender.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrowers shall entitle the Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.<br>
<br>
<b>
Section 12.7 Nonliability of Agent and Lenders.&nbsp;<br>
