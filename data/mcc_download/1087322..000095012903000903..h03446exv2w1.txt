1123(a)(1), Administrative Claims, Professional Fee Claims, and Priority
Unsecured Tax Claims are not classified under the Plan, and the treatment of
those Claims is set forth in Article 4 of the Plan.

Debtors for the purpose of implementing this Plan, including for purpose of
voting, confirmation, and Distributions to be made under the Plan. Pursuant to
such Confirmation Order: (i) all assets and liabilities of the Debtors will be
deemed merged, (ii) all guarantees by one of the Debtors of the obligations of
any of the other Debtors will be deemed eliminated so that any Claim against any
of the Debtors and any guaranty thereof executed by any other of the Debtors and
any joint or several liability of any of the Debtors will be deemed to be one
obligation of the Debtors, and (iii) each and every Claim filed or to be filed
in the Chapter 11 Cases of any of the Debtors will be deemed filed against the
Debtors and will be deemed one Claim against and a single obligation of the
Debtors. No attempt shall be made by the Debtors to differentiate, separate or
segregate the assets and liabilities of any of the Debtors. This consolidation
shall not result in, or cause, the imposition of Liens upon assets unless
specifically provided in this Plan.

Date. The holder of a Class 3 General Unsecured Claim that is a Disputed Claim
that later becomes an Allowed Claim will receive from the Disputed Claim
Reserve, 10 days after it is allowed, the Pro Rata share of Available Cash that
it would have received prior to the Claim's allowance had the Claim been an
Allowed Claim since the Effective Date. Thereafter, the Class 3 General
Unsecured Claim that has become an Allowed Claim will share in Distributions
with the other Allowed Class 3 General Unsecured Claims.

         5.4 TREATMENT OF CLASS 4 ALLOWED SUBORDINATED CLAIMS. Holders of
Allowed Class 4 Subordinated Claims shall not be entitled to receive any
Distributions under the Plan.

         5.5 TREATMENT OF CLASS 5 INTERESTS. On the Effective Date, all Class 5
Interests shall be cancelled in accordance with Section 7.2.1 of the Plan, and
holders of Class 5 Interests shall not be entitled to receive any Distribution
under the Plan.

                    EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

         6.1 REJECTION. All Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases not
otherwise assumed or rejected pursuant to a Final Order entered before the
Effective Date shall be deemed rejected as of the Confirmation Date. Pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code section 365(a), the Plan constitutes a

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

motion by the Debtors to reject all executory contracts and unexpired leases not
otherwise assumed or rejected pursuant to a Final Order entered before the
Effective Date.

         6.2 APPROVAL OF REJECTION. Entry of the Confirmation Order shall
constitute the approval, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 365(a), of the
rejection of the remaining Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.

         6.3 REJECTION CLAIMS. Unless the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Code,
or the Bankruptcy Rules establish an earlier deadline concerning the rejection
of particular Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases, any Claim arising out of
the rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases under Sections 6.1 of
the Plan, or arising out of the rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired
Leases after the Bar Date and before the Confirmation Date, must be filed with
the Bankruptcy Court and served on the Debtors and Plan Agents within thirty
(30) days after the Confirmation Date, or if an earlier date has been set by the
Court, on the earlier date. Any Claims not filed within that time period will be
extinguished and forever barred, and therefore will not receive any
Distributions under the Plan. Any Claims arising out of the rejection of an
Executory Contract or Unexpired Leases pursuant to a Final Order entered before
the Bar Date must have been filed before the Bar Date; otherwise those Claims
are extinguished and forever barred, and therefore will not receive
Distributions under the Plan. All Claims arising from the rejection of an
Executory Contract shall be treated as a Class 3 General Unsecured Claim under
the Plan.

         6.4 EMPLOYEE CLAIMS (COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS). To the extent
not already rejected pursuant to a Final Order, all employment and retirement
practices and policies and all compensation, retirement and employee benefit
plans, policies and programs of the Debtors applicable to their current or
former directors, officers, or employees (including all savings plans,
retirement plans, health care plans, accrued unpaid vacation, sick leave,
medical benefits, incentive plans, workers' compensation programs, and life,
disability and other insurance plans), to the extent arising from Executory
Contracts, shall be rejected as of the Confirmation Date, and shall not be
binding on the Liquidating Debtors or Plan Agents to any extent.

         6.5 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. Subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Date, the obligations of the Debtors and Liquidating Debtors, to
indemnify, defend, reimburse or limit the liability of directors or officers who
were or are directors or officers of the Debtors at any time, against any claims
or causes of action as provided in the Debtors' certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, applicable state law, contract, or otherwise shall not survive
confirmation of the Plan and shall be discharged, other than the General Plan
Agent and H. Malcolm Lovett, Jr. in his role as the sole officer and director
and financial advisor or in any other capacity of the Debtors prior to the
Effective Date.

                         MEANS FOR EXECUTION OF THE PLAN

         7.1 THE PLAN AGENTS.

         7.1.1 SELECTION OF PLAN AGENTS: GENERAL AND LIMITED PLAN AGENTS. There

candidates to serve as the Limited Plan Agents under the Plan. The Proponents
shall also negotiate a fee agreement with H. Malcolm Lovett, Jr. The Limited
Plan Agents will not receive fees, but will be reimbursed for reasonable
expenses incurred in their role as Limited Plan Agents. The Debtors shall file
with the Bankruptcy Court and serve on the Committee at least ten (10) days
before the hearing on the Disclosure Statement a disclosure identifying the

         7.1.2 RESIGNATION OF PLAN AGENT. A Plan Agent may resign such position
only by a written instrument filed with the Bankruptcy Court at least sixty (60)
days before the proposed effective date of resignation. A Plan Agent shall
continue to serve as Plan Agent after the filing of the resignation until the
proposed effective date, which shall be the effective date of appointment of a
successor Plan Agent in accordance with Section 7.1.3 of the Plan.

         7.1.3 APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR PLAN AGENT.

                           7.1.3.1 APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR PLAN AGENT. In the
                  event of a vacancy by reason of the death of a Plan Agent or
                  prospective vacancy by reason of resignation, a successor Plan
                  Agent shall be selected and appointed by unanimous approval of
                  the remaining Plan Agents. The remaining Plan Agents must
                  notify the Court of the vacancy or prospective vacancy as soon
                  as they become aware of such, and may appoint a successor Plan
                  Agent as soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty
                  (60) days after the occurrence of the vacancy or, in the case
                  of resignation, at least fifteen (15) days before the
                  effective date of such resignation. If the remaining Plan
                  Agents fail to appoint a successor Plan Agent within the
                  applicable period, any of the remaining Plan Agents or holders
                  of 30% or more in amount of Allowed Class 3 General Unsecured
                  Claims may nominate a successor Plan Agent. On such
                  nomination, the remaining Plan Agents shall provide all
                  holders of Allowed Class 3 General Unsecured Claims with a
                  notice setting forth (i) the name of the nominated Plan Agent,
                  (ii) if the nominated Plan agent will replace a General Plan
                  Agent, the proposed compensation for the nominated General
                  Plan Agent, (iii) a ballot, and (iv) the date such ballot must
                  be returned to the remaining Plan Agents. The election of a
                  successor Plan Agent shall be effective on approval by holders
                  of a majority of Allowed Class 3 General Unsecured Claims (in
                  terms of amount so voted).

                  Every successor Plan Agent appointed pursuant to the Plan
                  shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the remaining Plan
                  Agents and the retiring Plan Agent, if any, an instrument
                  accepting the appointment subject to the terms and provisions
                  of the Plan. The successor Plan Agent shall automatically
                  succeed to the record ownership of the New Common Stock of the
                  Debtors held by the retiring Plan Agent. Without any further
                  act, deed or conveyance, the successor Plan Agent shall become
                  vested with all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the
                  retiring Plan Agent under the Plan, except that the successor
                  Plan Agent shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of
                  the retiring Plan Agent.

compensation, but will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in their
role as Limited Plan Agents.

         7.1.5 DEFERRAL OF RESPONSIBILITY BY THE LIMITED PLAN AGENTS. The
Limited Plan Agents shall, unilaterally and without breach of any duty or

equally to be held and voted in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Plan. The Plan Agents shall be the record owners of the New Common Stock of the
Liquidating Debtors, which shall constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Liquidating Debtors. The Plan Agents shall hold
the New Common Stock of the Liquidating Debtors for the benefit of the holders
of Allowed Claims against the Debtors. The Plan Agents shall vote such shares at
all appropriate times to elect themselves as the sole directors and officers of
the Liquidating Debtors and otherwise to implement the terms and provisions of
the Plan.

         7.2.2 EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS AND CORPORATE ACTION. The Liquidating
Debtors shall deliver all documents and perform all actions reasonably
contemplated with respect to implementation of the Plan. The Plan Agents are

         8.1 DISTRIBUTIONS ON ALLOWED CLAIMS ONLY. Distributions under the Plan

Liquidating Debtors, shall make Distributions from only Available Cash, except

Plan Agents deem appropriate under the circumstances.

         8.5 MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS. To the extent a Distribution to a particular

Debtors, may hold such Distribution until the final Distribution or until the
aggregate of Distributions to such Claimant exceeds $100.00.

         8.6 UNDELIVERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS. If a Distribution to any Claimholder
is returned as undeliverable, the Plan Agents, on behalf of the Liquidating
Debtors, shall use reasonable efforts to determine such Claimholder's then
current address, and no further Distributions shall be made

<PAGE>

to such Claimholder unless and until the Plan Agents are notified of such
Claimholder's then current address.

         8.7 TREATMENT OF UNCLAIMED OR UNDELIVERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS. If any
Person entitled to Distributions of Available Cash or Estate Property under the
Plan cannot be located on the Effective Date or any time thereafter, then,
subject to the provisions of Article 12 and this Section 8.7, such Available
Cash or Estate Property shall be set aside, and, in the case of Available Cash,
held in an interest-bearing account or fund maintained by the Plan Agents on
behalf of such Person. If such Person is located within 180 days of the Initial
Distribution Date, such Available Cash shall be paid or distributed to such
Person without interest. If such Person cannot be located within 180 days of the
Initial Distribution Date, then (i) such Person shall no longer be deemed to be
a Claimant, and (ii) any Available Cash and Estate Property and interest and
proceeds thereon allocable to such Person, net of the allocable portion of taxes
paid by the Debtors, shall be part of the Available Cash or Estate Property free
and clear of and from any claim to such property by or on behalf of such Person
(who shall be deemed to have released such claim) and shall be otherwise
distributed as provided in the Plan, with such adjustments as are required to
take into account that such Person is no longer deemed a Claimholder.

         8.8 UNCASHED CHECKS. All checks constituting a Distribution by the Plan
Agents, on behalf of the Liquidating Debtors, shall have a voiding provision
causing such check to become void if not cashed within 180 days. To the extent
that a check becomes void, the Distribution represented by the check shall
revert to the Liquidating Debtors.

         8.9 WITHHOLDING. The Plan Agents, on behalf of the Liquidating Debtors,
may withhold from the amount distributable from the Debtors at any time to any
Person (except with respect to the Internal Revenue Service) such sum or sums as
may be sufficient to pay any tax or taxes or other charge or charges that have
been or may be imposed on such Person or upon the Debtors with respect to the
amount distributable or to be distributed under the income tax laws of the
United States or of any state or political subdivision or entity by reason of
any Distribution provided for in this Article 8, whenever such withholding is
determined by the Plan Agents in their discretion to be required by any law,
regulation, rule, ruling, directive or other governmental requirement, and the
Plan Agents, in the exercise of their discretion and judgment, may enter into
agreements, on behalf of the Liquidating Debtors, with taxing or other
authorities for the payment of such amounts as may be withheld in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.9. Notwithstanding the foregoing but
without prejudice to the Plan Agents' rights hereunder, such Person shall have
the right with respect to the United States, or any state, or any political
subdivision of either, to contest the imposition of any tax or other charge by
reason of any Distribution hereunder.

         8.10 CLAIMS OF LESS THAN $25.00. No claim in the amount of less than
$25.00 shall receive Distributions under the Plan unless the Claimholder makes a
request in writing to the Plan Agents within sixty (60) days of the Effective
Date. Until and unless a request is made as provided in the preceding sentence,
the claim of less than $25.00 shall be deemed a Disputed Claim.

cases, advisors, attorneys, business consultants, representatives, financial
advisors, investment bankers or agents and any of such parties' successors and
assigns, for any act or omission in connection with, relating to, or arising out

                        PROVISIONS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF
                          OBJECTIONS TO PROOFS OF CLAIM

         11.1 RIGHT TO OBJECT TO CLAIMS. The Plan Agents, on behalf of the
Liquidating Debtors, shall have the right to examine and object to any Claims
filed in Debtors' chapter 11 cases, including Administrative Claims, and shall
have the right to object to and contest the allowance of any such Claims.

         11.2 DEADLINE FOR OBJECTING TO CLAIMS. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Plan Agents must file any objections to Claims with the Bankruptcy
Court and serve a copy of the objection on the subject Claimant before the
expiration of one-hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Date (unless
such time period is further extended by subsequent orders of the Bankruptcy
Court); otherwise such Claim shall be deemed Allowed in accordance with
Bankruptcy Code section 502.

                     GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO RESERVES

         12.1 DISPUTED CLAIM RESERVE. On the Effective Date, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Plan Agents shall establish, on behalf of the
Liquidating Debtors, a Disputed Claim Reserve funded with Available Cash in an
amount equal to the Distributions reserved for the holders of Disputed Claims.
The Plan Agents shall create a separate account for the Disputed Claim Reserve.
The Disputed Claim Reserve shall be held in trust for the benefit of holders of
Allowed Claims whose Distributions are unclaimed and the holders of Disputed
Claims pending determination of their entitlement to Distributions under the
Plan. When a Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim, the Plan Agents, on behalf
of the Liquidating Debtors, shall release and deliver the Distribution reserved
for the particular Disputed Claim (net of distribution cost) from the Disputed
Claim Reserve 10 days after the Allowance Date or the next Distribution Date. If
the Court disallows the Disputed Claim, the proceeds therefor shall be part of
the Available Cash or Estate Property free and clear of any liens, claims,
interest, or other encumbrances and shall be distributed in accordance with the
Plan. To the extent any funds held in the Disputed Claim Reserve relate to (i)
Administrative Claims or (ii) Class 1 Priority Unsecured Non-Tax Claims or a
Priority Unsecured Tax Claims that have either been disallowed by the Bankruptcy
Court or are no longer claimed as evidenced by a written release of such Claim
or the failure to seek allowance of such Claim within six (6) months from the
Effective


                                      -15-

Date, then such funds shall become Available Cash under the Plan. The Disputed
Claim Reserve shall be dissolved once all required payments have been made.

         12.2 OPERATING RESERVE. On the Effective Date, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Plan Agents, on behalf of the Liquidating Debtors,
shall establish the Operating Reserve funded periodically with Available Cash in
an amount determined by the Plan Agents, to be reasonably necessary to pay
anticipated Liquidation Costs, fund litigation, fund contingent liabilities, and
otherwise conduct the affairs of the Liquidating Debtors. The Operating Reserve
and the Professional Fee Reserve shall be held in the same bank account.

         12.3 PROFESSIONAL FEE RESERVE.

         On the Effective Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Plan
Agents shall establish the Professional Fee Reserve in an amount equal to the
estimated Professional Fees Claims. The funds in the Professional Fee Reserve
shall be used solely for the payment of Allowed Professional Fee Claims. To the
extent funds held in the Professional Fee Reserve have either been disallowed by
the Bankruptcy Court or are no longer claimed as evidenced by a written release
of such Claim or the failure to seek allowance of such Claim within twenty (20)
days of the Effective Date, then such funds become Available Cash under the
Plan. The Professional Fee Reserve shall be dissolved once all required payments
have been made. Any funds remaining after all required payments have been made
will become Available Cash under the Plan. The Operating Reserve and the
Professional Fee Reserve shall be held in the same bank account.

         13.1 RIGHT TO ENFORCE, COMPROMISE, OR ADJUST ESTATE CLAIMS. Pursuant

Agents shall have, for the benefit of the Liquidating Debtors' Estate, the full
power, authority, and standing to prosecute, compromise, or otherwise resolve
any Avoidance Actions and any other claims and causes of action constituting
Estate Property. All proceeds derived from the Avoidance Actions or other claims
and causes of action shall become Estate Property and distributed as Available
Cash in accordance with the Plan. The Liquidating Debtors shall not be subject
to any counterclaims with respect to the Avoidance Actions and any other claims
and causes of actions constituting Estate Property; provided, however, that the
Avoidance Actions and any other claims and causes of action constituting Estate
Property will be subject to any setoff rights.
